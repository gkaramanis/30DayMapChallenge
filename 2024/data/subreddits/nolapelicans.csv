2024-09-06,1725629728,Shrinking your gift: the curious case of Brandon Ingram's threes,"\[Hello, everyone! This post was originally meant for the broader NBA audience at r/nba, so please forgive some of the no-duh stuff for Pelicans fans. But hopefully, you'll enjoy it.\]

Brandon Ingram is at a crossroads.

The former All-Star, whose 27th birthday was just a few days ago, is seeking a maximum contract extension: four years and just north of $200 million. Unfortunately for him, neither his current team, the New Orleans Pelicans, nor any of the leagues 29 others appear inclined to give it to him. Ingram is a very good player, but he isnt a great one  although he could be if he so chose.

It starts and comes near to ending with Ingrams three-point shot. Ingrams career long-range shooting stats are bizarre:

**Season | 3PA/gm | 3PAr | 3P%**

2016-17 | 2.4 | 27.3% | 29.4%

2017-18 | 1.8 |13.8% | 39.0%

2018-19 | 1.8 | 12.9% | 33.0%

2019-20 | 6.2 | 35.0% | 39.1%

2020-21 | 6.1 | 34.1% | 38.1%

2021-22 | 4.1 | 23.0% | 32.7%

2022-23 | 3.6 | 19.6% | 39.0%

2023-24 | 3.8 | 23.8% | 35.5%

Ingram started as a three-point non-believer while he got his NBA footing under him in Los Angeles, but his triple attempt rate skyrocketed in 2019-20, his first year as a New Orleans Pelican. Under coach Alvin Gentry and playing next to point guards like Jrue Holiday and Lonzo Ball, Ingram launched from deep with a quickfire trebuchets volume and accuracy.[ Better health and a revamped shot form](https://www.nola.com/sports/pelicans/from-the-ground-up-how-brandon-ingram-a-finalist-for-most-improved-player-rebuilt-his/article_2dd75120-e16b-11ea-be5f-a76618b8c464.html#:~:text=This%20season%2C%20Ingram%20shot%2042%25%20on%204.8%20catch-and-shoot,game%20in%20his%20final%20season%20with%20the%20Lakers.) masterminded by shooting coach Fred Vinson didnt hurt, either.

\[Thanks for reading! As always, I've collected a bunch of illustrative video clips and GIFS in addition to a couple of tables. They [can be viewed in-context in one place here.](https://www.basketballpoetry.com/p/shrinking-your-gift-the-curious-case)\]

Ingram had nearly identical numbers under Stan Van Gundy in 2020-21, but everything changed in the 2021-22 season. Ingrams three-point rate dropped significantly thanks to three factors. First, Zion Williamson (and his drive-and-kicks) missed the entire season, depleting Ingrams catch-and-shoot opportunities. Second, there was no bonafide point guard on the roster  CJ McCollum was a late-trade addition, but hes more of a combo guard than a floor general. And finally, one-and-done Van Gundy was replaced by Willie Green, who was less militant about forcing Ingram to jack up threes.

With fewer ballhandlers available, Ingram took on more of an on-ball playmaker role, setting a then-career-high in assists. The byproduct of that shift and the personnel issues we discussed: fewer catch-and-shoot opportunities. Thats a real problem for Ingram. Most players have a better conversion rate on catch-and-shoots than pull-ups, but theres a [wider discrepancy for Ingram](https://www.nba.com/stats/player/1627742/shots-dash?SeasonType=Regular+Season&amp;Season=2018-19) than similar ballhandling stars: [\[click here for for table](https://www.basketballpoetry.com/p/shrinking-your-gift-the-curious-case), I'm too lazy to format another table in Reddit\]

The TL;DR: Ingram is good-to-great at catch-and-shoot triples and quite bad at pull-ups!

By comparison, Khris Middleton, who fills a parallel role for the Milwaukee Bucks, [has hit at least 36% on pull-up threes in four of the last five season](https://www.nba.com/stats/player/203114/shots-dash?SeasonSegment=&amp;PerMode=PerGame&amp;SeasonType=Regular+Season&amp;Season=2019-20)s. Kevin Durant, a superior player with similar tendencies to Ingram, [has hit at least 37% in three of the last four](https://www.nba.com/stats/player/201142/shots-dash?SeasonType=Regular+Season&amp;Season=2018-19) (he missed all of 2019-20). Its a weapon that nearly all perimeter scorers can unsheathe to some extent.

Ingram has always had far more comfort pulling up from the midrange, where hes very prolific and very good  [46% or higher](https://cleaningtheglass.com/stats/player/1742#tab-shooting_accuracy) in each of the last four seasons. Midrange jumpers have different mechanics than three-point jumpers, and Ingram is more confident and fluid when hes closer to the basket: \[[video here](https://www.basketballpoetry.com/p/shrinking-your-gift-the-curious-case)\]

Ingram has a relatively slow but high release. Its a far better form for shooting over the top of defenders in the midrange than it is for creating space from behind the arc: \[[video here](https://www.basketballpoetry.com/p/shrinking-your-gift-the-curious-case)\]

Ingrams defenders constantly go under picks, giving him plenty of space to walk into an open three-pointer, but he prefers to take one step inside the arc even when his screener pancakes the defender like [an angry Whomp](https://www.mariowiki.com/Whomp): \[[video here](https://www.basketballpoetry.com/p/shrinking-your-gift-the-curious-case)\]

The pull-ups are one thing. Ingram isnt comfortable with them and likely never will be. However, Ingram passes up far too many open catch-and-shoots, a shot hes good at! The record-scratch moments often end with a forced jumper in traffic or a drive to nowhere that needs an offensive reset.

Far too often, weve heard Pelicans play-by-play broadcaster Joel Meyers despondently announce, Ingram, from 20& and \[insert opposing player\] corrals the rebound. This is not an NBA play: \[[sad video here](https://www.basketballpoetry.com/p/shrinking-your-gift-the-curious-case)\]

Defenders know they can run Ingram off the three-point line; in fact, he *wants* to be pushed into his comfort zone (and coach Green has been unwilling to push him back out). His reluctance to fire from deep hinders an offense that needs to space the floor around Zion Williamson to reach its ceiling  and it will inhibit any other team that considers trading for him, too. In this league, its nearly impossible to be an effective non-big second or third banana if you cant shoot from deep.

The crazy thing is that weve seen Ingram succeed at a significantly higher level from downtown; can that player return? More importantly, is he *willing* to return? I never want to put much stock in social media posts, especially in this economy. But Ingram did [post a curiously salient video](https://x.com/NickVanExit/status/1829637885890322782) a few days ago in which a motivational speaker tells his rapturous audience that they cannot stay in environments where people dont know the true value of you. If you stay in environments where people dont recognize the value of you, youll shrink your gift to the size of what they can stand.

I like this quote, but Ingram is misunderstanding the context. The Pelicans (and the rest of the league) dont want to shrink Ingrams gifts. They want him to *expand* his gifts like those inflatable lawn Christmas presents!

In some ways, the stage is set for Ingram to thrive. Zion Williamson is healthy and looking better than ever (stop me if youve heard that before), and the trade for Dejounte Murray gives the Pelicans the best point guard theyve had since Lonzo Ball. You may be surprised to learn that Zion and Ingram on the court *without* CJ McCollum [last season had a net rating of +13.4](https://cleaningtheglass.com/stats/team/19/lineups?on=4572&amp;on=1742&amp;off=2390#tab-four_factors) in 706 possessions, in the 98th percentile; with McCollum likely moving to the bench, we should see more of those minutes.

New Orleans now has two players capable of getting both feet into the paint and spraying the ball to open shooters. [Zion was a top-10 three-point creator](https://www.pbpstats.com/totals/nba/player?Season=2023-24&amp;SeasonType=Regular%2BSeason) on a per-possession basis last season (although not many of those went to Ingram), and Murray might approach similar numbers without having to share the rock with Trae Young. If head coach Green and offensive guru James Borrego can effectively create Williamson/Murray actions that suck in the defense, Ingram should have far more catch-and-shoot opportunities.

Is Ingram willing to screen and pop for Murray or Williamson? (Trey Murphy will be a superstar in that role, but Ingram will have chances, too.) Is he willing to show more activity off the ball? Id like to see Ingram sliding more along the perimeter in reaction to Zion and Murrays forays into the paint; too often, he appears unaware that he can create passing lanes for others with even subtle shifts. More purposeful movement like this, please: \[[video here](https://www.basketballpoetry.com/p/shrinking-your-gift-the-curious-case)\]

If Ingram *can* rediscover his three-point appetite, he would be an excellent fit for this Pelicans team  or most other contenders. Shot selection aside, hes a far more complete player than his reputation suggests.

For example, Ingram has sneakily become a very good passer. Hes not always the quickest decision-maker, and he can pound the ball a bit too much for my liking. But hes learned how to leverage the attention he draws to spring teammates open. Hell put the ball on the floor and fake a shot for the sole purpose of wedging open a narrow passing window: \[[video here](https://www.basketballpoetry.com/p/shrinking-your-gift-the-curious-case)\]

Hes also become an excellent pick-and-roll player. Ingram was in the 81st percentile for points per pick-and-roll possession, per Synergy. Hes become more creative with his use of space and angles: \[[video here](https://www.basketballpoetry.com/p/shrinking-your-gift-the-curious-case)\]

And defensively, Ingram has competed hard of late. His play on that end faltered when he initially moved to the Pelicans, but to his credit, his effort level has increased for the past few seasons. Hes not a top-flight defender, but hes not the weak link his skeletal ([Skelican](https://twitter.com/joelvenile/status/1719028831833432080)?) frame might suggest, either. Synergy rated him in the top quintile in pick-and-roll defense and isolations, and teams rarely targeted him (it helps to play a lot of minutes next to a player with a flashing neon bullseye on his jersey like McCollum).

Hes always been an excellent foul-drawer with high-end free throw percentages. Ingram is even a strong finisher at the rim (although he doesnt get there as much as Id like) and an underrated defensive rebounder.

Unfortunately, recency bias has been monstrously detrimental to his playoff character. Ingram rushed back from injury this season and then had to go up against Lu Dort, an elite, physical defender who gave a clearly hobbled Ingram zero breathing room, zero quarter, and zero mercy. But were just two years removed from Ingram averaging 27-6-6 on solid shooting while leading the Zion-less Pelicans to two wins against the top-seed Phoenix Suns in the playoffs, all with DPOY runner-up Mikal Bridges hung over his wiry shoulders like a particularly itchy scarf. It was a genuinely impressive performance that showed Ingrams playoff upside.

Theres a winning basketball player here. All Ingram has to do is move, say, two of his worst midrange attempts (perhaps those deep, one-legged runners hes inexcusably fond of) to the three-point line, a thing *hes already done,* and hed certainly get big dolla bills, yall!

Well, almost certainly. We alluded to Ingrams health (or lack thereof). Hes played just 64, 45, and 55 games over the last three years. I believe a market correction on availability is coming  see Kawhi Leonards sub-max deal and [Pat Rileys recent comments about Jimmy Butler](https://www.nytimes.com/athletic/5475423/2024/05/06/jimmy-butler-pat-riley-comments/) for two top-of-mind examples. Ingram may be one of the first victims of that mentality.

But we just saw an injury-prone 3-and-D superstar in OG Anunoby get pretty darn close to max money. Currently, Ingram is missing the 3 component that every non-superstar desperately needs to maximize their value. I talk about players needing to increase their three-point volume a lot, but Ingram is the extremely rare case in which weve already seen it! The lack of distributors, be they an elite point guard or a healthy Zion, can no longer be an excuse. Ingram will have catch-and-shoot opportunities; he has to take them.

I know who I am, [Ingram once said](https://www.nytimes.com/athletic/4809563/2023/08/27/brandon-ingram-team-usa/). In ways, I can get stuck and think my way is the best way. Theres at least a modicum of self-awareness here. The path to Ingram being a $200 million player (or close to it) is so easy to see. Ingram just needs to stop shrinking his own gifts.",NOLAPelicans,37,https://www.reddit.com/r/NOLAPelicans/comments/1fafci2/shrinking_your_gift_the_curious_case_of_brandon/

2024-10-17,1729186182,Hollinger has Los Pelicanos as No. 6 with 47-25 record,"So & where is this all going, exactly? On the one hand, the Pelicans are extremely talented. Just look at the names at the top of the roster and ponder how many other teams could plausibly claim that [CJ McCollum](https://www.nytimes.com/athletic/nba/player/cj-mccollum-6WC3b3hAgVqA0bZf/) is their sixth-best player. The offseason trade for [Dejounte Murray](https://www.nytimes.com/athletic/nba/player/dejounte-murray-tm3kUMS7SqPU8gXQ/) adds even more talent and makes them capable of potentially terrorizing defensive lineups at the one through four positions when paired with the likes of Herb Jones and Trey Murphy III.

If we took away every teams center, the Pelicans might win the championship. Alas, the Pelicans this year are more doughnut than beignet, with a glaring hole in the middle after losing [Jonas Valaniknas](https://www.nytimes.com/athletic/nba/player/jonas-valancinas-6YEYoGmoBlSfpHhs/) in free agency and trading [Larry Nance Jr.](https://www.nytimes.com/athletic/nba/player/larry-nance-jr-7CDgogl74yo30N8R/) in the Murray deal. One option is to move a big chunk of [Zion Williamson](https://www.nytimes.com/athletic/nba/player/zion-williamson-l6xjgWmi8X4OMdjm/)s minutes to the center spot, especially in the middle of games when he could terrorize bench units and his own defensive shortcomings should be less of an issue.

On the other hand, starting games with one of [Daniel Theis](https://www.nytimes.com/athletic/nba/player/daniel-theis-f5oLZZUnA6YoXneZ/), first-round project [Yves Missi](https://www.nytimes.com/athletic/nba/player/yves-missi-roTLGklczOWnnmeH/) or import [Karlo Matkovi](https://www.nytimes.com/athletic/nba/player/karlo-matkovic-2I9JUpJadAMBq30h/) feels like an unserious move for a potential contender, especially in a conference this loaded.

The obvious endgame is a trade of some kind, which takes us to the other half of the Pelicans drama this season: [Brandon Ingram](https://www.nytimes.com/athletic/nba/player/brandon-ingram-2qhGZCDXJ36YwTGU/). He is a good player who was perhaps unfairly maligned after returning from injury just to be thrown into the maw of a ferocious Thunder defense in the playoffs, without Williamson to boot. That said, Ingram has become almost [DeMar DeRozan](https://www.nytimes.com/athletic/nba/player/demar-derozan-1sVXxgSdLOq7XZwu/)-esque in his ability to turn an open catch-and-shoot 3 into a contested 22-foot 2, but he doesnt have the same midrange magic and foul-drawing acumen.

More importantly, Ingram has just one year left on his deal at $36 million, and the Pelicans seem reluctant to extend him for the full max. This is the right decision, especially on a team with clear spending restrictions (ones they might have thought harder about before extending McCollum at over $30 million a pop) and an expensive extension likely coming for Murphy.

Ideally, the Pels could exchange Ingram for an elite center, let Murray and Williamson share shot-creation duties and ride what would likely be a top-five defense to 50 wins. Were life that easy. Pulling off that trade requires a rival team with both a good center to trade and a need for Ingrams skill set. Scanning the other 29 rosters, its tough to thread a deal together without involving a third team (or a fourth!), which largely explains why nothing has happened yet.

This is also an interesting season for head coach Willie Green, by the way, and its somewhat connected to Ingram. The Pelicans were just 24th in 3-point frequency last season despite having several good shooters. Greens reluctance to embrace the 3-point line and lean harder into plus-shooting lineups offers echoes of his own career, one that was mostly spent shooting 18-foot pull-up 2s. [He has talked in preseason](https://www.nytimes.com/athletic/5830576/2024/10/09/pelicans-offense-3-pointers-zion/) about shooting 40 3s a game (New Orleans shot 32.6 last year, 25th in the league; 40 would have ranked second), so perhaps hes noticed the same problem. Whether this statement of strategic intent survives the first two-game losing streak in November remains to be seen.

So how do I project a team that is one of the most likely to make some kind of trade either before or during the season? I gave them a slight nudge from my projections given their greater ability to make moves in-season, perhaps even large ones. (The Pels have all of their own future picks.) But even if they trot out Theis and Matkovi as their center rotation, New Orleans is strong enough at the other positions to win plenty of games & as long as the Ingram-Williamson injury voodoo doll doesnt get another needle jab.",NOLAPelicans,21,https://www.reddit.com/r/NOLAPelicans/comments/1g5weqa/hollinger_has_los_pelicanos_as_no_6_with_4725/

I know that 1 reason he got as much playing time as he did was due to injuries on the Pelicans.

But lately it seems he barely even plays anymore, or if he does, it's only in garbage time or for a handful of minutes. Considering how much success he had early in the season, his benching to me seems puzzling, even if lots of guys that were injured have since come back. Like, I was expecting he'd still get at least 10-12 minutes a game off the bench, but dude barely even plays anymore. What's the deal? If he completely sucked when he was playing 20-25 minutes a game, OK, I get it, but he showed so much potential. Is it simply a case of ""He's a rookie, so other guys deserve to play over him"" or is something else going on?",NOLAPelicans,42,https://www.reddit.com/r/NOLAPelicans/comments/18s19o2/jordan_hawkins_whats_the_deal/

There will be more moves this summer. The most important potential move being, will the Pelicans resign Brandon Ingram or will they trade him, and what will they get in return if they do trade him. The other giant question is who is the starting center.

With that in mind, the Pelicans stand to have 5 new top 8 rotation guys. Massive change for a team that has been relatively stable with their roster over the last 3 years.

I'm not saying zion is ALWAYS fouled but it sure does seem like every game I see him drive the basketball,  get mauled, and then end up on the ground while the ball is turned over and going the other way with no whistle blown

Is it because of his playstyle? His size? 

I don't get why zion doesn't get fouls that guys like LeBron and Giannis get routinely?

Jimmy Butler got every whistle tonight!

2024-02-23,1708698412,"Zach Lowe on ""Uncertain Rotations"" and Point Zion"," 

## [Zion Williamson](https://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/4395628/zion-williamson) and the lowest pick-and-rolls in the league

The [New Orleans Pelicans](https://www.espn.com/nba/team/_/name/no/new-orleans-pelicans) are the league's most confounding good team. They are 34-22 after winning eight of nine, in sole possession of the No. 5 seed and boasting the West's fourth-best point differential. Their schedule is manageable. Projection systems give them between a 60% and 80% chance of nabbing a top-six seed in what promises to be a tense race to avoid the play-in.

They start four players generally considered below-average defenders, yet somehow rank in the top 10 in points allowed per possession for the second straight season. (Some of that is luck; New Orleans allows the second-most 3s, but its opponents have hit a league-low 34.6% from deep.)

In stretches, they look unstoppable -- the boulder rolling downhill. But there are quarters, halves, entire games when something just seems a little off. They are minus-15 with [CJ McCollum](https://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/2490149/cj-mccollum), [Brandon Ingram](https://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/3913176/brandon-ingram) and Williamson on the floor. Those are three ball-dominant players who like to operate from the midrange and in. Only McCollum is a dangerous high-volume 3-point shooter, and he deserves credit for migrating outward to accommodate Williamson and Ingram. (Ingram has launched more 3s recently, and is at 36%.)

Add a center, and both the spacing and the ballhandling hierarchy get clunky -- leaving one of Williamson and Ingram to manufacture something in tight confines while the other stands along the sideline. This has manifested in shaky crunch-time offense and blown leads; the Pels are 27th in points per possession in the last five minutes of close games.

Lineups with [Trey Murphy III](https://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/4397688/trey-murphy-iii) in Williamson's place have thrived. Coach Willie Green has used Williamson at center more over the past two weeks, but that remains a change-up; there will be full games where you won't see it. New Orleans' best Zion-at-center group -- McCollum, Murphy, Ingram, [Herbert Jones](https://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/4277813/herbert-jones), Williamson -- has logged only 22 minutes. I'd like to see more despite concerns about the defensive viability of Zion-at-center lineups.

It's nice to have options, but it's also nice to have certainty about who should play with whom -- and when. The Pelicans don't have that yet.

But their stars are so dynamic, they often make it work. The Pels have leaned more into Point Zion, and they are getting dynamite results with ultra-low-angle pick-and-rolls on the right wing between Williamson and their centers:

 

[Jonas Valanciunas](https://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/6477/jonas-valanciunas) sets that pick below the dotted line. Any lower, and you are nearly out of bounds. That is so low that going under the screen becomes dicey for defenses; get chipped -- as LeBron James does above -- and Williamson, going to his strong hand, is on top of the basket. Those plays also put the Pelicans' two weakest shooters in the action, maximizing spacing around the ball.

Even if you dodge the pick, Williamson is already close enough to the basket to plow to a layup. Help coverages:

 Williamson is running 17 pick-and-rolls per 100 possessions, a career high. The Pelicans have averaged 1.12 points directly out of those actions -- 25th among 192 ball handlers who have run at least 100 such plays, per Second Spectrum.

2024-05-07,1715094729,Remember when we thought Minnesota would be a good R1 matchup? ,"Been following them a lot the last 2 weeks or so. They are terrifying between Ant and KAT; they could easily be the W Conf Champs. 

Crazy to think that almost a majority of this community thought theyd be a great R1 matchup for the Pels a month ago. 

Edit: spelling ",NOLAPelicans,39,https://www.reddit.com/r/NOLAPelicans/comments/1cme988/remember_when_we_thought_minnesota_would_be_a/
2024-04-17,1713378757,This team is cursed. It's tough to keep watching.,"I've watched virtually every single game this season, from October to now, but this has become too much.  I might have to stop watching basketball altogether.

Last year we became the first team ever in the history of the league to have the 1st seed as late as December, and then not make the playoffs. (Yes, I understand there was still much of the season left, but to fall from 1 to 9 is insane). An absolutely gut wrenching season, considering Zion went out with a season ending injury in January while we were on top.

But I could handle it, because we had a pretty good excuse, our superstar player went down with an injury. Next season would be different. 

And it was. We got 49 wins and Zion played 70+ games, the most he's ever played. So surely we locked up a playoff spot right?

That's why I can't handle this cursed season. We're in danger of being the first 49-win team in the modern NBA to ever miss the playoffs. Zion got injured again with the same hamstring injury. And to count off, **we lose to the Lakers** **twice, our most hated ""rival,"" then we may get bounced by a team we literally are 5-0 this season.** I can't think of a more cursed or messed up script if I tried. Your superstar gets out injured after the same disappointment last year, and now you're going to lose the team you just beat 5 times in a row? And to think if Kings didn't give a all-time choke against the Suns up 4 with the ball with less than a minute left, we'd have the 6th seed and literally no one would be mad. I don't want to hear, ""well we can't rely on others,"" because it's mathematically possible to get 55, maybe even 60 wins in a season and miss the playoffs, you always need luck from other teams, we just got the most insane bad luck.

But that's not all. Then we get the news of Zion's injury, and David Griffin once again doesn't give us any information, total disrespect to the fans. All after the ""two weeks away from two weeks away"" mantra last year. I can't handle that. I'm out. I don't think I'm going to watch basketball again, this stuff is messed up and is not normal, it's literally cursed. I don't know how y'all feel, maybe I'm losing my damn mind, idk. I hope they prove me wrong on Friday, but not sure if I can bring myself watch that game or just check the score afterward.",NOLAPelicans,43,https://www.reddit.com/r/NOLAPelicans/comments/1c6hegc/this_team_is_cursed_its_tough_to_keep_watching/

That being said...after what I've seen these last few games...Dyson is untradeable. His defense is critical when Herb is on the bench. 

Matter of fact...I don't want to see anyone traded. This team is young...and it feels like things are finally starting to come together. Chemistry is building with every game.

2024-10-21,1729484505,5 Reasons Zion is about to make a jump,"All the signs are there and nobody in the national media is paying attention. It's like back in the day when there were no satellites and people didn't know a hurricane was coming(see Isaac's Storm by Erik Larson)...

1. Read Zion's quotes...He seems more mature.. he sounds like he feels overlooked. He probably was a little jealous that he wasn't on that Olympic team. 

2. People overlook how good he was playing down the stretch last year. It seemed like he figured some things out...watch those Phoenix highlights...the one he hunted Durant and completely destroyed the Suns. His confidence is so much higher. 

3. Z has added new moves. I think he used a midrange pull up in maybe 7 games last year? Now it looks like he is going to take 2 a night. 

4. Zion is going to get 3-4 assists a night playing off Hawkins. I am bullish on Hawkins as well. I think the kid is going to be a terror off the bench. I bet we see some of the same 2 man actions Z had with JJ. 

5....Lastly, as always with Z. He seems healthy and somewhat fit. He is starting the season in a good place physically. Imagine how good he might be by March, if he starts the season like last spring Zion..

I am pumped... I can't wait to see it.

It was a surreal experience. Watching him and BI up close, it was better than I ever imagined. Seeing the way Zion moved, dunked, it was poetry in motion

Source (p.8): [https://www.nba.com/gamenotes/pelicans.pdf](https://www.nba.com/gamenotes/pelicans.pdf)

My point is that it's really hard to watch as a fan whenever we get down, it's almost always guaranteed we lose (and comebacks make one of the most thrilling aspects of any sport). We don't know how to rally. It's going to hurt us in playoffs where learning to make up a deficit makes or breaks a team. Obviously I'm not expecting us to win most of games you trail by, but like, c'mon 3/16 when down at half and 0/18 trailing at the fourth makes us look like a lottery team.",NOLAPelicans,62,https://www.reddit.com/r/NOLAPelicans/comments/1bor2p3/this_teams_inability_to_ever_make_a_comeback_when/

2024-04-28,1714267968,Brandon Ingram LENGTHY Discussion =­,"A fellow fan in the same boat as all of you. Frustrated and fed up.



I wanna give 2¢ on Ingram that absolutely nobody asked for.



I get the frustration with him, I really do. Since his return from INJURY, he has seemed to lack aggression, seems out of it, and seems (to many) like he doesnt care. This has been frustrating for me too.



To all the people saying BI doesnt care tho, you really genuinely think that? Where do I start??



1). Being There For His Team: If BI didnt care about his own legacy let alone this series, he woulda never have come back from injury. It was only a season ago that the rest of the team was pissed with BI for not playing through his injury or being willing to even play through some of his injury (ie.: not coming back when feeling anything less than 100%). This year he did that to be there for the team but also in a crucial time when it was needed. Not an excuse for shitty body langue, but also cant put ALL (can put some) of the blame on him considering he def isnt fully recovered. Some of his lack of aggression is def from his fear of getting hurt (some is def frustration with Lu too, which you cant have or show on the court)



2). Proving Doubters Wrong: Its not secret Bi had a shitty outing with Team USA, and its no secret he was frustrated about it. Really since the pelicans suns playoff outing in 2021 where BI played elite and also had a great season, especially the second half of that season, and after his 2022 season which contained some injuries and some lack of aggression, and more importantly a lack of a Pels playoff appearance, a lot of people began to doubt BI as a 1 option (1 option WITH Zion Williamson out) with the lack of ability to lead of team. Combine this with his poor team USA outing, BI has a status to attain and a needing to perform, not only for the sake of the team but for his whole legacy. A lot of people are saying BI doesnt care about the team or losing yet forget that this is the guy who really doesnt do much but hoop or watch hoops, and not only this but solely the fact that people have been doubting him in recent times, BI most definitely sees this return from injury, even if not 100%, as a chance to prove his doubters and haters wrong. On top of this, many have been saying this season due to Zions (return to) elite play and increased high level showings, that the pelicans do not need BI or that he is not an all star caliber player. BI being competitive and wanting to be great is without a doubt playing to prove his haters and these narratives wrong. Now has it shown at all? Absolutely not, there is no way to try and defend it at all or say it hasnt, as BI hasnt shown much aggression nor has he shown any enthusiasm, but to say this is because he doesnt care or doesnt want it is blatantly untrue. 



3). Targeted Defense This Series: The Thunder have made it clear who their target is on defense: Brandon Ingram. Every time Ingram is in, Lu Dort, a high level defender in this league is only in the game, on the court, when BI is, and plays him very physically and aggressively to wear him down. BI definitely needs to put on more weight as he did ago, and needs to be able to adjust to teams scheming like this instead of forcing shots (which has been really weird bc bi was such a good playmaker last season and this reg. season). His body language and frustration is unacceptable, like Willie even said, cant have him forcing shots or plays and the team cant keep force feeding him. My point with this tho is even with his flawed handling of this scheming, the Thunder are placing their defensive focus on him for a reason: bi is a GREAT, all star caliber player. 



Now with all of this being said we have to defend BI subjectively or come up with reasons as to why he isnt playing well (i.e: bi stans ) NO. However, do we say that BI is to completely to blame for this?? Absolutely not. As I mentioned the man wants it, just doesnt always show it, and with the circumstances mentioned above and considering his high level play with New Orleans outside of this horrible stretch, BI hate needs to stop. No I did not say criticisms, as he definitely deserves some of these and I even criticized him (above) myself, but I think there true issues with this team are pretty glaring.

2024-04-11,1712858436,Ringer on Herb 1st team Defense; Zion honorable mention All NBA,"""Its hard to make a statistical argument that warrants Jones over someone like, say, Anthony Davis. But I dont think anyone wreaked more unquantifiable havoc than Herb. You just kinda have to watch the Pelicans and make note of how many opponents offensive sets are unplugged by his hustle, length, and anticipation. He knows whats going to happen before it does, climbs inside his mans jersey, and blows up the play. Nobody ducks under a ball screen or dribble handoff and then recovers to take away (or block) the pull-up jumper faster than Jones. Its almost like he fools shooters into thinking they have enough time and space to get something up. Unfortunately for them, Not on Herb: 

 

When he trails over the screen and refuses to detach himself from the ball handlers hip, Jones can not only offer a solid contest from behind, but also put one of his many superpowers on display, taking away any pass back to the screener.

Jones is dogged on the ball, where he assumes the toughest assignment each and every night. But its exceptional how often he mucks something up from the weak side, drifting off his man and pouncing at the exact right moment.

 There have been literally hundreds of plays like this one where Herb, in some form or fashion, disrupts the opposition. Its amazing.""

2024-02-26,1708918454,Team needs to make a point about Zions lack of free throws,"The team posted a graphic tonight showing that Zion shoots 14.8 shots at the rim to Giannis 14.6 shots, but Zion gets 6.8 FTs a game to Giannis 11.1 FTs. 

We see Zion get absolutely **battered** the large majority of nights. He for sure needs to adopt the tactics players use in todays age to get calls; we cant watch an SGA, Sengun, Jimmy Butler, Demar, etc. get to the line freely while Zion is all but dismissed by the refs 

Id say at least 40% of the job description for the head coach of Zion is to advocate for him with the refs. Hes too humble of a kid for his own good, somebody needs to be willing to take the heat for him every single night. 

Willie *has* gotten techs before, hes even been ejected, but this really is something you have to fight for every night. Constant communication with those zebras, yelling and getting on them over and over, basically threatening for techs night in and night out is completely necessary

In so many words this organization as a whole needs to work to get Zion to the line **significantly** more often, we cant be nice and passive about this going forward.",NOLAPelicans,9,https://www.reddit.com/r/NOLAPelicans/comments/1b07q16/team_needs_to_make_a_point_about_zions_lack_of/

2024-03-05,1709646721,Herb Stats per Athletic. TLDR - He's good!," He made a total of 34 3-pointers in four seasons at Alabama, including just one his entire junior season.  Jones shot just 34 percent from 3 as a rookie, then dipped to 33 percent during [a difficult sophomore campaign](https://theathletic.com/4296108/2023/03/10/nba-pelicans-herb-jones/)  

 Hes up to 42.9 percent from 3 this season. Since Jan. 1, hes making a scorching 53.6 percent of his 3s, the top mark among players with at least 75 attempts over that span. If he keeps up his current pace, Jones is set to join [Jrue Holiday](https://theathletic.com/nba/player/jrue-holiday-F5hrjac6YFBzx2nI/) and DeMarcus Cousins as the only players in Pelicans history with at least 100 3-pointers, 75 steals and 50 blocks in the same season. 

 Jones leads the Pelicans with 216 points in transition this season, well ahead of second-place [Zion Williamson](https://theathletic.com/nba/player/zion-williamson-l6xjgWmi8X4OMdjm/) (167). 

 Since Jan. 1, the Pels have outscored opponents by 187 points with Jones on the court, the 14th-best single-player mark in the league. Eight of the 14 players above him made the All-Star team this season. Three others ([James Harden](https://theathletic.com/nba/player/james-harden-xj359Qh34ugWFbVp/), [Brook Lopez](https://theathletic.com/nba/player/brook-lopez-k7aWQKAexrC6eVg2/) and [Jarrett Allen](https://theathletic.com/nba/player/jarrett-allen-52csaKyJnLhhpzzw/)) were All-Stars in the past. 

 Because of that, the Pelicans will pay him far less annually ($13 million next season) than defensive-minded contemporaries like [Denver](https://theathletic.com/nba/team/nuggets/)s [Aaron Gordon](https://theathletic.com/nba/player/aaron-gordon-dfSD7VDfYU1PUPtL/) ($22.8 million), Minnesotas [Jaden McDaniels](https://theathletic.com/nba/player/jaden-mcdaniels-LHvrZO9NfNz4FcEt/) ($22.5 million), Houstons [Dillon Brooks](https://theathletic.com/nba/player/dillon-brooks-8nCbv4hpPQdqLjbo/) ($22.2 million), Memphis [Marcus Smart](https://theathletic.com/nba/player/marcus-smart-dGLlEXUh7pIPWXUa/) ($19.9 million), [Oklahoma City](https://theathletic.com/nba/team/thunder/)s Lu Dort ($16.5 million) and others. Not having to pay Jones upwards of $20 million a year gives the Pels more flexibility to build out the rest of the roster and keep other core pieces like Murphy and perhaps [Jose Alvarado](https://theathletic.com/nba/player/jose-alvarado-znyKNsMl10GZNP1k/) once its time for them to get paid.

2024-03-15,1710508508,"Zach Lowe - TM3, Zion. I'm ready for the tough slate and the playoffs. How about you?"," 

## 1. The [New Orleans Pelicans](https://www.espn.com/nba/team/_/name/no/new-orleans-pelicans) (and [Trey Murphy III](https://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/4397688/trey-murphy-iii)) are happening ... right?

The Pelicans' true level of seriousness has yet to be determined. On paper, their case is ironclad. Roaring through the softest part of their schedule has left the Pelicans with the league's fourth-best point differential. They are 10th in offensive efficiency and sixth in defense -- one of four teams in the top 10 in both.

They are 21-13 on the road and 20-17 against teams above .500. And yet accounting for injuries to opponents' stars, the Pelicans' only landmark win of the past two months came on the road against the [LA Clippers](https://www.espn.com/nba/team/_/name/lac/la-clippers) \-- a physical, playoff-style game. In fairness, the Pelicans have dealt with their share of injuries. They also blew out the [Indiana Pacers](https://www.espn.com/nba/team/_/name/ind/indiana-pacers) at home two weeks ago -- a good win.

They had a solid grasp on the No. 5 seed and tons of media attention as they opened a tougher portion of their schedule Wednesday ... and got rolled at home by the [Cleveland Cavaliers](https://www.espn.com/nba/team/_/name/cle/cleveland-cavaliers). The skeptics crowed, recalling New Orleans spotlight pratfall in the in-season tournament semifinals: *This team is interesting, and weird, and sometimes awesome -- but they are not serious people.*

We'll know more soon; the Pelicans face the Clippers on Friday, with games against the [Boston Celtics](https://www.espn.com/nba/team/_/name/bos/boston-celtics), Milwaukee Bucks, [Oklahoma City Thunder](https://www.espn.com/nba/team/_/name/okc/oklahoma-city-thunder), Phoenix Suns, [Miami Heat](https://www.espn.com/nba/team/_/name/mia/miami-heat) and [Orlando Magic](https://www.espn.com/nba/team/_/name/orl/orlando-magic) in the next two weeks.

The Pelicans *are* weird. Even with more time together, the starry trio of [Zion Williamson](https://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/4395628/zion-williamson), [Brandon Ingram](https://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/3913176/brandon-ingram) and [CJ McCollum](https://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/2490149/cj-mccollum) is minus-nine in 658 minutes. The spacing can get clunky.

The coaching staff never seems entirely sure about which center -- [Larry Nance Jr](https://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/2580365/larry-nance-jr). or [Jonas Valanciunas](https://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/6477/jonas-valanciunas) \-- fits better with certain core lineup combinations, or how much (if at all) to shift Williamson to center. There is a gray area between versatility and confusion; the Pelicans live there.

But something real is happening. You don't win on the road and pile up a top-five scoring margin over 65 games by accident. In some of those wins against bad and injury-ravaged teams, the Pelicans rampaged to huge first-quarter leads -- icy statements of supremacy: *We are better than you, and we don't have time for this.*

[Herbert Jones](https://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/4277813/herbert-jones) and Trey Murphy III are the skeleton keys that have unlocked the Pelicans' identity. After a slow start recovering from knee issues, Murphy is up to 37% on an ungodly 10 3s per 36 minutes. Insert him for one of the Pelicans' three stars, and the team sings. Slotting Murphy one pass away from a Williamson isolation puts the defense is in a bind; Murphy is growing comfortable driving by defenders who rush to close out on him:

 

His off-the-bounce game is a little stiff, but it works because of his size and the threat of his jump shot.

The Pelicans often have Murphy set on-ball picks for Williamson, rocket off flare screens from Nance and keep the offense chugging from there:

 

Jones is one of the league's dozen best defenders, and he's shooting 43.5% on 3s. Holy god. If he sustains anything close to 40%, Jones becomes maybe the league's premiere role player. He is in the first year of a [four-year, $53.8 million deal](https://www.espn.com/nba/story/_/id/37941531/herb-jones-stays-pelicans-4-year-54m-deal) that may be the single best non-rookie contract in the league (from the team perspective, anyway).

In 494 minutes with both Jones and Murphy on the floor, the Pelicans are plus-144.

Ingram is attacking with new grit and steeliness. McCollum has migrated toward the 3-point arc to open the paint for Williamson and Ingram. The past month has been the best of Williamson's career on defense. He's even showing signs of life on the defensive glass, long an embarrassing weak spot. That helps the Pelicans' offense too, because Williamson can turn defensive rebounds into stampeding layups:

 

If New Orleans makes the playoffs, its opponents will peck at Williamson's defense at a level he has never seen. It will be relentless. Teams will yank him into one pick-and-roll after another, testing his will to make multiple rotations, trying to exhaust and even humiliate him.

Is he ready? How will the Pelicans respond to postseason adversity? It would be great theater.

2024-05-10,1715353369,[Scotto/Guillory] Brandon Ingram is expected to ask for a near max contract extension this Summer. CJ McCollum unlikely to be traded due to his stable and grown up personality in young Pelicans locker room. Valanciunas and Marshall unlikely to return in free agency. ,"Source: https://hoopshype.com/lists/pelicans-rumors-zion-williamson-brandon-ingram-cj-mccollum-trades-free-agency/

#Brandon Ingram

&gt; Scotto: Let me ask you this: Do you know ballpark-wise what Ingram and his camp would be looking for in an extension as he enters his final season at $36 million?

&gt; Guillory: I think theyd certainly be wanting to swim somewhere near those max waters. Hes still a guy in his mid-20s who is going to be a really good scorer in this league for a long time, a playmaker, and a guy whos had success with this team as the No. 1 option at times when Zions been out. I think there are teams around the league whod be interested in paying him, if not the max, all the way up to the max for the potential he brings as a wing scorer, can make plays off the dribble, is a versatile defender, and is a good locker room guy. I think hes going to have value on the open market. Does it make sense to pay him and Trey Murphy if youre going to maximize Zion? Ive been banging my head against the wall, trying to figure out whats the good Ingram trade. I keep coming back to Cleveland and Atlanta  and I think Miami is another interesting one. Maybe Brooklyn. Im not sure any of these trades make them better.

- 

#CJ McCollum

&gt; Scotto: This is what Ive been told regarding CJ McCollums future. While hes not untouchable, hes viewed as the grown-up in the room for a young Pelicans squad, providing stability on the court and a good locker room presence for the team. I think thats going to be a guy whose name youll hear come up in trade talks, but for those reasons I mentioned, I dont know if they will move him.

&gt; Guillory: I agree with everything you said as far as how much they value him on and off the court. His maturity and perspective, having those previous playoff runs in Portland under his belt and being a President of the NBPA. A guy who they really respect as a voice in that locker room. Hes also a guy, when you mention putting the right pieces around Zion, he broke the franchise record for threes in a season.

-

#Jonas Valanciunas and Naji Marshall

&gt; Scotto: Theres a sense Jonas Valanciunas wont return as a Pelican this offseason in free agency, Im told. Valanciunas essentially split center minutes with Larry Nance Jr. this season and was benched often to close games. When Zion is healthy and playing, Valanciunas occupies the paint and clogs driving lanes for Zion. While hes still a double-double threat, hes not an ideal fit for this roster, and his near double-double production will likely be more valued by other teams on the unrestricted free-agent market.

&gt; Guillory: Id be pretty surprised if he was back because of how they were treating his spot in the rotation late in the season. There were a few times when they didnt play him in the second half and prioritized having space around Zion, and I think theyll want that in a center of the future next to Zion moving forward. There are a lot of valuable traits Valanciunas brings. He shows up every night and played all 82 games and was a really good paint scorer in games where Zion didnt play.

&gt; Guillory: I think Naji Marshall is going to be an interesting character going into the offseason. Theyre pretty much sold that hes leaving because theyve got all these other financial situations going on. Hes going to try and get paid this summer after coming in as an undrafted free agent and former two-way guy. He really proved a lot this season as a defender and played well in that first-round series. He had some teams sniffing around, seeing how much value he had during the trade deadline. There were some people at the playoff games scouting him.",NOLAPelicans,194,https://www.reddit.com/r/NOLAPelicans/comments/1coroo6/scottoguillory_brandon_ingram_is_expected_to_ask/

2024-04-30,1714518953,A brutal decade of false hope ,"I'm not trying to kill the vibe even more surrounding this team but since AD was drafted no other team has had hope more consistently beat out of them. 

-AD drafted, decent rookie year. We Trade for Jrue, Tyreek, Gordon and look like an exciting team that could win now. Proceed to get a load of injuries and only manage to miss the playoffs and then an 8 seed. 

-This 8 seed appearance has that BRUTAL Steph Curry game and collapse and we get swept. 

-New optimism around the team as championship assistant coach Alvin Gentry is signed. 

-We go on to have a massively injury hit season where we miss the playoffs badly. 

-Another season of mediocrity and then we trade for DEMARCUS COUSINS. This creates the best frontcourt the NBA has seen in years, and during a time where big talent was at an all time low we have a massive advantage. We're not that far off the 8 seed either, HOPE AGAIN! 

-We whimper out of the playoff race with AD and Boogies debut game setting the tone for what was an insanely underwhelming end to the season. 

-Thats okay, we just need an off season to get it together and then next year this Duo will wreck the league! Optimism 

-AD and Demarcus lead us to a .500 record 1/3 into the season... Disappointed again. 

-BUT WAIT AD AND BOOGIE ARE COOKING AND WE GO ON A WIN STREAK. THINGS ARE FINALLY CLICKING 

-Boogie ruptured Achilles. The most brutal moment in recent franchise history. Changes the entire trajectory of the franchise. 

-BUT WAIT, we aquire the goat Niko Mirotic and rally at the end of the season. 

-SWEEP A PLAYOFF SERIES IN THE BEST MOMENT IN RECENT FRANCHISE HISTORY! Lose to the warriors next but we steal a game of the greatest team ever assembled! 

-off season a mixed bag but we don't commit to a washed boogie and get randle on a steal contact. 

-4-0 start to the season AD in MVP talks what a time!!!! We look like a top 5 seed in the west. Randle looks like a steal! 

-injruies inconsistency, we are mid and the dreaded AD TRADE REQUEST. LOW POINT 

-but wait this kicks ownership into gear. We finally make the changes we need and Gale Benson is committed to the team. We give the Lakers the finger at the trade deadline. After a weird end to the season we fire Demps &amp; get best in class shooting / medical staff 

-WE GET THE NUMBER ONE PICK AND THE MOST HYPED PROSPECT SINCE LEBRON 


-WE NAIL THE AD TRADE 

-Looks like we have a team that could compete TODAY and in the future. Jrue x Zion x Ingram x Zo Energy around the franchise shifts and this looks like the best rebuild ever. Pre season looks amazing. NAW &amp; Hayes go off in summer league. 

-zion injury. Momentum ruined 

-we are garbage and go on a crazy losing streak 

-FINALLY ZION IS BACK AND LOOKS GOOD. WE HAVE SOME MOMENTUM 

-Global Pandemic 

-BUT WAIT THE BUBBLE IS HERE AND THERE ARE RULES THAT SEEM TO REALLY FAVOUR US TO MAKE THE PLAYOFFS. WE GET BUBBLE OPENER VS JAZZ 

-Zion looks out of shape, we lose and drop a bubble stinker even tho Adam Silver was begging for us to make the playoffs. 

-New season, New coach (SVG), Steven Adams, healthy Zion! BI was an all-star last year. We are back! 

-mid season with blown leads and no real hope when it comes to making the playoffs. Zion end of season Injury. 

-SVG gone, weird trades with Zo and for Graham. Jonas traded for a steal. Inexperienced coach in Willie signed. Weird times. 

-Zion misses ENTIRE SEASON. Looks like it's going to be brutal. 

-Start the season ass, another wasted year. 

-Emergence of HERB, TM3, Jose and a late play in push omg!! 

-unbelivable vibes, we trade for CJ, make the playoffs and we push last years runners up to 6. The blender was rocking. Nola is everyone's favorite team, Green is everyone's favorite coach. All we need is Zion.

-ZION IS IN SHAPE FOR PRE SEASON 

-WE START NEXT SEASON SO WELL AND MEET EVERYONE'S EXPECTATIONS. Everyone remembers that suns game and holding the 1 seed. Hope might be the best it's ever been. 

-Zion hamstring Injury when he was playing like an MVP kills our whole season. 

-End of season collapse with Play in loss to a okc team that started their rebuild when we did. 

-ALL WE NEED IS TO BE HEALTHY AGAIN! 

-WE ARE FINALLY HEALTHY 

-zion not in shape 

-ZION GETS IN SHAPE MID SEASON 

Weird up and down season which finally seems to be headed to 50 wins and with us becoming the competitive dark horse team we could've been since 2020, playing our best ball going into the playoffs. effort on both ends. Going in to the final game of the season optimism is HIGH. 

-Choke the 6 seed 

-Zion play in hammy. 

-Sweep 


This post took so much longer than I thought it would before I started typing it. Just an absolutely brutal decade.

2024-07-14,1720954389,"I'm a ""casual"" who spent the last couple days watching Hawks games where Trae was out. AMA","DJM takes: 
I can see I'm going to be frustrated by the inefficiency at times. 

Lots of early shot clock no pass 3s.  At least he gets them up and are not well contested.

He very much has a heat check mindset.  If he hits one he is coming back for more.

He is really good at not fouling.  He isn't usually a physical defender but he can at times.  

He goes for lots of steals and has exceptionally active hands but I don't think when he gambles and misses it costs his team.  

If he ends up defending a bigger guy they usually get what they are looking for.  

He had some really impressive chase down blocks and in general plays with a lot of effort. 

If people say he can't play with BI because they both like the mid range they haven't watched him play.  They have completely different ways to get to that shot.  I would say DJM gets to his shots with much less effort and the resulting shot is a lot cleaner look.  He doesn't hit them at the same percentage though.  

He probably doesn't get talked about enough for his passing.  Usually very sharp and has a wide range of different deliveries. 

He doesn't stand around and watch the ball when it's in the air.  He tries really hard to put a body on someone or get in a position for a rebound.  

I'm curious to see what it's like with a lot more talent around him.  CJ, Trey, and Herb are going to feast in the corners and I'm excited for two man games with Zion. He can actually hit the roll man. I think Zion is going to convert at a much higher rate than Capella.",NOLAPelicans,12,https://www.reddit.com/r/NOLAPelicans/comments/1e2zh76/im_a_casual_who_spent_the_last_couple_days/

2023-12-06,1701872701,Zion/Barkley,"I'm sure everyone knows by now about the TNT squad trashing Zion over his weight and being out of shape. They were insinuating that Zion lack of scoring Monday night was due to his basketball shape.

Obviously...they don't watch every game like we do...but I couldn't disagree more. I was impressed with Zion against the Kings. I thought he played well defensively. Sure...there were some miscues. But overall...I thought Z was fine defensively.

What was more impressive to me was his unselfish play and deference to others offensively. He realized early that the Kings were going to smother him...so he made plays for others and let BI shine. He looked legit happy for BI and excited that the team won.

I get so tired of this narrative in the national media that Zion wants out of NOLA. Or...Zion and BI can't work together. He seems happy here to me...and think he realizes he doesn't have to carry the heavy load every night because the team is so deep.",NOLAPelicans,76,https://www.reddit.com/r/NOLAPelicans/comments/18c5292/zionbarkley/

I don't want to forget about Jose Alvarado and CJ, who both played incredibly too. 5 threes for Alvarado was impressive, and he played well, and CJ with i believe 31 also played incredibly.

Also, 3 game lead for Southwest Division title which they have not won since 2008","We rarely talk about winning the division in here, but this has not occurred in more than15 years.  Raising a banner would be sweet since this hasn't been done since CP3/West and never done by AD. 

This will be the second consecutive winning season once they wipe the floor with the Nets this week.  This is a welcome development we all could get used to. 

As per the schedule, some wise person on here said going 3-1 would be huge next week, and I agree.  Winning against the Nets could set the tone for a possible Florida split.  A long trip to Detroit to end should be fine.  The 6 game homestand to follow only has one lottery team at the end (Spurs).  This is the stretch that I want to see.  After that, only the crummy Blazers remain with no playoff consequence/seeding on the line. 

The road to 50 wins is there and getting closer.  But looking at that schedule evidences a gauntlet that will prepare them for the playoffs.  Getting the 4 seed will be tough, but staying out the play in seems a goal we all sought prior to the season and seems attainable.

We're not just some mid team in a small market town doomed to perpetual play-in heart breaks and Zion injuries. We're the deepest, stacked team in the league. We were the undisputed #1 last seed last year when healthy. Zion is a force of nature, BI is a slim reaper, Herb Jones is basically DPOY even though ESPN media won't recognize it, CJ is our experienced veteran leader, and JV is JV. And that all leads to today--today we play the #1 seed on national television. Everybody has been sleeping on us the whole dang season, making fat jokes about Zion, etc. When we beat the Clippers, we'll show the league that we are here to make a serious playoff run, all the way. No more sleeping, no more disrespect.

The Clippers are a little overrated anyway. Does anyone really think they're the #1 Seed in the West? I don't. We're 10-2 against them in our last 12 games. Go check their sub to see they're afraid of us. They know why, Pels stacked...

CJ shouldn't be closing games...especially in the playoffs. He's choked in the clutch throughout his career. This doesn't mean CJ isn't a valuable piece to this team.

He's a calm presence and often stops momentum with big shots when opposing teams go on a run. For 3-3/4 quarters...CJ is valuable. But the final 3-4 minutes of the game...he needs to be on the bench.",NOLAPelicans,18,https://www.reddit.com/r/NOLAPelicans/comments/1bg8am3/credit_to_willie_green/

2024-02-26,1708954496,Pelicans have the worst record against the sub .500 teams amongst the top 11 teams (including Jazz) in the West with a record of 17-9.,"[https://www.espn.com/nba/standings/\_/view/expanded](https://www.espn.com/nba/standings/_/view/expanded)

Pelicans are 17-15 against teams who are over .500 which ranks 5th in the West and 17-9 against sub .500 teams which ranks 11th in the West. 

2 losses against Grizzlies (the total point difference in two games is 3)

2 losses against Rockets (the total point difference in two games is 5)

2 losses against Jazz (the total point difference in two games is 7)

2 losses against Bulls (got swept in the season series where Pelicans swept the Bulls last season)

1 loss against Hawks

Yes, these teams are not horrible like the Spurs, Wizards, Pistons but Pelicans have the 7th highest net rating this season and have playoff aspirations. Pelicans need to beat teams like this to avoid the play-ins and seperate themselves from non-playoff teams. These losses gonna sting more at the end of the season. What's the problem?

2024-03-23,1711203587,"It was not the game for Z, and that's ok","You have to give credit to Willy Green's changes through the course of the game. We have destroyed him all season long for his rotations, but the last few games he has been making tough decisions to win games. Even if it means not playing Z, or CJ (which I remember happening a few games back) in the last quarter. 
We haven't seen a lot of JV lately, but last night was the game for him, so he made the adjustments. 
I hope this continues for the rest of the season/playoffs. We have depth, and not every game will be your game. He is recognizing that. Early this season he was ok by losing as long as it was with his big 3s on the court.",NOLAPelicans,18,https://www.reddit.com/r/NOLAPelicans/comments/1bltacu/it_was_not_the_game_for_z_and_thats_ok/

2024-04-18,1713473162,This sub is BI v. Zion now.  And it's WEIRD,"I wonder if Atlanta's is Trae v. Murray. What about old Wiz when it was Wall and Beal?  Raptors with Derozan and Lowry?

People had high expectations this year.  Unfortunately, injuries at the most inopportune time set this squad back.  At first you can see that people have favorite players on the team.  But I think some people are still fans of the team but favor some players over others.  Shit, the way some people talk Karlo will be All NBA.  In all seriousness, this recent stretch of Lakers, poor play and injuries have certainly divided the fan base.  

Tomorrow night is important, but if Zion isn't there and BI doesn't appear to be close to 100%, this season will end before May.  In any event, this will be a landmark offseason for this squad. Their pick in this draft won't amount to anyone that likely will crack the rotation.  The Lakers pick is slotted at 16, which due to this draft is likely the value of a typical 2nd round pick.   There are some free agents and I seriously doubt Gayle is ever going into the tax.  BI and Trey will be eligible for extensions soon.  

The offseason, when it arrives, will test of all of us this summer.  Good luck.  ",NOLAPelicans,159,https://www.reddit.com/r/NOLAPelicans/comments/1c7e4n1/this_sub_is_bi_v_zion_now_and_its_weird/

2024-09-29,1727614422,"Being a Pels fan in Milano, Italy","As we are all waiting for the media day and there's not so much to talk about until tomorrow, I thought it could be funny to share why I'm here and how much I love this fans sub. Don't know wheter it will be interesting, but I think it's at least an unconventional story.

I'm 43, I'm Italian and I live in Milan. Never played basket in my life: as an Italian guy I grew up on bread and soccer. I still love to play soccer but, honestly, most of the time it is a pretty boring game to watch.

Trying to keep a long story as short as I can: I used to follow NBA in the 90s, when all you could get in Italy (for free) was a 30 minute TV show on Saturday during the RS and the pre-recorded Finals. By the way, it was more MJ than NBA. 

After a very very long hiatus, in 2019 my gf introduced me her best friend's bf (a Pistons fan) and something sparked again.

My attention was immediately caught by the Pels for a few different reasons: they were not there in the 90s, which made me very curious about them, they drafted Nicolò Melli and OF COURSE they were starting a new exciting chapter with Zion. Plus, I've never been there, but NOLA looks like the most amazing place. So I started watching them every time I could.

Flash forward, now:
- I got my League Pass and I wake up at 5.40 am to watch every game they play in the night (bless the ""hide results"" features). I think I only missed one game since the 2022 All-Star game, Summer league included.
- I'm an almost 'every dayer' at Locked On Pelicans and feel like Antonio Daniels and Joel Meyers are old friend of mine
- My 4 year old daughter knows most of the roster and loves to sing the 'José José José' anthem
- To my surprise, I got in touch with another Italian Pels fan: he lives in another town, but we managed to have a beer together
- I love the Pels fans community - this sub, the Retro Pels post, the X threads after the game - and feeling a part of it
- I'm planning my first trip to New Orleans (maybe in a couple of years)
- Still nobody around here really knows what I am talking about when I mention the Pelicans =

I don't feel like this is interesting enough for something like an AMA, but I'll be happy to answer every question. In the end, I just wanted to celebrate my love for this team and this community before the new season starts.",NOLAPelicans,27,https://www.reddit.com/r/NOLAPelicans/comments/1fs3obh/being_a_pels_fan_in_milano_italy/

2024-02-28,1709130684,Zion's slow start and current level of play,"I don't think many Pelicans fans realize exactly how well Zion has been playing since he worked himself into shape. His early season out of shape numbers really drag him down, and because the team is trying to keep him healthy he has played reduced minutes, so his per game numbers don't look fantastic either.

But, since November 20th (after his first 10 games), there are 6 players with &gt;27% usage, &gt;25% assist rate, and &gt;62% true shooting.

Those players are Embiid, SGA, Giannis, Jokic, Luka, and Zion.

On a per 100 possession basis there are 5 players averaging 35 points, 8.5 rebounds, and 9 assists in February.

Those players are Jokic, Tatum, Luka, Giannis, and Zion.

Zion is playing at a level among the truly elite offensive players in the league. As his minutes have increased from around 29-30 per game in December-January to 32 per game in February, he is averaging 24-6-6 per game in February. If his minutes increase to around 35 per game in the playoffs and he can keep the same level of play, his per game numbers will look more like the #1 option, all-nba level we know he is capable of.

2024-04-19,1713533816,Zach Lowe put Herb on his 1st Team All Defense ballot,"""The real competition started at that final first-team slot and coalesced around the league's two best perimeter defenders: Jones and White. You cannot go wrong. White has inherited Dwyane Wade's title as the world's best shot-blocking guard. White challenged 3.8 shots per game at the basket. Opponents hit 57.4% in the restricted area when White was the nearest defender. There are centers that would be happy with those numbers.

White reads opposing offenses from one or two steps ahead and can adjust tactics on the fly without any blips of uncertainty. He is the best defender on the league's No. 2 defense.

The advanced metrics love both players. In the end, I was persuaded by Jones's size -- 6-foot-8, compared to White at 6-4 -- and the versatility that enables. (Jones has a 7-foot wingspan.) Jones is skinny, but he can slide across the positional spectrum a bit more easily.

**Opponents averaged only 0.81 points on isolations against Jones -- the 20th-stingiest figure among more than 300 players who defended at least 50 such plays, per Second Spectrum.** (White allowed about one point per possession -- in the middle of the pack.)

J**ones is a little scarier leaping to contest jump shots -- one reason (among many, including luck) the Pels have allowed a lower-than-expected field goal percentage on jumpers for the past two seasons.** White is also surrounded by All-Defensive candidates: Holiday, Tatum and Brown. ([Kristaps Porzingis](https://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/3102531/kristaps-porzingis) and ol' reliable [Al Horford](https://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/3213/al-horford) are very good too.) Jones is ... very much not. **The Pels would be in big trouble without him.""**",NOLAPelicans,13,https://www.reddit.com/r/NOLAPelicans/comments/1c7x38w/zach_lowe_put_herb_on_his_1st_team_all_defense/

2024-06-28,1719618735,Dejounte Murray hype post,"Im a hawks fan, who will root for for nola in the west. Once I heard the trade rumors, I set my mind to root for the team, to which he will be traded.

First of all, I think its the right move that we (the hawks) traded him, since he didnt fit with Trae. What Im gonna say is, that his defense was portrayed better than it actually is. But with Herb, Trey and your other guys, hes in the perfect spot to exploit his defensive capabilities. He will fit just fine defensively and probably be the spurs DJ. 

DJs offense is UNDERRATED. His shotmaking is incredible. I almost watched  every Hawks game. This man can CREATE HIS OWN SHOT. I mean it. His off the dribble pull up game is crazy. Once he gets to his midrange spot, its wraps. He improved his three point shot and shot creation too.

His playmaking abilities are so awesome. When Trae got hurt, he nearly averaged 8/9 per game.

Hes a dog. Took a team friendly deal for a franchise that treated him like shit. Stayed professional (alright lets just ignore his social media outbursts) throughout the time when the first trade rumors were brought up. He can lead a team fr. Great mentor and locker room guy.

Hope this trade made both franchises better.

2024-01-22,1705952146,"[Stein] It was relayed to me in rather strong terms over the weekend that the Pelicans, contrary to one recent report, are not open to fielding offers on defensive ace Herb Jones.","Source: https://marcstein.substack.com/p/more-latest-updates-from-nba-trade

&gt; It was relayed to me in rather strong terms over the weekend that the Pelicans, contrary to one recent report, are not open to fielding offers on defensive ace Herb Jones.

&gt; New Orleans is undeniably facing a fast-approaching contract crunch with Trey Murphy IIII eligible for a rookie scale contract extension in the offseason and, more generally speaking, keeping everyone paid and happy on what might be the league's deepest roster.

&gt; Alleviating that crunch by surrendering Jones, however, does not appear to be a route that the Pelicans have any interest in taking. Jones is in Year 1 of a four-year contract extension worth just under $54 million and has shown an adaptability to play in numerous lineup configurations.

&gt; The Pelicans created a significant measure of financial relief for this season by working their way into the Pascal Siakam trade. The inclusion of Kira Lewis Jr. as part of the trade got New Orleans under the luxury tax and thus resulted in savings of an estimated $18 million alone.

&gt; Yet it's likewise true that the Pelicans face some serious challenges to keep all of their talent after fortifying their Zion Williamson/Brandon Ingram/CJ McCollum core by hitting on a string of recent draftees & from Murphy (No. 17 in 2021) to Jones (No. 35 in 2021) to Dyson Daniels (No. 8 in 2022) to flammable rookie Jordan Hawkins (No. 14 in 2023).

&gt; Another looming challenge is the forthcoming free agency of veteran center Jonas Valanciunas, who continues to be a valued on- and off-court contributor in the Pelicans orbit at age 31 while playing on an expiring $15.4 million deal.",NOLAPelicans,32,https://www.reddit.com/r/NOLAPelicans/comments/19d45r4/stein_it_was_relayed_to_me_in_rather_strong_terms/

Zion is probably done for the ""season"". The only silver lining here is...the front office should have seen enough to know who we need to build the future around.

Build around Zion/Herb/Trey/Jose. Everyone else is tradeable. Trade BI for a serviceable big and hopefully a decent starting PG. Get rid of Larry Nance immediately. I don't care if we get nothing in return for Larry...just get him the fuck outta here.

Ironically, he was our best player this entire series.
I'll be sad to see him go but he deserves to be on a team that knows how to utilise him run by a serious organisation and smarter coaches than what he's had to deal with.
