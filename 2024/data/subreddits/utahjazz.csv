2023-12-16,1702716127,Some thoughts on the trade rumors that have sparked.,"Obviously this post could age really poorly since Danny Ainge loves throwing curveballs but I'm a believer in what he does. To start: Lauri isn't being moved, neither is Keyonte, Ochai, Kessler or Hendricks but for different reasons and for all of them there would have to be an overpay to get them for sure. Not necessarily ""untouchable"" just really unlikely they are included in a deal. 

Collins: That contract is huge and tough to trade but I could totally see what they were trying to do when moving for it. Had to spend a certain amount under the new Collective Bargaining Agreement and  realistically Rudy gay wasn't getting you anything. Collins is younger, shoots the ball better and has the tools to simply be better, some teams might want him but I don't think you're gonna get much of an upgrade unless you're lucky, just definitely better than what Rudy Gay would've gotten you that's for sure. I think it's a &gt;50% chance he's moved though with how these rumors sound and how good Taylor has been. 

Olynyk: I think trading him would end up resulting in quite the loss since he is the swiss army knife guy and keeps the ball moving+shoots it well. If they do end up moving him though he might grab something of value for the long term.. but I think there's a smaller chance he gets moved especially with the Collins rumor and being on the last year of the deal Utah has options with him. 

Sexton: I don't think he's being moved personally, I think he's improving and fights way too hard not to have the chance for the longer term. I know a lot of people envision him as the 6 man and that's exactly what I see. If he does get moved though I think they'd get a ""surprising"" return from him, once again though I think this is just really unlikely despite the rumors. There are a ton of fans around the league who would love to have Colin and I'm hoping front offices feel the same way and would be willing to overpay. 

Clarkson: Definitely think they're shopping him and trying to get something from him, have no clue what but I'd assume they want either Simone or Ochai to take his spot in the lineup in that Danny Green spurs style fit. Despite the poor play I would really miss him but if it's for the benefit of the team I'd be happy to take the deal. 

Talen: the most 50/50 dude on the team right now, has 5 minutes of great play followed by 5 minutes of play that's negative for the team. With his contract expiring I think it's more than likely he does get moved even if it's just for nothing but a salary match. Though ideally between him and Clarkson Utah can bring back a playmaker and mentor for Key, this point has been made a million times though and I'm sure it's something management is actively looking at. 

Samanic: Not even sure about him, he's kinda the depths of the roster and even though he shows flashes he's borderline impossible to move. 

Simone: would be dumb to trade him with how well he's playing now but if he is moved it'd probably be an overpay. Not counting him as untouchable though because the chances of him being moved are still higher than the chances of the guys like Kessler or Lauri 

Sensabaugh: I don't know why you trade him or what team comes begging but I mean he's definitely not as untouchable as the other rookies. His development will be long so we don't know what he is capable of yet. He's been spotty in his time with the Stars though but there are flashes. 

Dunn/Yurt: probably won't be moved unless they're needed to match a salary or something of the sort but they are useful backups and I'm expecting them to stay around. I guess specifically I could see Yurt moved because Micah Potter has made some crazy strides in the G League and depending on how they feel about him it might push the Jazz into moving Omer. 

Overall yeah something is going to happen, I wouldn't be shocked to see Utah go after another bad contract to match deals, I've seen Hayward mentioned which sounds gross but on paper he is multi positional and could just help the young guys by moving the ball.. before he walks in free agency lol. As for other bad contracts I'm not sure if Utah would wanna drop in as a 3rd team in a Miami deal and grab Duncan Robinson but I also have heard that one by some fans and don't entirely hate it, he's played much better this year. As for guys like Ben Simmons I just don't know if it happens let alone why Utah would do it unless obviously Brooklyn gives up a pick or more. 

As for upgrade pickups, Tony Jones has mentioned Tyus Jones multiple times and I love the potential fit as a playmaker. I'm not sure if Monte Morris is still an option but he'd be that kinda guy as well. I'm not expecting a star to become available let alone Utah to go after one and I'm pretty low on the idea of Zach Lavine unless you can put him on a short leash somehow and ""play to his strengths"" which probably isn't reasonable, part of me doesn't completely hate the idea as much as everyone else because Will Hardy does a decent job squeezing skill out of guys but Zach along with other guys would be tough. Personal picks though, I'd love to somehow get DeAndre Hunter or OG Anunoby but those aren't the most realistic odds right now. 

I'd hope the Jazz land picks even if it's 2nd rounders if they do have to go down in quality, that being said I don't think the trades will be blatant tank moves and at best they'd just be clearing the logjams. 
The real win will be getting Hendricks mins for good and not having to rely on injury for it and slowly opening the door for Brice to get time as well. As for getting picks again, I know 2nd rounders aren't as valuable as firsts of course but having 2nds allows you to make moves for those lower end role players who could fit needs you're missing so you don't have to overpay. 

Would love to hear realistic deals or dream deals though to build up some optimism for trade season.",UtahJazz,16,https://www.reddit.com/r/UtahJazz/comments/18jn1fb/some_thoughts_on_the_trade_rumors_that_have/

2024-08-10,1723262692,"After a Detailed Analysis of Ainge's offseason moves, I reveal his secret plan... To get Jokic?","In all seriousness, I don't think that's actually what's happening here. However, I hope this is a lighthearted look at our offseason moves and what it might reflect about the team's future plans. 

**Major Offseason Moves:**

Lauri Extension: Bumps his salary this season to 42 million and locks him into a 4-year max extension. Since he signed this Aug 7th it could almost be considered a 5-year extension with no player option. 

(Speculation: Lauri wants to be in Utah long term since he made himself unable to be traded this season and did not take a player option which would have made him a FA in 2028 at 31.)

Rookies: Drafted Cody Williams, Isaiah Collier, and Kyle Filipowski. Each of them could be considered value picks with Cody mocked in the 5-8 range, Isaiah as a 15-20 pick, and Kyle as a first-rounder.

(Speculation: This will be a developmental season with most of the top minutes on the team being taken up by players on rookie contracts.)

Drew Eubanks: The FA center was signed to a 2-year 10 million dollar contract. An undersized center, Eubanks will likely slide into a position where there are 2 other established players (Kessler and Collins), and a rookie (Filipowski), competing for minutes.

(Speculation: The Front Office expects to trade Kessler or Collins sometime before the trade deadline.)

Svi Mykhailiuk: The Celtic wing was signed to a 4-year 15 million dollar contract. Tony Jones reports he has a chance to earn minutes at either wing spot.

**The Real Stuff:**

With that overview of these moves done, let's get deeper into some hidden connections and speculations about Ainge's plans beyond the opening-day roster.

The Jazz now have a 16-person roster. This includes 4 centers (yikes), 4 wings, and 8 guards. There are 2 roster spots technically available since we have 3 two-way players. The average player age is 24.4 years old, with the oldest player being Clarkson at 32.

The Jazz have about 8.5 million in cap space. With them likely using the Bi-annual exception on Svi, they still have the full 12.8 million Mid-Level exception, and two trade exceptions worth 3 and 6.5 million respectively. 

Speaking of Svi, there has been some speculation that he was signed because he shares an agent with Lauri. The 15 million deal to Svi could be seen as an easy way to win favor with this agent and his other clients.  

This is an interesting guess until we see that Lauri, Svi, and Tony Snell are the only clients of this agent under an active NBA contract. Alternatively, this could be a condition negotiated by Lauri's agent in exchange for him not requesting an option on his extension. 

Since we're looking at agents, let's look at the other confusing FA signing, Eubanks. His agent is from Excel Sports Management, one of the larger NBA agencies. 

The agency, which has an awful website btw, represents many NBA players including Jamal Murray, Khris Middleton, Ingram, Isaac Okoro, and John Collins, who can all hit the FA market within the next year. It also includes 3 time MVP Nikola Jokic and recent number 1 overall pick Cade Cunningham. In an odd connection, they also represent Westbrook, whom the Jazz helped to facilitate his move to Denver from LA. 

(Speculation: The Jazz have made several moves in favor of Excel in anticipation of several of their clients hitting FA next offseason including players Lauri's age in Ingram and Murray. This may also be in anticipation of the Jazz planning to trade Collins or encouraging him to decline his option and enter FA next summer.)

**Conclusions:**

Warm: Jazz trade Collins by the trade deadline.

Hot: Jazz sign Ingram/Murray to a 30-40 million per year deal next offseason.

2023-11-09,1699537617,Early season fans,"So far this season (9 games in) I have enjoyed reading posts and posting in the GameDay threads. After watching last night's game (Pacers) I was surfing the r/UtahJazz posts and noticed an article about THT and why he thinks we should believe in him. 

Now I've read all the comments about him and Sexton and the rest of the Utah Jazz players and staff. Apparently, some of the players read these posts too. It got me to thinking about some of the things I've read and frankly, some of my own posts.

   Coaches and players know what bad losses feel like, if you've ever coached a youth sport, you know.  The fans(parents,families) really lose faith quickly. Second guessing coaches, players, the organization as a whole. They begin shouting at refs, expressing their negative opinions on the sidelines etc .. Not a great environment for the players, or any of the participants for that matter. 

I'm seeing a lot of that behavior this season with our favorite team. The amount of negative comments about THT, Sexton, Clarkson,just about every member of the team is just not good.  If the players read these comments, it's not good at all. 

Some of the best teams start with the worst records. As you build, the winning usually takes care of itself.  The atmosphere you build becomes the culture, culture attracts talent, talent affects winning, and the winning feeds the culture. 

Yeah, we've seen some poor basketball this season and I can empathize with the other fans about those losses but let's not tear the team apart from the inside out. Let's respect the players, coaches and staff and support them with positivity.

His shooting, play making and handles seem elite at the G-League level and Im really curious how his play translates to the NBA.

I was wondering about his contract since hes on a two way and a RFA this year. If the Jazz were to commit to him long term could that two way be converted to a regular contract during free agency or would his current contract complicate that?

2024-01-04,1704409172,2023 Mistakes,"The recent success of the Jazz has me reflecting on the mistakes to start the season, so I'm giving a shout-out to Hardy and the coaches for fixing these mistakes.

Dunn is the only PG on the roster. THT, Sexton, Clarkson, and even Keyonte are better playing off a true PG like Dunn.

A SF is necessary. The 3 guard lineups are trash. A legit SF like Simone needs minutes. 

Defense &gt; Offense  Playing the better defensive players has made a huge difference at the start of the games. No longer are the Jazz down 20 entering the 2nd quarter.

The Zone.  Switching to zone was brilliant. The Jazz are undersized. Kessler is the only legit big man in the rotation. Allowing him to stay close to the rim is huge. 

Clarkson is a 6th man. He just seems to know how to come into a game and affect things. I would guess he is very observant to start the game and picks up on things from the bench/ listening to coaches talk 

Keyonte. He was asked to do too much. Not only being a rookie, but playing a new position. He has shown amazing passing ability, but his decision making and shooting aren't there yet.

- Sounds like youth development is the focus this year. Although, I still have no idea what that looks like in actuality. I personally think the team still has too many veterans needing to play for this to be really possible. Clarkson and Sexton both likely get 25 minutes a night, Lauri will play 32-35, Collins at least 25 etc. I also personally think that means the team is once again back in the 8-10 draft pick purgatory. Wouldve liked to see a reporter ask a more direct question about the direction and plan of the team. 

- Ainge and Zanik dodged the hell out of the big game hunting question. Ainge (despite it being his own quote) made Zanik answer it. Then Zanik tried to claim we all misquoted it or blew it out of proportion. I understand that it takes two to tango in a trade, but their response to this was a little laughable and lacked accountability.

Historically draftees are not very impactful until their 3rd season (occasionally impactful in their 2nd season). The just picked rooks will be heading into their 3rd season, Flagg going into his 2nd, Dybantsa/Boozer going into their rookie years. 

What is supposed to happen next at this point of the process? Lauri would be 29, the next closest in age would be Keyonte/Hendricks at 22. Is the pro ""tank with Lauri"" crowd that high on the kids to assume that roster would make some playoff noise? Or is this a ""push the big game hunting can down the road"" idea?

He's good enough to post up guys like Naz Reid.

It's also insane how many times the guards miss Kessler on the roll. He could literally dunk or layup 5 easy shots a game. I think more involvement in the offense would help his confidence.

2023-11-15,1700037244,"While the Jazz got the win, Sensabaugh, Hendricks and the SLC Stars got dominated by the Stockton Kings 142-99 (Late Recap)","Obviously my attention was on the Jazz who got a needed win but I went back and took a dive into the Stars tonight, didn't watch the full game but saw a handful of plays and the full highlights which were laughable, if anyone did watch this definitely place some input in here though. 

The Kings absolutely dominated, SLC had barely any momentum, they had a small run in the 4th to cut the lead from 42 to 32 then fell off again. Kings have semi recognizable names like the wing Jeremy Lamb, rookie Colby Jones, Skal Labissiere and Jaylen Nowell. They played with a very high tempo though and had a team total of 54/96 from the field vs the Stars' 32/80. 

Juzang returned to the Stars and went 4/10 shooting with 13 points, 3 boards and a block, hit two smooth looking threes and had a nice reverse lay in late game. He has a deep bag and makes some good decisions, he's got size and has been within the Jazz organization for awhile so it's nice to see him always improving.

Brice Sensabaugh had his first rough night with 7 points, 2 for 9 shooting, 1/5 from 3 and was a team low -34. He did have 10 boards and I can't find footage of a single one but the number does look nice on paper.. not trying to excuse a bad night by any means but don't take too much substance out of these numbers, it felt like the focus was on getting other guys involved from what I've seen. 

Taylor Hendricks went 3/6, 2/5 from downtown, had a turnover that I saw that was just a poor mistake and pretty common for him on offense, but it just didn't look like they were running through him at all out there, he did throw a couple nice passes and got 3 assists and 3 boards, went -15 which was 2nd best of the main rotation behind Juzang's -10 (Keshawn Justice and Karolis Lukosiunas barely played). I didn't see a lot of confidence in any play from him tonight but I still think him and Brice will bounce back just fine. 

I feel like I have to mention Micah Potter, had 14pts, went 5/10 and 2/6 from 3, he's streaky but he makes so many good decisions, just tough for him to find a spot on the Jazz with the depth. He did have 5 turnovers though.. 

Not really much else to say, I think Taylor and Brice are still on pace to be back on the Jazz roster sooner than later. Last game Brice Dominated the offensive end and Taylor dominated the defensive end, when they're feeling it they both give the Stars a massive boost. Not too discouraged by this one though.",UtahJazz,5,https://www.reddit.com/r/UtahJazz/comments/17vp9iy/while_the_jazz_got_the_win_sensabaugh_hendricks/
2023-11-09,1699502122,Ochai Agbaji propaganda post,"Edit: wanna add to this that I'm not just trying to look for positives to look for positives, it was a rough night and this 5 game losing streak has really kicked our ass and perspective on the season. 

I'm a hardcore Ochai defender, also a Taylor Hendricks defender as he was my man going into draft night, but a reason I like these guys so much is their defensive capabilities and overall effort in every aspect of the game. 

To get straight into it, his effort on defense goes way overlooked, tonight he did a phenomenal job staying with his man while Keyonte and Clarkson struggled to guard especially late. He had a killer chase down block on Mathurin which Utah had to challenge to even get it to count. On the offensive end he made some really huge passes and he's extremely unselfish, he had a play where they kicked it to him in the corner and he had a pacer defender closing in quick, rather than taking the shot he kicks it to the opposing wing to THT who would make a nice pass to Collins for the open three on the other corner. 

He doesnt have great handles, that's no secret, but he also knows when to pass the ball and just made the right reads all night. I wanna talk about a play in the Chicago game where we got smacked, but Chicago had a fast break where Lavine got the trailing pass and Ochai once again got the recovery chase down block, then Chicago saved it passing it back to Coby white who was on the opposing wing and Ochai beat everyone back for the recovery contest which still resulted in an open 3 from a lack of help. He also was the 2nd best defensive option on DeRozan behind Markkanen and Chicago didn't even get DeMar the ball much at all when Ochai was on him. Tonight it was the same way on every defensive possession, Indiana attacked Keyonte, Sexton, THT and Clarkson but rarely Ochai (someone should break these ones down a bit better though because half of the plays I couldn't even tell who was supposed to be guarding too, just looked awful as a team). 

Ochai tonight goes 1-3 from the field, 3 shots is it, and his first was in the 2nd half, I personally think you gotta get him some shots early so he can get in rhythm then get him some shot attempts late. Even an extra two attempts goes a long way for him tonight. On the negatives he had a few Turnovers but so did everyone else it seemed. He also gets 4 boards and like Kris Dunn Ochai really puts in the work to get his rebounds. 

My whole takeaway with him is that the team just looks so much better when he's on the floor and he's exactly the guy Utah needed in their last two playoff series. I think you keep him in that starting lineup and you let him develop the same way you let Keyonte develop, except I feel like his development is going to lead you to closer games, more wins and just an overall more bearable experience to watch. 

We still have a long way to go this season and obviously it looks even more bleak than it did a few days ago, but there are things that could flip the switch for us and Ochai is one of them. To cap it off, I can't wait until Hendricks is ready for NBA action because I feel the same way about him, although he's going to make a lot of rookie mistakes. Hope things go well for the team as a whole though figured I'd just spread my Ochai agenda because I have noticed his impact like crazy.",UtahJazz,9,https://www.reddit.com/r/UtahJazz/comments/17r4fky/ochai_agbaji_propaganda_post/

2024-10-12,1728764591,"If the Jazz are to surpass expectations, it'll be because of Keyonte George's progression.","Lots of talk on here and on twitter surrounding the Jazz' prospects this season. Sneaky play-in threat, a team that's too good to be bottom 3 odds, a team that should have a bottom 3 record. Opinions run the gamut.

I could see it going either way although I have to remind everyone to not overreact to preseason...it's called preseason for a reason. Their roster on paper is clearly above the absolute bottom of the league. It's young though, and young teams tend to lose and they are in the tougher conference. If they do win at a competitive rate, it would tell us that the last 2-3 years of moves have built a foundation we can really win with in the future.

On Thursday, we saw the blueprint of what could be a competitive team could be. Walker Kessler had his best game of preseason and played much more like what we saw in his rookie year. I honestly think he can play even better, but what we saw was a high activity level, engagement, and playing with far more urgency and force. Playing stronger at the rim, verticality, attacking the offensive boards, and more urgency with his drop responsibilities defensively. He was lazy defensively the first two games and he was weak around the rim. He's gotta play the way he did on Thursday consistently. If he does, this team can at least hold their heads above water defensively. They are unlikely to be good defensively, let's be frank, but they can be salvageable with that kind of performance from Walker.

We already know what Lauri and Sexton can bring to the table. Cody Williams, Taylor Hendricks, Isaiah Collier are all very talented young role players. The strengths/weaknesses that they had displayed in college and for Taylor, last season, are still essentially what they've displayed in preseason. Taylor played good defense overall against Dallas. He isn't perfect but with the responsibilities he has on his shoulders, he's showing us there's a high ceiling defensively, one where he can defend 1-4 capably. If he shows he can handle himself well against opponent's best offensive talent, that allows the Jazz to be able to find easier matchups for George and Sexton.

If the Jazz are going to compete this season, it will be because Keyonte George took a substantial step forward in his play. He's the PG. He's the team's QB. And they need him to be able to efficiently set up the offense, make the right reads, make the right decisions with the appropriate timing as a passer, and shoot better from the outside than he did as a rookie as well as be more cerebral as a finisher and improve his floater. I think we've all seen progress this preseason. It hasn't been perfect, but the shotmaking is there.

The PG play has been adequate. The one thing we've really seen progress with is the fact he's playing far more confident basketball, more assured in what he wants to achieve and reading defenses more effectively. There's more maturity in his game right now, but his processing/decision making is still certainly not at the level yet we'd want it to be at his peak, which is to be expected. He's still young and developing as a point, but because of the importance of that position to any team's success, that development is going to ultimately sink or swim this Jazz team this year. There's no replacement this season....he has the reigns. We'll see just how much of a step forward he takes. I don't expect greatness but if he can be somewhere around league average in his play than the Jazz offense has the weapons to be effective. It'd also mean he's doing a better job getting Kessler involved offensively, which is what we're going to need to see to get the most out of him as a starter.

Defensively we're seeing Keyonte playing with more force but still struggling with screens. His off ball defense has been better, which was a massive problem last season. He's playing with more engagement defensively. I don't expect the world from him defensively, just can't be a liability. Been a bit of a mixed bag I'd say, but he was better in the Mavs game.

This season's results from a W/L perspective and frankly this season from a long term perpsective really does hinge on Keyonte George. Is he this team's future at PG? We'll have a decent idea of that this season. He is the most important player for the Jazz this year. I'm a fan of winning, so if the Jazz win, and it's because he has taken a step forward, we can't complain about that.

He is non athletic and slow on offense and defense. Our defense is bad enough already. 

I'd obviously rather have Stephon Castle as the resident Castle fanboy. Great primary defender who can defend 1-4, good ball handling, good finishing, good playmaking, iffy shooting. Our lineup is 5 out so we can handle having an iffy shooter out there.

Id rather take Cody Williams, id rather take ron Holland, hell id rather take Zach edey just for the potential alone. (Jokic came into the league slow and bad defender with a bad 3 pt shot too, and edey is more athletic.) I'd love clingan but he's going at 3 now in the mock.

But now it feels like everyone is thinking we should have settled for trying to be happy with a play in team that probably wasn't even going to be able to make it. 

I read a comment that was like ""glad we got to start watching every game for free when we started tanking"" and thought about what a first world problem that was and how embarrassed I was that someone would be that upset.  Many people now get to watch every game for free when every other fan base has to pay atleast $150 for the same opportunity. 

Its a building process, it takes time.  If you don't enjoy watching the process take place and the development happen for free, then maybe you should take a break for a couple of seasons and come back when the bandwagon is a little more comfy for ya, because ownership has made it pretty obvious they aren't happy with settling for 1st round exits or mediocre feel good seasons where we try to push for the play-in.  For me, I'm fine watching them build up to a great team that in 3 years I'll still be able to watch for free and enjoying the journey.

2024-04-04,1712245509,Projecting Keyonte George Based on Rookie and College Seasons,"There has been a lot of optimism surrounding Keyonte this season, at times to the point of being wildly overblown. What should we expect Keyonte to be going forward based on players that had statistically similar rookie and college seasons? I grabbed the last 12 seasons of rookies years to compare to Keyontes, and used college seasons to determine if the similar rookie year should be used as a projection.

Keyonte is shooting 38/33/85 for the season, not dissimilar to his 42/34/79 college season. This seems to be not just a ""rookie slump, but rather where his shooting generally is based on his shot diet and ability. Other stats I found valuable to compare were ast/to as I believe it is a signal of basketball IQ, and stocks/36 because it indicates general defensive ability and overall effort (it's easy to give effort on offense, especially when you are the primary ball handler).

From least to most similar imo:

The great college shooters that actually just had rookie adjustments shooting-wise:

Jamal Murray - A 41% 3 point shooter on high volume in college, and much more apt getting to the rim and finishing there (higher functional athleticism, 18 dunks vs 3 for Keyonte) than Keyonte. Now has the benefit of playing next to the best defacto PG in the NBA, which Keyonte will likely never get the luxury of having. Twice as many stocks/36 as keyonte. Not a realistic Keyonte projection.

Devin Booker - A 41% 3 point shooter on high volume in college, and much more able to finish at the rim than Keyonte. Not a realistic Keyonte projection. Would be an extreme outlier development result.

Darius Garland - the small sample size on this one is tricky, but Garland shot 11/23 from 3 (48%) in college and proved that to be the rule and not the exception as he has shot 38% from 3 for his career. This would be a pretty surprising result to me for Keyonte, but not necessarily borderline impossible like the ones above seem to be to me.

Let's actually get into realistic comps:

Zach Lavine - Actually a fairly decent statistical comp for Keyonte, but Lavine is just insanely more athletic than Keyonte which raises the quality of player he is immediately.

Jordan Clarkson - Clarkson was actually a worse shooter than Keyonte, but had double the stocks/36 his rookie year. We'll say this is a possible Keyonte result, but likely Keyonte ends up a better offensive player but worse defensively.

Trey Burke - In college and his rookie year Trey was a better passer/pure PG, and was essentially very similar everywhere else. Keyonte has a couple inches on him and gets to the line far more often.

The truly most realistic projections for Keyonte:

Coby White - most everything is statistically insanely similar here. Keyonte has more assists, but a similar enough ast/to that it may just be due to Keyonte being the one with the ball the most. Coby had a good amount more stocks/36 his rookie year as well. Keyonte with the free throw rate advantage.

Cole Anthony - Cole and Keyonte are almost statistical clones in college, and remained as such their rookie years. The only real difference is Cole had almost double the stocks/36.

(Scoot and Sensabaugh also landed in the similar to Keyonte as rookies category)

Important note: of the actually possible results (less athletic Lavine, Clarkson, Burke, Coby, and Cole) the first one to reach a positive Darko DPM was Coby at about game 320. Playing 75 games a season would put us at the beginning of season 5 to hit 0 DPM if we projected Keyonte on the Coby path, which is pretty poor timing for the ""being a core piece of competing with Lauri"" timeline.

TLDR/conclusion: Coby White/Cole Anthony is the most realistic statistical projection of Keyonte based on college and rookie results.",UtahJazz,35,https://www.reddit.com/r/UtahJazz/comments/1bvqiaf/projecting_keyonte_george_based_on_rookie_and/

2024-02-26,1708970434,Finding the next Jalen Brunson,"This weekend there was some discussion on this subreddit about who the big name might be for the Jazz to pursue this off-season. While the obvious choices came up of good players that would be difficult to shake loose, a comment was made about us ""needing to find the next Jalen Brunson"". I quite like this, so I decided to pursue who Jalen Brunson was before the Knicks, and who else in the league fits that bill.

Not everyone can up their usage and maintain efficiency, but Brunson was able to. I believe this is in part due to his past roles as a team leader, and his mental makeup. I don't have the luxury to know all of the sub context of all these players, but here are the things that were most important to me statistically about Brunson: he was an above average TS efficiency player for the Mavs. He was only 25 in his last year with the Mavs. His usage rate was 22%. His assist % was 24%. He also just happened to be stuck behind one of the best players in the game in Luka Doncic. Let's find players that fit a similar bill.

(Before I start, I have to mention that I think SEXTON IS OUR BRUNSON. Trading him to a team that will play him 30+ mpg (because he's great) would be such a huge mistake for us. The Keyonte attention tends to overshadow how good Sexton has been for us. His per36 stats are insanely similar to Brunsons)

These are players who had played at least 850 minutes last year, had at least a 14.5% ast%, ranged from 19-24% usage, and above 56% TS, that were 26 or younger, which I am calling the Brunson zone: Cole Anthony, Zach Collins, Fultz, Haliburton, Quickley, Sengun, Sexton, and Franz Wagner. Clearly not all of them have been making their Brunson jump, but I would argue that the hit rate is 50% last year (Franz, Sengun, Sexton, and Hali.) I'm not saying that every playing that lands in the Brunson zone will become a great player in the league, but almost every superstar that didn't jump straight into high usage fell into the Brunson zone at some point: SGA, Giannis, Jokic, Haliburton etc.

This year the list is: Deni Avdija, Immanuel Quickley, Austin Reaves, Devin Vassell, Coby White, Jalen Williams. It's difficult to predict who has the Brunson mentality to make a usage jump and maintain efficiency, but these are the players I believe have that chance. (Quickley and Coby have been in the Brunson zone for more than 1 season)

(I looked in the ""Lauri zone"" which is quite similar to the Brunson zone, but with low ast%, and only Naz Reid lived there.)",UtahJazz,8,https://www.reddit.com/r/UtahJazz/comments/1b0o13q/finding_the_next_jalen_brunson/
2024-01-31,1706687801,"SLC Stars lose to the Rip city remix despite a huge game for Brice Sensabaugh, and Brice's development is complicated.","First off before talking about Brice, obviously Taylor Hendricks is likely to be brought back to the Jazz post deadline to assist with the defense and get some development but tonight he just had an awful shooting night, 1-8 from 3, 2-13 from the field, no defensive stats but still played alright on that end and had overall his worst outing after having plenty of great games over the last few weeks. 

Brice Sensabaugh had 21 on 7-13, 2-6 from 3 and 10 boards, 2 steals, and he did turn it over 4 times but overall had a solid night. The thing about Brice is his offensive bag is DEEP. He has a lot of skill and combined with his size, some of those Joe Johnson comps aren't terrible looks, the problem is this dude is practically unplayable on defense. 

Brice has to be pulled from the game at times because his defense really is that bad even at the G League level, I know I talk about how bad Jordan Clarkson is defensively but Brice Sensabaugh is genuinely not even close to ready on that end of the floor, his man is getting a bucket constantly and it's the reason Utah hasn't given him significant mins. He even comes off the bench for the Stars some nights due to how much of a disadvantage it can be. 

It's just wild because I do feel like long term he could actually stick around in the league which is difficult to do for a 28 pick, I'd even go as far as to say that if he could defend at an even half acceptable level he could be a good bench piece in a few years time. I guess the reason I bring this up is because I've seen a lot of social media posts talking about how ""NBA ready"" this guy is, vs what the reality of the situation with him is, he's not in the same boat as Hendricks, but he's doing better than anyone could've expected for a pick that late. 

It makes me wonder if he's going to get a legitimate shot this year with the Jazz and if Utah can afford to give up defense in exchange for giving Brice some needed development at the higher level. Anyways, I'm pretty high on Brice still personally.. I'm moreso hoping Hendricks gets back to the Jazz because there are games where I feel like he'd have been a genuine help, just wondering if Utah also tries to bring up Sensabaugh.",UtahJazz,14,https://www.reddit.com/r/UtahJazz/comments/1afcq3o/slc_stars_lose_to_the_rip_city_remix_despite_a/

2023-12-07,1701928415,"A quarter of the way through the year, here's how this team stacks up to previous rebuilding Jazz squads.","Kinda a random post so I apologize if it's too out there but I want to give this season a comparison to some more of the recent ""rebuild"" jazz years, some didn't end up being rebuild years by the end but started or aimed on that trajectory. 

21 games is just over 25% of the season and Utah sits at 7-14 behind some surprise wins and ugly losses. Lots of injuries around the board, lots of development, lots of shortcomings from guys who haven't taken the jump and a protected pick that makes it all complicated has led this into being a stressful season to say the least. However I want to compare it to some of the previous rebuild years this far in.

2014-2015: Utah who had newly drafted Dante Exum &amp; Rodney Hood ran a lineup of Kanter, Hayward, Favors, Burke and Burks with some switch in of Exum and Hood among a few others, they started 5-7 before losing a whopping 9 straight starting 5-16 through the first 21. 

-The problem: Enes Kanter, who ended up being moved with Steve Novak for a pick and technically Kendrick Perkins at the deadline. This allowed Rudy Gobert to truly shine and things immediately flipped for Utah who finished the year 38-44, impressive considering in mid Feb they were 19-34. 

-How does it compare to now? Well that season didn't have that high of expectations whereas there were clearly some higher expectations this year, I Don't necessarily think moving THT and Sexton would fix everything but it could very well be like the Kanter move opening up the door for better ball movement. In a more direct comparison I could see Olynyk moved to free up some more Hendricks minutes and maybe it's his time to shine? Wishful thinking on my end though and I really love Olynyk still despite some flaws. 

2013-2014: this was supposed to be like the 22-23 Jazz however the 23' Jazz over performed by a mile early on. Utah started 0-8, won a game, then lost the next 6 going 1-14, they'd grab a quick 3 game win streak and go 4-17 a quarter in. 

-The problem? It was truly a hard tank year and the team was just young across the board with lots of issues, nothing was necessarily solved as nothing needed to be solved really. The Jazz finished 25-57 and got the 5 pick landing Exum and grabbed Rodney Hood with pick 23. 

-How does it compare to now? Honestly the 2014 squad is far worse than the current Jazz team, I'd say the 14-15 season is closer to where Utah is now but the expectation of the season was still different and neither of these teams had an all star like Lauri or needed to rest a lot of guys to lose. 

2017-2018: Yes I'm going to call this a rebuilding year because of Hayward and Hill's departure however this is the anomaly. Mitchell's rookie year had a wild start with Utah starting 10-11 through the first 21, however things went all over the place following that. 

-The problem? Well I don't want to blame Rodney Hood or Joe Johnson but clearly the move for Jae Crowder helped them, Mitchell really took off and after starting 19-28, Utah managed to finish 48-34 and win a playoff series. 

How does it compare to now? I feel like Utah adding a playmaker wouldn't quite cause the flip that we saw this season or even like the 2014-15 year, but addressing the issue and making a move completely flipped both of those years. I think Utah had a lot more depth in that season and a bigger variety of talent across the board. 

2015-2016: What was supposed to be the first run at the playoffs for the Hayward led Jazz started 10-11 through the first 21. Some games they looked great, others they really struggled to figure things out.

The problem: poor point guard play, which lasted the whole year. Utah saw Neto, Exum and Burke all split minutes here and none quite took the jump needed for this team to succeed. Hayward was close to all star caliber as was Rudy imo but the addition of Shelvin Mack wouldn't be enough to fix things as they finished 40-42 just missing the playoffs. They would end up trading Taurean Prince for George Hill in the 16' draft. 

How does it compare to now? Well its the reason I read into this, I think the current Jazz team has a lot of similarities to the 2015-16 squad, 40 wins is a huge stretch for where this current team is at however between poor point guard play and a team that needs some clear development across the board I feel like I'm watching that team again, but this squad has a lot more draft capital. 

Beyond this is a few other years that don't compare as much but have some interesting flips

2010-2011: Utah Starts 15-5, Sloan resigns, D-Will gets moved and they end up 39-43, I'm pretty sure their pick was lottery protected so I noticed that similarity pretty quick, but this current Jazz team has started on the polar opposite end. 

2004-2005: Utah starts 4-0, would be 9-12 to start, but finish 26-56... I've seen this season compared a lot to our current situation but I don't think we'll finish this poorly despite the start. After 03-04 there is a case to be made that the current team has followed this same pattern. 

2011-2012: Utah started rough but 25% in was 12-9, the play quickly picked up though and in a lockout year they grabbed the 8 seed finishing 36-30 after closing on a 5 game win streak. This team lacked talent in a lot of ways but still had some great role player production. Oddly enough I could see a few similarities between this squad and the current squad as well. This team had a lot of fight late in the year and I'd hope the current squad has that in them too. 

2018-2019: again, shouldn't really be considered a rebuild year but the team started 9-12.. they finished with just a couple more wins I guess managing to get 50 lmao. Obviously a very different squad than the one we have now and a much more complete team across the board, but wouldn't it be a dream if our current squad had this kind of turnaround? For real though those early Mitchell years were wild, absolutely wild. 

If I had to guess right now I think Utah compares most to the 14-15 and 15-16 squads who fell shy of the playoffs after making a trade deadline adjustment. I guess the question is, do you guys see similarities to the previous rebuild squads or is it kind of new territory?",UtahJazz,7,https://www.reddit.com/r/UtahJazz/comments/18cowb7/a_quarter_of_the_way_through_the_year_heres_how/

2024-07-11,1720702401,Keyonte playmaking experiment,"Hello guys, my first post here. First of all, gotta compliment your sub, many other team subs are either dead or filled with over-reactors that really take away the joy from the game we love.

Now, to the subject at hand. For the life of me, I don't see a point guard in Keyonte. It seems to be a failing experiment. I think it is better for him to try to make it in this league the way he naturally is, a shooting guard with some secondary playmaking upside. He is too turnover-prone, and gifted as he is in the scoring department, he gravitates to score heavily. The guy already has a lot of elite shots in his bag.

Will he make it as a little bit undersized two guard without any extraordinary leaping abilities, it remains to be seen. In my opinion, his ''key'' to sustained success will be to master the art of free throw drawing., and these two summer league appearances are pointing in that direction, which is good because last season that part of his game left a lot to be desired. He got stronger as we can all see, so maybe he will be more decisive with his drives this year, less afraid of contact. If anyone watched the entirety of both of these SL games, were the free throws legit, skillfully drawn?

At the very least he's smooth af with it offensively, that we can all agree upon so his 6th man potential future is a wrap I suppose. Anyways... what do you guys think? Is he gonna get ""transferred"" to a two guard by Hardy come All Star break? Do you see him as the Jazz future point guard still (not talking about no combo)?

What do you think of him?

2023-12-11,1702270424,"Jazz lead the league in % of shots at 3-10 feet, but are 21st in FG% (43.1%).","In keeping with the analytics revolution of the last decade, with the Harden microball Rockets and the small ball Warriors, we have almost completely excised the long 2 from our shot diet. It's good because we're among the league's worst at shooting those. Meanwhile, we're also 21st in FG% from 3, which is not good, but at least it's a respectable 35%, so we're getting 1.05 points per shot.

**However**, we shoot 43.1% on shots 3-10 feet from the basket, good for 0.86 points per shot. Not only that, but we take a full 26% of our shots from there, tops in the league by a decent amount.

Looking through our biggest offenders, we'll look at our 7 players with the highest % FGA from that range. This excludes Lauri, Ochai, KellyO, and Fontecchio.

Further filtering out those 7, I will exclude Kris Dunn and Yurtseven, because their sample size is relatively small (both have taken &lt;60 FGA on the season).

That leaves our 5 big time shot takers: Clarkson, THT, Sexton, Collins, and Keyonte, in descending order by % of shots taken that are 3-10 feet away from the basket.

Of these players, both JCs (46.7% and 44.1% FG%, respectively) are forgiveable. Neither shoot it super well from there, but it's almost at the point where it's worth taking it there just to remind defenses that they can do it. It's obviously a far cry from KD's ludicrous 52.6% FG% from there, but even then, he takes fewer than 20% of his shots in that space.

That leaves three guys: THT, Sexton, and Keyonte. THT takes a full 32% of his shots between 3-10 feet and makes them at a rate of 41.5% of the time. Sexton takes almost 29% and makes it 40.7% of the time. Keyonte is at 25% frequency and 39.6% FG%.

This, along with watching their play, screams to me a couple of things. These shots seem to arise from either (a) a byproduct of them pulling up early for a floater because the layup is covered or them poking around and (b) taking funky falling sideways jumpers after picking up their dribble down low. They are taking these shots, but surely their teammates can find a better shot almost every single play it happens.

Between these three, they have taken 179 FGA from 3-10 feet and converted 27 + 24 + 21 = 72 of them. In our 22 games, so far, that's an average of 8.1 FGA at a rate of 40.2%.

It's kind of funny that we were so beastly from that range last season, 1st in frequency, 3rd in percentage. The prior season was 2nd in frequency, 3rd in percentage. Everyone, not just Mike Conley was feasting from there last year, including Clarkson and Sexton. I speculate that the collapse of our spacing and departure of all of our competent and methodical ball handlers contribute to our inability to be good in this space anymore.",UtahJazz,3,https://www.reddit.com/r/UtahJazz/comments/18fmnne/jazz_lead_the_league_in_of_shots_at_310_feet_but/

2023-10-30,1698687393,Let's pump the brakes on the hate...,"Considering the Jazz are only 3 games into the season, I've been shocked/disappointed by the number of ""this team stinks"" comments that I've seen. I wanna take this in two bites:

## Team Play
It's true, the team did not play super well against the Kings or the Suns. Open shots weren't falling, cuts weren't getting seen by the guards, fastbreak defense was poor (to say the least). Those two games were pretty ugly. 

But... We're only 3 games into the season.

I know at this point last year, the Jazz were 3-0 and things were looking up. The difference is that this year, there are actual expectations, the roster got better, we know how capable the rookies/sophomores are. It's hard to look at the results from last year and think that this team is going to be anything less than a lottery team again.

But let's look at the three opponents:

1. Kings (3rd in the West last year)
2. Clips (5th in the West last year - healthy PG, Kahwi &amp; Russ)
3. Suns (4th in the West last year - healthy KD)

And they won one of those games.

I don't want to say that the quality of play has been _good_, but I would argue that it probably should have been _expected_.

## Individual Play
It really bums me out seeing people dunk on Walker saying that he's been playing like garbage or that THT and Collin need to be benched, because they are (all three) still very capable players. If I'm in Will Hardy's head, I'm still experimenting with new players, new defensive schemes, new rotations, and I don't think 3 games is enough to really make a decision on what works/what doesn't.

I totally see (and mostly agree with) the argument that Keyonte has been the best PG so far, but it's gotta be tough to switch up rotations, especially after only 3 games. The Jazz have 6 very capable guards. The trick is figuring out how they all fit on the team. I'm pretty sure that one or two of them will be traded before too long, but we'll have to see.



I guess I just want everyone to pump the brakes a little bit. The zone that they are running on defense, Keyonte, some of these rotations all look like they are going to be awesome. It is just going to take a larger sample size to decide what works and what does not.",UtahJazz,32,https://www.reddit.com/r/UtahJazz/comments/17jyww5/lets_pump_the_brakes_on_the_hate/

Didn't expect this, but Collin Sexton has the highest (See worst) defensive rating in the entire NBA. Clarkson is close at #10. 

[https://craftednba.com/player-traits/sieve](https://craftednba.com/player-traits/sieve)

This one has Clarkson as the #1 worst defender and Sexton as number 11. Keyonte at 21.  
That makes me a little bit worried. The only good defenders we have on this team are Kessler, and to a lesser extent Hendricks and maybe Cody Williams. That is a bit scary to me. 

I really hope that Collier comes in and plays great defense so he can get some minutes this year, because we clearly need as much help on defense as we can get, especially at the guard position. 

If we are planning on looking for a long term 1/2 guard to put next to Keyonte, I really think we should focus on getting a lockdown defender. 

If orlando doesn't resign Jalen Suggs, I think he would be a perfect back court partner for Keyonte. Another could be Cade Cunningham if he eventually asks for a trade from detroit. He has great size, can handle the ball and shoot, and can defend a little bit. He would be able to play into his defense more on the jazz with another ball handler/scorer instead of handling the entire offense. 

Dyson Daniels would be interesting if we could pry him away from New Orleans. I know they would be interested in Kessler, as they need rim protection and floor spacing, and Kessler has one with the potential of adding the other.

Interestingly, the talks suggested by sources are not for future draft capital. The Jazz, sources say, called the Nets to inquire about Mikal Bridges, though they found the same impossibly high bar to clear in return.

Utah seems to be pursuing upgrades to the roster and not rebuilding moves.

Olynyk, in particular, is highly sought after in the market. He's a backup center in a market in which everyone wants size help for the playoffs who can also shoot, pass and defend. Miami has shown interest in Olynyk in the past, though with their recent seven-game slide, one source said, ""No one knows what the hell Miami is going to do in the next week, as much as we know what any team will do.""",UtahJazz,28,https://www.reddit.com/r/UtahJazz/comments/1aihia3/matt_moore_utah_jazz_have_inquired_about_mikal/

For me, Ive always wanted to follow the NBA, but never really knew how to get into it since none of my family or friends were fans. I lice in a state without an NBA team. When covid hot, and the trams were all sent to the bubble, I figured it was the perfect time to start following. I wanted to root for a team, and I chose the Jazz because I loved the idea of a musical genre being the team mascot. Plus, I loved the irony of the Utah Jazz, since Utah isnt really all that jazzy!

2024-01-21,1705819559,Hot take after tonights game: the sole reason Lauri doesnt get fed the ball is not because of hero/iso ball,"Its a combination of Lauri not being a huge playmaker and our guards being more scoring focused than playmaking focused.

Its not like Clarkson and Sexton are purposely denying Lauri. Its a combination of Lauri knowing where he is efficient and getting to his spots, the defense recognizing and covering, and our guards not setting up a place for Lauri to get another shot/Lauri not being able to get to  another spot if he isnt set up because again he isnt a huge playmaker.

Thats just my take feel free to agree or disagree.

As far as inspiration, we have our new state flag to draw from, which could be cool for all of the teams to incorporate. 
However, I believe most likely is a purple-themed branding. Everyone here loves purple and wants it to be part of the Jazz identity, Id like to see it incorporated with our NHL team, as well as a potential MLB team down the road.

First close game so far this year, the rookies struggled tonight in a lot of different ways but still think they're going to be just fine. I think once the rookies get picked back up I'll probably drop a bunch of the covering of these games but I do enjoy keeping up with the Stars since they're still fun to watch and quite literally have future Jazz pieces. 

-Christopher, Was great tonight going 14-23 to score 33, just absolutely took over late game. Looked way confident as well. 

-Potter, was a flamethrower, going 4-7 from three and 9-14 with 11 boards and 5 assists, him and Christopher had some nice dunks late. 

-Sensabaugh, didn't hit anything from 3 going 4-16 from the field and 0-8 from deep, had 8 points.. he started 4-5 so it was a tough one for him. Still had some good passes though and makes the right plays. 

-Juzang, had 27 on 9-14 shooting, just a great offensive game, didn't make almost any mistakes tonight 

-Hendricks, had 12 on 4-12 shooting, rough game offensively but did some good stuff on the defensive end. He's still an elite on ball defender and had a couple nice blocks tonight. 

-Michael Devoe went 5-9 with 16 points, been crazy underrated. 

Not as much to take away that's really new besides Christopher really exploding tonight along with Potter who I think makes some brilliant decisions. Great win for them tonight. Thinking we'll see the rookies back in Utah along with potentially another guy or two once the new year hits if not earlier.

Random as well but if there's one guy who I think could come in right now and help the Jazz it's actually Micah Potter due to Kessler being out. His size and decision making are underrated and when he's hot he gets real hot. Obviously I want Taylor and Brice to be there as well but I think giving them some more G League time will be good ",UtahJazz,7,https://www.reddit.com/r/UtahJazz/comments/17x6ql8/slc_stars_win_129121_over_the_stockton_kings/
2023-11-05,1699158044,Warm take but I think a lot of people are overreacting to this stretch and I'm kinda tired of the narratives that have been created... and Hendricks deserves patience.,"Look I've seen the ""we should've tanked harder"" statement at least 30 times over the last week and while yeah a top 3 pick would've been nice, we weren't guaranteed it even if we had been bottom 3. I hate having to defend the team after losing by 30 but there are so many different variables to look at here with the current roster and I'm the biggest Hendricks defender on the planet so bare with me. 

For one, is the roster similar? Sure, but most of this team wasn't together for the last 30 games of last year. This team is clearly still experimenting and seven games in clearly has a long, long way to go. I think Collins is getting better and better, Kessler needs touches and I think he's going to get them with time, Lauri is still incredible, there are things that will get better with time. 

 yes, we have played a ridiculously hard schedule, and yes it has thrown us off. That is a thing that happens in this league and it's a valid excuse to make early in the year. This goes back to the last point a bit but if we were a good 25 games in I'd be more concerned but we aren't the only team who's sitting at 2-5 let alone only team who expected to be a bit better sitting at 2-5.. and yes we lost the Sacramento, Phoenix and Minnesota games badly, but we gave Denver and Orlando a fight, Orlando is also very underrated, and the clippers win was very impressive. 

When looking at team struggles I look at a few guys but THT and Sexton are looking AWFUL straight up. I'm not going to blame them for all of the struggles but I can't deny that Utah should be shopping them as soon as possible and I'd imagine THT starting kind of implies that he's being shopped. Sexton is hard to determine but with THT's contract expiring you have to imagine Utah is keeping their eye out on potential moves, and even if it's a ""sell"" move it would be hard to get much worse losing THT or Sexton at this point

Keyonte has been a huge positive, one of the best rookies of the class, and Utah got him at 16. He has been a huge upside and he will get better than where he's at now. 

Taylor Hendricks being in the G league is completely fine, this is exactly the type of player you want on your team, he isn't an immediate day 1 impact. He needs to put on weight, needs to get better with his ball control and just getting used to the flow of the NBA, I genuinely believe he will be fine. 

Do I believe a top 3 pick would've been nice? Yeah sure, but to act like it screwed us that bad is just a wild overreaction this early. I genuinely think Hendricks will be an impact piece and will be our best perimeter defender or dare I say our best overall defender with time. 

To continue on Hendricks, he hasn't even been bad in the time he's played, but he's barely played. In preseason he looked fine but again, he's barely played, and I would love him to play more and more and I'm sure he will get to, but in the meantime let's see him with the stars and let him be the number one guy on that team. He was a guy who could defend anyone in college and shot 40% from 3. He didn't go top 10 for no reason. It's not a bad thing he hasn't played though, management knew it would be a project.

Look I get barely anyone is going to be on the same page as me, but can we at least give it another 10-15 games before we start to make big assumptions? And beyond that, can we stop disrespecting Taylor Hendricks so much? At least until he's had a big enough sample size with the team lol. 

Edit: I just wanna add how underrated Agbaji has been, I wish Utah would just start him at this point for defensive purposes and he will get better as the year goes on. 

TL;DR: we will be fine, especially if THT and Sexton get moved, and I still think it's too early to determine the direction of the team.",UtahJazz,33,https://www.reddit.com/r/UtahJazz/comments/17o464k/warm_take_but_i_think_a_lot_of_people_are/

2024-06-17,1718640152,The Case for and Against 2024 Draft Prospects at #10,"Here are some of my thoughts about guys the Jazz are rumored to be interested in. No particular order aside from likely/possible/unlikely. 

**Most Likely Not Available at 10:**

* **Alex Sarr** - 7'1"" Stretch 4/5 19 y/o - New Zealand
   * **For:** Arguably the best player available in the draft
   * **Against:** No chance that he's available at 10
* **Zaccharie Risacher** - 6'9"" Wing 19 y/o - France
   * **For:** Low floor player, solid shooting splits
   * **Against:** Won't be available at 10
* **Reed Sheppard** - 6'1"" Shooting Guard 19 y/o - Kentucky
   * **For:** The best shooter in the draft, sneakily athletic and a solid defender
   * **Against:** Won't be available at 10
* **Stephon Castle** - 6'6"" Combo Guard 19 y/o - UConn
   * **For:** Solid all-around guy, good defender, wants to be a playmaker
   * **Against:** Not a great shooter, unlikely to be available at 10
* **'Donovan Clingan** - 7'2"" Center 20 y/o - UConn
   * **For:** Versatile big that can easily anchor a defense, his offensive game is growing
   * **Against:** Derivative of Walker Kessler, unlikely to be available at 10
* **Matas Buzelis -** 6'11"" Wing/Stretch Big 19 y/o - G-League Ignite
   * **For:** Lanky big wing that's athletic and has one of the higher ceilings in the draft
   * **Against:** Bad shooter, very skinny, unlikely to be available at 10 

**Possibly Available at 10:**

* **Tidjane Salaun** - 6'9"" Wing 18 y/o - France
   * **For:** High ceiling prospect, he seems very confident in himself and his abilities. His numbers are decent, showing potential for being an effective NBA player. 
   * **Against:** Very raw prospect who has high bust potential. Right now his decision making is questionable at best, and likely won't be a factor in the NBA for his first year or two at least. 
* **Cody Williams** - 6'8"" Wing 19 y/o - Colorado
   * **For:** If he's available, I think this is who the Jazz take unless someone unexpected falls. He's a decent sized wing with excellent shooting splits. Has decent athleticism and has a lot of potential to be a high-level starter in the NBA. 
   * **Against:** Somewhat timid in his time at Colorado playing behind Tristan Da Silva. Will need a mindset change if he projects to be a primary option. He's also skinny right now and is going to need to put on weight in order to be a solid defender. 
* **Nikola Topic** - 6'6"" Point Guard 18 y/o - Serbia
   * **For:** The best playmaker in the draft averaging over 7 assists per game overseas. Unafraid to score on the inside and an elite free-throw shooter. 
   * **Against:** Torn ACL that will likely need surgery and redshirt for his first year in the league. Right now he's a bad shooter with concerning form. He's not very athletic and has a negative wingspan which makes him a big concern on the defensive end projecting to be a mediocre defender at best. 
* **Rob Dillingham** - 6'1"" Point Guard 19 y/o - Kentucky
   * **For:** Personal favorite prospect of mine. He's athletic, a great shooter and bursting with natural talent. Assuming his size doesn't get in the way, he has the potential to be an offensive juggernaut being able to create for himself and his teammates.
   * **Against:** Size is an issue being the skinniest guy in the draft. Unless he can put on a lot of muscle quick, his defensive ceiling is concerningly low. 
* **Ron Holland** - 6'8"" Wing 18 y/o - G-League Ignite
   * **For:** Hyper athletic wing who has one of the highest ceilings in the draft. He's young, unafraid and willing to put in the dirty work to make winning plays. 
   * **Against:** His draft stock is falling quite a bit, many believing it's because of attitude issues/unimpressive interviews. He's super young, so he has some room to mature, but that's always hit and miss. His shooting numbers were also quite unimpressive shooting only 24% from 3 last season. 
* **Dalton Knecht** - 6'6"" Guard/Wing 23 y/o - Tennessee
   * **For:** Arguably one of the most pure scorers in the draft. He's clutch, a great shooter and can finish around the rim. Looking like he will likely be a day-one contributor.
   * **Against:** One of the oldest prospects in the draft putting a lower ceiling on his potential. He's also not very athletic and is frequently targeted by opposing offenses. 

**Likely Available at 10:** 

* **Jared McCain** - 6'3"" Combo Guard 20 y/o - Duke
   * **For:** Solid shooter and scorer anywhere on the court. Elite free throw shooter and excellent from 3. Decent playmaker despite low assist numbers, does not turn the ball over much. Looks to be like a good locker room guy. 
   * **Against:** Questions about the fact that he's a 20 year old freshman. He has a hard time creating space for himself sometimes which is essential at his size. Projects to be a point guard but assist numbers are low. 
* **Zach Edey**  - 7'4"" Center 22 y/o - Purdue
   * **For:** Absolute monster in college, bigger than everyone and had his way against a lot of defenses. Got to the free throw line a lot.
   * **Against:** Big and slow. He's a liability on the perimeter on both sides of the court, lack of athleticism is a big question mark about him thriving in the NBA. He's also an older prospect and does not fill a need for the Jazz. 
* **Kyshawn George** - 6'8"" Wing 20 y/o - Miami
   * **For:** Solid shooter, passer and defender. Seems to have a natural feel all over the place on the court and give solid effort on both ends.
   * **Against:** Did not have a very big role on his college team, usually being a 3rd/4th option on offense. He's also unathletic and needs to put on muscle for his defense to translate to the NBA. 
* **Isaiah Collier** - 6'4"" Combo Guard 19 y/o - USC
   * **For:** Projecting to be a Colin Sexton-esque player in the NBA. High motor, good ball handler, and a solid shooter/scorer. 
   * **Against:** Unpolished, he makes a lot of careless mistakes. Shooting mechanics are there but inefficient, possibly due to decision making, but regardless needs to get that down to be a threat from 3. 
* **Devin Carter** - 6'3"" Combo Guard 22 y/o - Providence
   * **For:** High effort on both ends. Great work ethic and rebounds at an impressive rate for his size. Shooting numbers are decent and seems to be a day-one contributor. 
   * **Against:** He's an older prospect, putting a ceiling on his potential. Playmaking is mediocre for a lead-guard, and tends to pass out when driving. Shooting needs to be proven at an NBA level. 
* **Pacome Dadiet** - 6'8"" Wing 18 y/o - France
   * **For:** One of the youngest prospects in the draft, his BBIQ seems to be solid and his shooting numbers are impressive with 61% true shooting. His body is NBA ready, he's athletic and quick looking to be a potential steal, especially if he drops (many mocks have him late 1st to early 2nd)
   * **Against:** Extremely raw with a lot still unknown. Will likely not be a contributor for his first year or two due to a steep learning curve in the NBA. He's still somewhat sloppy, turning the ball over and fouling at a high rate. ",UtahJazz,29,https://www.reddit.com/r/UtahJazz/comments/1di1ojc/the_case_for_and_against_2024_draft_prospects_at/

2024-02-05,1707169790,The Dejounte Rumors are heating up more and more so I figured I'd share a few thoughts on them since I've watched a ton of him this season.,"Before I start typing I just wanna say if you're a Hawks fan, 1, yes I've watched Atlanta a ton, I know Dejounte has more value than people give credit for, 2, that same thing could be said for Utahs assets, also at the end of this I do some wild trade ideas so bare with me lol. 

Heard multiple different sources talking about it and some of the trade ideas mentioned were centered around Colin or Ochai+salary(THT, or Kelly but Olynyk would add value to said deal) and two firsts which definitely outshines what other teams are offering but.. it's a lot. 

Murray has a long contract, he'd be on board for five years and this guy is a legit player with a killer mentality, he's clutch, he can defend, struggles to stay consistent from 3 but absolutely takes over in the midrange. As a fit he would be undoubtedly what Utah wants. 

Like I said though, Utah would be expected to ""overpay"" which in this case I think Colin + two firsts does seem like an overpay, especially with the energy Sexton brings, the reason I could see Sexton dealt is if Utah truly feels like Murray is the piece they want on this core (which imo he'd be a pretty good option) and not pushing Keyonte even further back in the rotation. 

On the other hand Utah could give up Ochai Agbaji who I've been higher on than probably most other fans this season have been, and also THT or someone else to match the contract. What makes this tough is I personally over value Ochai but I'm sure a lot of NBA GM's feel the same way about him, guys who put in a ton of effort and have potential as a 3&amp;D piece who can guard 1-4, it's a valued piece in the playoffs. 

I don't think Hawks fans would want either deal reading this but Hawks management on the other hand might think a bit differently. A problem from Utahs end is they'd definitely have to make other moves to balance things out, probably moving Clarkson for example or getting off of the Collins deal. 

I ran the trade machine here though and did some wild stuff... Trade 1: Three team deal w/LA

-Utah Receives, Murray, Gabe Vincent, protection removal on 2027 First via LAL (sends pick to ATL)

-Atlanta receives, Ochai, THT, 2027 Pick Via LAL (now unprotected), 2029 Pick Via MIN (top 5 protected) 

-LA Receives: Kelly Olynyk, 2nd round pick from ATL (2028 Houston?)

This one is absolutely wild but Gabe Vincent essentially just replaces THT on the bench, Atlanta gets their 2 firsts + Ochai which with that Laker pick being unprotected in this case it's a killer pick, the Minnesota one just adds to their capital and that's what they really value, LA gets off of the Gabe Vincent deal and adds Kelly+a 2nd, imo they would absolutely take this if possible. 

Deal 2:

-Utah Receives: Murray

-ATL receives: Colin, 2025 First via MIN, 2027 first via LAL top 4 protected

this is straightforward, Colin + two picks, in this case the LA pick stays top 4 protected and could likely fall into the 2nd round if that goes top 4. 

Deal 3: 

-Utah Receives: Murray, Wesley Matthews

-ATL receives: Colin, Yurtseven, 2025 pick via MIN, 2027 pick via MIN

Atlanta has no reason to take on yurt unless they were making other moves but imo he's just a better piece than Wesley Matthews is at this point and it would ""sweeten"" this deal in a sense, this one's just out there though. 

Deal 4: 

-Utah Receives: Murray

-ATL receives: Ochai, THT, 2025 pick via CLE, 2027 pick via MIN

This is essentially just a straightforward version of the Ochai deal. There are more potential deals but I just cringe at most of these since I feel like no one truly walks out happy but I could be wrong. 

All things considered, yeah I'd love Dejounte, he's not a superstar but he could very well be a long term piece, he's going to cost a good chunk of money next year but his contract lasts until 2028 where he'd make $31 million a year. I really love the idea of him playing in lineups with Lauri, Dunn, Kessler etc though and he would bring a lot to the table for Utah. 

The other benefit is with the team getting better he would help the pick convey and with his contract being as long as it is this is technically looking at the ""long term"" though. It's gonna come down to what Atlanta is asking for him in the end though and how much Danny is willing to pay. Again, as a huge Ochai and Colin fan, these are tough trades for me to make, but I do feel like long term they would be beneficial 

Edit: some thoughts that I just had after finishing typing, the Lakers probably don't wanna help the Jazz, but I do feel like they're helping themselves as well. Also I didn't really share my personal opinion on this but I think if Utah is giving up Colin, Atlanta should be getting one good first rounder rather than two. Just my thoughts there 

Edit 2: so I came up with a random idea and I don't know if it works entirely (I just tried it on that fanspo trade machine) but here's another offer that combines the Knicks rumors with the hawks ones 

-Utah Receives: Murray, Evan Fournier

-NYK receives: Clarkson

-ATL Receives: Quentin Grimes, THT, three or four 2nd round picks via NY, 2025 first round pick from Utah (Cleveland pick?) 

Atlanta would get a young talent in this deal, Utah keeps Sexton and Ochai, New York doesn't send off a first to Utah for JC but just 2nds instead and Atlanta receives those allowing Utah to only move one pick, I did Cleveland here instead of MIN since it's likely to be a more valuable pick, but yeah this one is a last minute wild one that I'm not sure works again, just throwing it out there ",UtahJazz,23,https://www.reddit.com/r/UtahJazz/comments/1ajsnsd/the_dejounte_rumors_are_heating_up_more_and_more/

hows walker kessler developing? wouldve expected his stats to rise instead of falling. i was low on him coming into the league but that was also not founded in knowing ball and he won me over a bit with team usa. was john collins getting the starts over kessler a good call based on how each of them were playing? ill always give will hardy the benefit of the doubt but im uneducated about the rationale there.

i knew more about the draft last year and i was extremely high on taylor hendricks. from what i saw he looked like he could be unbelievable. i actually convinced myself based on his movement and shooting that he could actually end up being a jumbo wing, was hoping that the pacers would trade up in the lottery again and put him next to jarace long term. turns out jarace ended up being that instead kinda lol. hows that development looking? does he seem to be projecting as that kinda off-ball wing i was imagining or is he more of a typical stretch big? how do you see him fitting in long term?

The running joke is that cutting THT from the rotation is the reason for our success. The real reason is that Hardy has figured out how our roster fits together rotationally, specifically I wanted to look at Clarkson coming off the bench vs. Sexton coming off the bench.

Clarkson played in 19 of the first 23 games, starting them all. He was injured during the game on 12/11/23; enter Sexton into the starting lineup. Sexton has started the last 16 games (Clarkson missed the first 6 with injury) and has been great! This is not meant as a slight at Clarkson, but rather as an applaud to the fact that they have clear roles and specific lineups that they play with now that set them both up for more success.

Clarkson starts: Record 5-14, 30.4 mpg, 16.6 ppg, 3.4 rpg, 4.9 apg, 40/30/83 shooting splits, 49.8% ts%, 26.5 usg%, -7.1 bpm

Sexton off the bench: Record 7-16, 20.7 mpg, 12.7 ppg, 2.7 rpg, 3.2 apg, 45/33/88 shooting splits, 58% ts%, 26.1 usg%, -1.5 BPM

2023-12-07,1701937554,My dissertation on why we should NOT trade Lauri,"Title says it all.  If you read all this thank you and I love you.

I hate the idea of trading Lauri to any other team. Hes only 27. Were in the second year of a rebuild. Why do we need to reset again when we got a good player from a trade where we were trying to reset in the first place a year ago. Do we suck? Yes. Is sucking more gonna solve anything? No. 

More picks isnt gonna solve anything for this team, we have plenty already from the cavs and timberwolves and ourselves. We just need to draft well with those picks and ours. Lauri is a good, young player to build around. I feel right now he is a #2 option on a championship team. Just cause every team wants him doesnt mean we should trade him. 

Even with the most sure thing, the draft is a gamble. Look at Zion, look at Cade Cunningham. Theyre both #1 picks and good players and they were seen as consensus #1 picks. But are they the reason a team is in the promised land? Are they cornerstones to build around? In my opinion, theyre not. 1 is injured too much and another hasnt shown me enough to be that generational of a talent. Why trade a great player, who by all reports wants to be here, for what is essentially a few lottery tickets?

I think theres an obsession within NBA subreddits/twitter with picks. Everyone loves the unknown of a draft pick. While it is good to have picks, you cant revolve your whole franchise around them. They are valuable, especially for a rebuilding franchise, but they cannot guarantee you will hit on them and get a star. You could get Lebron or Luka with a high pick. Or you can get Ben Simmons. Nothing is guaranteed.

So why trade a commodity that has never been rumored as wanting to leave, when we havent even tried to build anything around him? Why just give up and say Youre not worth trying to build around, to a guy who made an all star team last year, and again, wants to be here?

2024-05-21,1716322524,Just thinking that this potentially could be the best time for the Jazz to be rebuilding,"While being terrible during the season sucks I do think overall I think this is a great time to suck for two reasons 

1.) The West is incredibly deep right now, and next season will be even harder with a fully healthy Grizzlies and the Rockets wanting to get into the playoffs as well. San Antonio also may say lets do it and try to build something competitive around Wemby. With how talented the west is I was thinking that even with that Gobert Mitchell team we would have had a tough time getting out of the second round of the playoffs. The Kings were a super talented team and didnt even make it into the playoffs technically. It is a tough time to compete 

2.) In three to 5 years the NBA could be expanding which will spread out some of this talent, and a lot of these teams that are super talented now will have some contract issues they will have to start working out (Minnesota and OKC specifically) also age is going to start affecting multiple teams as well (Golden State both LA teams and Phoenix) 

It will be interesting to see if the Jazz are smart these next two years that they can be playoff competitive in the west in 3 years. Which seems long but all in all would be a solid rebound after a full dismantle.

So I'm just gonna say this straight up, WHAT IS UP WITH D'MOI HODGE? Dude checks in for the Lakers off the bench and puts up 35 damn points on 7 of 14 from 3 and 65% from the field, flat out unreal performance from him and I'm wildly impressed. Anyway, onto the Stars

Brice Sensabaugh absolutely torched the second half as the stars tried to fight back, had 31 points on 11/18 and 7/11 from 3, incredible second half despite a lot of first half flaws. To add, had some great passes in the 2nd half and not all of them led to assists but his vision surprises me.  

Hendricks didn't even get a shot for like the whole 4th, ended up with 12 points on 5 of 7 however he played a great defensive game and fed into the momentum SLC had, had 9 boards, 2 blocks, 2 steals and 2 assists+ a lot of other great reads. You can definitely tell the NBA minutes would benefit him greatly and my worries about him are fading a bit because of how fast he's made improvements and just how much better he looks within the system each game. 

Micah Potter made his first 5 threes and continues to prove he's pretty much deserving of a spot in the league. 17 points, tons of great defensive plays and 4 blocks to show for it. 

Statlines don't say everything however this was an incredible night for the rookies and even when SLC guarded the perimeter it was like the Lakers just couldn't miss. Credit to Hodge tonight though for a brilliant performance off the bench as a 6th man..

Hendricks is undoubtedly ready to get some NBA minutes, I think despite the great scoring night Brice is a little further but for a 28 pick you have to be really happy especially considering 13th pick Gradey Dick just had 2 points on 1-12 the other night in the g league (he will be fine). Tomorrow could be the big night for Hendricks to get some time as Utah has a lot of guys out and I personally think you could probably sacrifice those Samanic mins for him but maybe that's just me.

Edit: gonna give credit to Nick Ongenda as well who had 6 points, 6 boards, 2 blocks and was +4, only positive +/- tonight but he built some needed momentum and despite his struggles he's clearly making improvements and I haven't brought him up in a single thread yet so shout-out to him.

2024-07-01,1719865274,Jazz Lauri Options  ,"We have 3 options. 
1. Try to trade for mid players and build a competitive team this year 

2. trade Lauri and tank, OR 

3. we extend Lauri and rest him a lot during the season to tank. 

3 should be the play no question. 

Trading a 27 year old all star who has every intention to extend has never been done in nba history. We traded Donovan because he wasnt committing. Players like KD demand trades. 

I cant believe were actually thinking about trading him. Hes a 7 foot shooter. Hes not relying on his athleticism to be great. He wont lose size or shooting over the next 10 years. PG just signed a max at 34. 

Its rare that Utah finds players that want to be here. Let alone an all star. 

Picks dont excite me. If we trade Lauri for 5 okc picks, theyll likely be the 28th pick for the next 5 years. Okc, warriors, spurs. Theyll all be stacked We have a million of mid picks and we just drafted 6 dudes over the last 2 years. 

If we trade Lauri to tank, were hoping the guy we take will turn into Lauri. He could be a bust. He could hate Utah. By the time hes to Lauris level we may only have 3-4 years with him.

We should keep Lauri, rest him a lot, tank for a high pick, stay patient to see what other teams do.

2024-02-17,1708202099,We're spending too much time and energy fitting a starting lineup around John Collins,"Okay, I wrote the title to be a bit provocative, but hear me out.

John Collins is a fine player in concept. At 6'9"", he's decently big and garners an appropriate number of rebounds. He is decently athletic, going for rim rattlers when he catches the ball on a roll. He's shot the 3 well in the past and it has somewhat returned this season, indicating that his woes last year might be attributable to his bum finger. He has a FG% over 50% and a good FT% for a big, which all add up to an efficiency over 60% TS.

Then, the Hawks traded him and his $25M/year contract to us for Rudy Gay and a second-round pick. I think we're now running into a lot of the things that the Hawks saw, and we're holding this bag for the next 2+ seasons. He's certainly one of our better players and deserving of a rotation spot; however, who he should share the floor with is complicated.

### Lauri Markkanen / John Collins

Imagine for a second, that we're comparing John Collins to Lauri Markkanen. Not a fair comparison, as one is an All-Star candidate and our undeniable #1 option and the other a solid starter, but still worth considering. Both are tall and capable of shooting. Both use that shooting ability to get to the rim, either with or without the ball. Both are acceptable, but not amazing defenders for their height.

But look at the differences. Lauri is a significantly better shooter (this season), has one of the best TS% in the league (top 10 for non-centers), gives great effort and has a good motor, is a more disciplined defender and doesn't get as lost on D, is a better passer out of his drives, is a few inches taller, and gets fouled more and shoots more FTs.

One huge difference is that Lauri is such a deadly sniper that his shooting opens up the floor for him and his teammates. His 3 point shooting opens up his game. On the other hand, John Collins thrived rolling to the basket. He has a 3 point shot that he uses to punish when the defender sags off. It's a difference in perspective (primary/secondary skillset).

I think it's reasonable to assume that Collins will never make up this gap. That would be okay if not for the fact that he's almost always on the floor in our losing moments. He's an impressive -8.2 per 100 possessions this season, with a -12.1 On/Off. [As mentioned in the ideal starting lineups thread, the Lauri/Collins/Kessler trio is an impressive bad -18.2 Net Rating together.](https://www.reddit.com/r/UtahJazz/comments/1asepu9/what_do_you_think_the_best_starting_unit_would_be/)

### Collins' ideal situation

How has John Collins' skillset been maximized in the past? His bread and butter with the Hawks was a combination of an incredibly effective PnR game with an amazing decision-maker/passer in Trae Young and a great 3 point percentage. His defensive lapses were duct taped over with Clint Capela prowling behind and a bevy of wings (De'Andre Hunter, Cam Reddish, Kevin Huerter, Bogdan Bogdanovic). Not to say that these wings were good defenders, but they could handle size-speed appropriate matchups.

We can't give him that here. Dunn has been a nice revelation, but he doesn't pose the same shooting/playmaking threat that Trae Young does. Keyonte's picking it up quickly, but he and Collins aren't quite on the same page yet. On defense, he has a much larger role when he and Lauri are the only bigs on the floor and they're surrounded now by a bunch of guards (with Fontecchio getting traded). Additionally, his 3P% has dropped since the early part of the season. If we were going to park him in the corner and ask him to catch-and-shoot 3's and sometimes backcut, we might as well put in other guys. Kelly Olynyk helped open up these lineups via a combination of good shooting/spacing/playmaking, but he's gone now too. We don't have rotational wings anymore (except maybe Taylor Hendricks). He's practically an undersized stretch 5 at this point.


### The team's ideal lineups

So is it worth it building a lineup around him with the guys on our roster right now? Lauri's in any starting lineup by default. Sexton as well. Putting him in with Walker Kessler makes no schematic sense because why play PnR with Collins when you can put in Walker AND get the elite rim protection? You could play all 3, but we've seen how that goes, and it's at least partially because opposing teams can just run us off the court. Lauri is a walking mismatch, but playing Lauri/Collins/Kessler is us forcing ourselves into mismatches on D.

For this season, if you take him out of the starting lineup, you're either running out a purely developmental lineup (with Key/Hendricks/Kessler) or a 3 guard lineup (with Clarkson at the 3). Neither of those will be particularly good, but trading away 3 rotation players means our options are now limited.

One saving grace is if Otto Porter Jr. is somehow healthy and effective. I'm skeptical because he was playing behind Thad Young (of all people) this season, but he might help keep Collins in the starting lineup, though this would shift Walker back to the bench.

### Moving forward

I think if Collins is going to work, we'll 100% need to draft a 6'6""-6'8"" athletic 3&amp;D wing in the draft, which would make the starting lineup two of Sexton/Keyonte/Dunn + that guy (it might also be Hendricks) + Lauri + Kessler, but hopefully without pigeonholing ourselves into that choice. We could also move off a scoring guard (THT obviously, but also probably Clarkson if we can find any buyer) and get more reliable playmakers on the bench for Collins to play with in a bench lineup.

I just know that the players on our roster now don't combine super well with Collins (the starting lineups with Fontecchio were workable), and it actually might be beneficial to the team if they moved him out of the starting lineup for either better development of young players (and the tanking associated with that) or to at least pair Collins up with players who can maximize his skillset.",UtahJazz,8,https://www.reddit.com/r/UtahJazz/comments/1atbmdz/were_spending_too_much_time_and_energy_fitting_a/

2024-02-12,1707763289,"I'm pushing an agenda here and mostly preaching to the choir but Taylor Hendricks is going to be fine and dare I say, really good.","I understand this isn't my first post on him, I get I'm one of the most biased dudes towards defensive wings and bigs and I watched this dude a TON at UCF, had him number 1 on my ""Jazz selection board"" and number 4 on my overall draft board, but it doesn't change the fact that I think this dude is going to be special in the league and he absolutely deserves patience. The reason I say all of this is there's this weird negative aura surrounding every and any convo with him, like some sorta disappointment that he's not already a fleshed out piece when this is exactly what management was expecting to deal with. 

His first 10-12 games with the Jazz early in the year had bad, good and really good flashes, the bad flashes were similar to what he struggled with at UCF, his finishing and handling mainly. Again management knew this and a recent Jazz man who went through this same development process was Royce (and Vando to a lesser extent since we shipped him off before he could really develop that). His really good moments were all of his defensive moments and I see so much potential in that shot. 

Rookies almost never shoot the ball well, I mean even Key has really, really struggled from deep and he's finally hitting his rhythm but it's to be expected, especially at 19-20 you're going to see guys struggle to shoot the ball in the league, so seeing Hendricks kinda be streaky isn't a surprise at all and I really wish fans understood what they were watching here. What he does have is great mechanics especially for a big, and his near 40% clip in college wasn't an accident. 

Now we're about to watch 29 more games of him getting heavy mins and heck maybe he struggles badly through all 29, man that means he's a bust right? no. Realistically I'm expecting him to be somewhere in the middle over the rest of the year, I think as he gets more comfortable a lot more people will believe in him. It's actually common for some of the leagues best to have poor rookie outings though, especially guys who had to build their body through the years..

I know people will understandably hate the Giannis comp because that's not who Taylor is, but Giannis came into the league as a project who wasn't contributing to winning. They placed him on a wild diet, worked him everyday and didn't give up on him, they knew he had potential and he turned into a literal MVP who is practically a top 5 player every year through his prime. It took patience, and the body shares a LOT of similarities with Taylor as much as people hate it.... Taylor also shoots and defends better at his age but that's besides the point. 

I guess what I'm getting at is, I don't understand how I'm seeing so much negativity surrounding him, yeah he's had bad plays as a rookie when has that ever happened, but he also does a really good job staying with his man, making great recoveries, he already has good IQ for that end of the floor, he swats shots away really well already and overall it's just stuff that tells you he's going to stay in this league. 

Could it be PTSD of Terrance Mann, Jalen Brunson and everyone who got a wide open 3 during the last few Jazz playoff series that makes me value guys like Taylor? Yeah probably, but that's the thing, you need guys like this to win in the playoffs. A guy who can defend in and out, 1-5 in some cases while simultaneously being able to shoot the ball at a good %. 

Give Hendricks 20 pounds, some confidence and his natural development, put him next to Walker and Utah will have something really special on the defensive end. I'm willing to die on the hill of this but Taylor is going to be extremely useful and a huge piece of Utahs future, he isn't a bust and he is going to be considered a steal at 9 years from now. He just deserves the patience.",UtahJazz,13,https://www.reddit.com/r/UtahJazz/comments/1ap7c5l/im_pushing_an_agenda_here_and_mostly_preaching_to/

2024-04-03,1712174930,"An interesting article from SLC Dunk suggests that the Jazz should petition the NBA to combine Jazz franchise history with the franchise history of the ABA's Utah Stars, the first professional basketball team in Utah's history. Thoughts?","[https://www.slcdunk.com/2024/4/3/24119866/the-utah-jazz-should-make-the-former-aba-team-the-utah-stars-a-part-of-their-history-nba-zelmo-beaty](https://www.slcdunk.com/2024/4/3/24119866/the-utah-jazz-should-make-the-former-aba-team-the-utah-stars-a-part-of-their-history-nba-zelmo-beaty)

I found this article to be a fascinating read about a piece of Jazz history that doesn't get talked about quite as much: the Utah Stars. For those who don't know, the Stars were an ABA team that was left out of the NBA-ABA merger in 1976. The ABA teams that survived the merger, the Spurs, Pacers, Nets, and Nuggets, have all maintained their franchise history and records, although their championships are not recognized as official NBA championships. 

The Stars are a bit of a different story--while they lack the organizational continuity of the four teams listed above, the Jazz are something of a ""spiritual successor"" to the Stars. Without the Stars and the success that they had, winning the 1971 ABA championship, it's highly unlikely that the New Orleans Jazz would have even considered Utah a viable basketball market, let alone actually moved there. It's not too crazy to say that the Jazz as we know them today owe their existence in large part to the Utah Stars. 

Now, let's just get something out of the way: it is highly, highly unlikely that the NBA would ever actually merge the history of these two franchises together. They didn't then, and they probably won't now. These two teams may have played in the same place, but, as stated above, there was no organizational continuity. 

On the other hand, here's a potential wrinkle: what about the (seemingly) inevitable return of the Seattle Supersonics? Their official history currently lies with the Thunder due to the organizational continuity, but I would bet that when they come back as an expansion franchise, they'll likely regain their franchise history in spite of the fact that they're a completely different organization. Gary Payton will probably have his number retired by them in spite of the fact that he never actually played for the organization--just the one with the same name. So what if, when the Jazz moved to Utah, they were renamed the Stars? Would we have gotten the same treatment? Maybe. Should we discount the history of the professional basketball team that played here just because the owners were too lazy to change the name when they moved to Utah? 

With all semantics aside, I think that the bigger question is this: how does the history of the Stars shape our view of the Jazz and professional basketball in Utah? There's a narrative that the Jazz will never win a championship. We didn't tank hard enough for Wemby. We'll never be a major free-agent destination. Why would 20-something year-olds in the prime of their lives want to live in SLC when they could go to Miami or LA? That's all true. But guess what? Utah does have a professional basketball title in its history. That has happened before. Times may have been different, but I really do believe that it will happen again. 

This is already a long post, but I'll just wrap it up by saying that I think we should at least keep the Stars in mind when we think about the history and pedigree of the team that we love. I wouldn't hate to see a Stars-themed City Edition jersey one of these years (which I would love to see in a game against the 76ers). When we think about the greats, we'll all think about Karl Malone, John Stockton, Mark Eaton, AK-47, and many others. Maybe we should also think about Zelmo Beaty. 

(Fun fact: Moses Malone was drafted by the Utah Stars and played his rookie season here before the team was dissolved in the 1976 merger.

Look, I really don't mind losing (I mean, I do, but you get the point), but it's one thing to lose because you're less good, and it's another thing to lose because of stupidity. What I want to say is that what frustrates me about this team is the fact that the team COULD play better, but they don't. If the guys (read guards) shared the ball, this team could, at the very least, put up a fight with ANY team in the league, but instead, night after night we see a horror show with a bunch of iso plays and unnecessary turnovers 

And then defenders will forgive me, but Sexton has been one of the dumbest players (in basketball terms) I've ever seen, THT thinks he's Michael Jordan and JC unlearned how to play basketball. It's funny and sad how they try to resolve it themselves, lose the ball and then some player from the other team goes there and does what they would like to do (yesterday it was Anthony Edwards). It's so bizarre that when Keyonte is on the court the team COMPLETELY CHANGES. It's like going from watching a street game to actually watching an NBA franchise. 

Ultimately, it's like two teams. While we have all these problems in the backcourt, we have Lauri shooting a lot from 3, Collins doing a little bit of everything and Kessler getting back in shape.

2023-12-06,1701822635,Taylor Hendricks Propaganda Post,"Yes I know fans are beginning to like him but I want to fuel that hype and keep it alive long term and make Hendricks Island grow. Kinda a follow up to my [Ochai Agbaji propaganda post](https://www.reddit.com/r/UtahJazz/s/7N1RotHMIO) however my history with Hendricks goes well into last year. I watched a lot of UCF last year and Hendricks was my most wanted player for the Jazz followed by Cason Wallace. I knew he'd be a longer project needing like 15-25lbs added before he could be an impact but after watching Utah lack someone who could defend inside and out at an elite level, watching this guy at UCF was a breath of fresh air and like Ochai's perimeter defense it stuck with me. 

I want to make a few things clear though, for one: yes we're going into only his 2nd rotational game tomorrow, development isn't short for anyone. Two: yes he needs to put on weight still, but three: watch how he defends when he's got the ball handler and pay attention to the little things. 

I was stoked to see him land at 9 on draft night, Jarace Walker went 8 and was another great fit but I preferred Hendricks for his shot. Hendricks shot 39% to Walker's 34% and has a better form from long range and potentially has the ability to extend his range where Walker doesn't as much, that being said Jarace has another set of strengths and has a more NBA ready body. 

I've been covering the Stars games for this sub and Hendricks had a rough start but quickly turned it around once he got confident, I said it with Ochai but like Ochai (and now even Simone a bit) a lot of his positives won't be shown on the stat sheet. Hendricks would stay with his man and force a turnover or force a tough shot which would lead the Stars into a transition bucket. With the Stars Hendricks turned into a massive impact piece and even on games where he'd have 2-4 blocks they never told the full story of just how much of a defensive impact he was. 

After watching the Donovan/Rudy led Jazz struggle to guard the perimeter and give up 370000 corner 3s and lanes to the hoop by bringing Gobert out to help, Taylor looks like a savior being built up here, I like the idea of starting Key with Ochai, Lauri, Taylor and Kessler especially with the potential development there and the defensive potential is immense. 

Last game he had a couple (nearly 3 but one got waived off) blocks which were hype, but the one play that went overlooked was when he switched onto Toumani Camara (correct me if I'm wrong the highlights aren't showing the play so I'm basing off of memory), and Camara couldn't get anywhere with him and he'd force the turnover leading into a fast break THT layup. The blazers actively avoided Hendricks on that end and he kept them from really attempting anything most plays. Ironically enough when he checked out Utah's lead fell off leading to overtime, shout-out to Yurt and Simone for holding things together. 

A 6'10 mobile defender who can guard in and out, can play 3' 4 and 5 and has the potential to guard not only 2-5 but some 1-5 is not someone who can be overlooked.

2024-07-16,1721150255,"I found a comprehensive Google sheet with the top 109 draft prospects from the draft. Here are some interesting things I found with Cody, Collier and Kyle.","
First off, the rankings were created by averaging 7 credible big boards. With this in mind Cody Williams was ranked 9th on average, Isaiah Collier was 18th, and Kyle Filipowski was 20th. 3 guys in the top 20 on average isn't half bad!

Collier ranked 16th in the draft based on total assists per game, and quite a bit higher if you eliminate the players who were not drafted. Kyle Filipowski surprisingly ranked 38th on the assists as well, 3rd if you only count Power forwards. Cody was 68th, not a great passer.

Isaiah Collier and Cody Williams ranked 7th and 8th in the in the 3/4 Court Sprint, not everyone did this workout but still these two are highly ranked in terms of quickness in this draft. Kyle finished 36th overall but 4th among Power forwards.

Cody WIlliams is the 15th youngest player in this draft, Collier was the 20th, Kyle was 34th. I thought Kyle would be in the mid 50's due to staying an extra year but he's still relatively average in this draft.

I will say it's shocking to me after looking at all the data here that reed sheppard didn't go number 1. That will be a mistake in about 5 years.

Finally Cody Williams ranked 20th in 3 point percentage, Kyle ranked 57th, and Collier came in at 65th. Don't expect these guys to be sharp shooters, Cody has a chance to be a good 3 point shooter but not great. the other two just were not drafted to be great shooters from 3.

2024-03-03,1709496595,"Not to be a downer but to all those asking what the path forward is, the answer is get LUCKY","Watching the Dallas 76ers game today has really got me thinking about how competitive the west is. Dallas has one top 10 player, a semi all-star second man a decent supporting cast, is above 500 and they are currently in the play-in.

The west is going to be competitive for a long time OKC, Denver, and The Kings are definitely going to be competitive for the next bit, they have strong talent and a good core.

The Clippers, Phoenix, New Orleans, and Memphis are going to be play off competitive for a while barring massive trades and big change ups  


Dallas if they convince Luka to stay will be a play off team as well. The Lakers and Warriors most likely will fall off for a bit, but with their star players will still be in the play in for the next 2-3 years,

Houston went from a really bad team to a solid play in contender with young talent.

All this to say yes we have a solid young coach, some solid talented young players, a semi all-star, and a crazy amount of picks. We are in a decent spot for a rebuild and become a play off team again but to clear that hump and make it to the Championship we will have to be patient and get incredibly lucky.",UtahJazz,20,https://www.reddit.com/r/UtahJazz/comments/1b5qmsu/not_to_be_a_downer_but_to_all_those_asking_what/

Dude is working with a team that any coach, let alone a young coach would be having problems dealing with.

Look at our bench now its made up of former G-Leaguers, rookies, one year contracts and KO.

Maybe I am not as disappointed in will hardy because I thought we could potentially be a playin team. So while I didnt think we would be this bad. I knew we werent going far.

2024-05-13,1715605850,It's going to be extremely hard to move Lauri Markkanen this year due to CBA issues so it will be extremely hard to tank.,"1. Lauri Markkanen is looking for a four year max extension. However, the CBA only allows raises in extensions to be 40% over the last year of his contract. The salary cap in 2025-2026 is likely to be $155.1m so a max for a less than 10 year player is $46.53m starting in year 1. Therefore, a player must be making $33.24m or more in 2024-2025 to sign a max extension for 2025-2026.

2. Lauri Markkanen is set to make 18.044m next year. However, after Lauri's contract hits three years old, whoever has him under contract can renegotiate and extend him. This involves the team using their own salary cap space to give a raise to a player for their current year and then extending him for future years. The Jazz did this last year with Clarkson though for different reasons. To renegotiate and extend Markkanen, the Jazz or whoever traded for Markkanen must give him a $15.2m raise this year, using their cap space.

3. Now we get into the timing issues caused by the CBA. If you trade for a player, you can't extend them for at least six months. If you extend a player, you cannot trade them for at least six months. You must hit the salary floor by mid October. Lauri signed his current contract August 27th 2021. The trade deadline is early February 2025.

4. The salary floor is 90% of the cap, meaning that a team can only pass mid October with $14.1m in cap space or less.

  
So let's go through a few scenarios here.

1. Jazz renegotiate and extend Markkanen. In this scenario, the Jazz cannot have renegotiated and extended him until August 27th, 2024 or later. This means they could not trade Markkanen until February 27th, 2025... Which is after the trade deadline.

2. The Jazz do not renegotiate and extend Markkanen and try to trade him to a team with cap space that promises to renegotiate and extend him. In this scenario, a team could hypothetically offer Markkanen a $14.1m raise this year and a near max contract. Over the five years, this would lose Markkanen around $8m compared to a renegotiation and max so Markkanen's agent would realistically try to harm trade talks unless an absolutely perfect situation came up. And what teams could realistically hold this much cap space available for renegotiation and extending? It's mostly just the Pistons and Spurs so Markkanen's agent would probably tell the Pistons that he would rather test free agency because the Pistons are so awful (and this is actually pretty reasonable for a player to say as well, lol). This narrows Markkanen's market and reduces his trade value.

3. The Jazz do not renegotiate and extend Markkanen and try to trade him to a team that will not renegotiate and extend him. This move would cost Markkanen at least $15m and would cause a huge amount of risk for Markkanen if he got injured during next season so he and agent would try to sabotage any trade talks to non ideal situations by implying that he could leave in free agency. I would say this narrows down his market to basically just title contenders where he would fit well and get a good amount of shots. If you narrow that down to teams that have assets, you're basically just left with the 76ers, Thunder... Maybe the Lakers? Maybe the Heat if they trade Butler? Maybe the Nets if Mitchell demands a second star player to come with him? And all of these teams will likely be more wary of giving up 4+ picks still because Lauri won't be able to extend with them.

  
So we're looking at a very narrow trade market and that lowers the odds dramatically that a team will want to roll the dice and go all-in with Markkanen, making the odds of trading him much lower.

Sexton and Kessler also have depressed trade value (Sexton due to his seasons before this not being great and Kessler for having a disappointing second year) so they're unlikely to be traded as well though they could be traded at the deadline if they have a great year. These are our three best players so it's hard to see any tanking moves being plausible.",UtahJazz,53,https://www.reddit.com/r/UtahJazz/comments/1cqyxyy/its_going_to_be_extremely_hard_to_move_lauri/

2024-02-10,1707588348,An honest take on the trade deadline madness,"I, like many others, was absolutely perplexed by what happened on Thursday. However, given time to cool off and after watching the game the other night, I have come to terms with the moves that were made. 

First, the players that were traded:

Simone - I love Simone and I personally think that he could have been part of the future of this team. After waiving Knox it became clear that this trade was literally Simo for an early SRP. 

Ochai - This one hurt the most for me, personally, because I thought Ochais ceiling was much higher than what we saw even last year, but I see the argument that he was having a really tough year. 

Kelly - this one hurts the team more than the others because he was arguably one of the better players on the team. His facilitating and shooting will be poorly missed. But while Kelly was playing, Taylor was not and I think the FO really wanted to get him some solid minutes. 

Ultimately, did the Jazz get better? Of course not. But can they stay good enough to be in the play-in hunt by the end of the season? I think so. I think what youre getting defensively from Taylor counteracts the offense that youre losing from Kelly (remember [his block on KD](https://youtube.com/shorts/o_TLGxA6BUQ?si=Rmp5a-hVp-iPUD7t) the other night?) Simone had really tapered off after his hot start and Ochai was struggling all around, though Id argue thats due to the rotation he was a part of. And who knows, maybe Otto Porter comes in and resurrects his career too. 

I also think running a 9 man rotation rather than a 10 man is going to benefit the team as a whole. 



I dont think I would have made the moves that were made, but Im also not a professional GM, so& theres probably a reason for that.

2024-08-02,1722559499,Hot Take: I am excited for this season,"I think this Jazz season will be a fun combination of watching our young team and scouting future draft picks. I know most will disagree with me, but here's why I am looking forward to it. 

1- The roster is already bad enough to tank, even with it looking more and more likely that the Jazz keep Lauri. This is the same roster that was among the absolute worst in the league after the trade deadline last year, except we got rid of our best perimeter defender on an already awful defense (Dunn). With some well timed nagging injuries and resting, I think that the Jazz will be plenty bad. 

2- That said, with the flat lottery odds, we don't have to be the worst of all. We just have to be in that bottom 5 or so to ensure that we have a good chance at a top pick. 

3- Extremely importantly, in conjunction with those two above, it sounds like the Jazz themselves know that they need to tank. Tony Jones said to expect the team to do whatever they need to in order to get a top pick, especially playing young players. 

4- What will make it actually fun, though, is that we have some fun young players! I am excited to see what Keyonte has added to his game and how Cody Williams looks in real NBA minutes. I think all of our young guys will be great to cheer for, even with the team losing. This in addition to Lauri himself being super fun to watch. 

5- In a recent interview, Tony made it sound like Lauri is on board with the rebuild, and wants to stick around anyhow. TBH, this should help the locker room a ton, having your best player ok with it, similar to SGA the last few years in OKC. 

6- This draft is awesome. It is not just Cooper Flagg. Ace Bailey, VJ Edgecombe, Nolan Traore, Dylan Harper, Tre Johnson, etc., are all awesome prospects, and I am looking forward to watching them. Getting any one of them would be a huge win for the Jazz. They don't need the #1 pick for this to be a successful year. 

Anyhow, I know that this is probably a hot take, but that is why I am looking forward to this upcoming season. What do you think? Is there anything you are looking forward to this year? ",UtahJazz,8,https://www.reddit.com/r/UtahJazz/comments/1ehws4p/hot_take_i_am_excited_for_this_season/

2024-06-23,1719161951,A Year of Patience,"After relentlessly following the mock drafts, scouting reports, recent (mostly terrible) trade and free agent speculation, and having a sober look at our roster, I have come to the conclusion that we should do... almost nothing.


Sure, we need to see if we can get value for Clarkson and move off Collins if the opportunity presents itself. We need to renegotiate and extend Lauri.


As for the draft, we are going to get a player who would likely be a post lottery prospect in any other draft. Hendricks would probably go top 3 in this class. There may be a good player at 10, hopefully the front office knows something I don't. I would prefer Tidjane, Williams, Knecht, or Holland respectively from what I can tell. None of those guys should affect our long term decision making process. Maybe we move up. Maybe we move down. Regardless, this is not the year to use the draft assets we got from Rudy, Donovan, and Conley.


The hard truth is that we will likely be the 14th +/- best team in the West next year - with or without Lauri. Portland has a pretty good young team with a lot of depth and they might be a tough out, so we could easily be last place. I expect San Antonio to get better along with Houston. Every other team is wildly out of reach barring a blow up.


Having said all that, it isn't necessarily terrible news. We have a lot of players who could use the development. Hendricks and George could be great. Maybe Brice too. Kenny could be a great find. Kessler needs to get minutes, he could easily rebound and be a foundational piece. Sexton had a damn good season last year. Lauri could get better for the next 7 years.


We just need to be patient and see what we have. If there is a move to be made, make it next year after drafting in a significantly stronger class.",UtahJazz,32,https://www.reddit.com/r/UtahJazz/comments/1dmqpyi/a_year_of_patience/
2024-06-17,1718632270,Why does it seem like everyone wants to trade Sexton? ,"Seems like everyone wants to trade him. 

I think it's a mistake. He is a very good player. His main knock was efficiency, but he grew immensely this year in that department. He is maybe not the strongest defender, but he is high- motor and makes big things happen in clutch moments. 

Even if he is just average as far as nba talent, though, I think his energy and passion is impossible to replace. He is a perfect 6th man for when a team needs a spark. You put him in and the energy of the game changes. He gets excited when he makes a big stop and his energy is contagious. 

I just don't see the big need to trade him. I think he's good for the culture of our team. He's good on the court. He's a positive role model in the community. I'd love to have him around for his whole career. ",UtahJazz,58,https://www.reddit.com/r/UtahJazz/comments/1dhyks2/why_does_it_seem_like_everyone_wants_to_trade/
2024-05-12,1715547026,over reaction ,"Seems to be a whole lot of over reaction right now for falling two picks in what is considered to be a very weak draft.  Obviously getting 1st would be really neat but where this draft is being compared to 2013 there' aren't any stand out, no brain picks.  

Role players and what not will still be able to be found at 10 just as likely as they would have been at 10.  Keyonte was 16th last year and performed perfectly fine. Last years 8th pick was Jarace Walker who has had 0 impact this season on the Pacers while 10 was Cason Wallace who may not be killing it for OKC but still has made playing time on the 1 seed in the west.  

I understand, there's some people out there who will want to use this as more reason as to why we should have traded Lauri, Sexton, and everyone else worth anything for picks and hard tanked, but we are still in a significantly better place right now with our team than a team like the Pistons who has had the best chance at the 1st pick 2 years in a row and came with the 5th.

2024-04-15,1713140911,Taking Inventory of the Jazz,"Now that the season is over, we can fully look at the roster and make some notes. These are just my observations.

# The Players

Keyonte - Genuine future of the team. Would've been a top 3 rookie in most other classes, but 2023 is stacked. I'm interested in his position going forward, as he seems more comfortable as a scoring threat than a playmaker. I hope he can develop defensively in the future. NOTE: If you see Keyonte size up a defender beyond the arc, he **will** make the shot.

Sexton - Arguably our second-best player. Consistently scored with solid efficiency, had plenty of hustle, and got the team through some tough games. Is this his ceiling, or does he still have more to do?

Lauri - Obviously still our best player, but injuries still weigh him down. He didn't really improve a lot, but he proved that his last season wasn't a fluke either. I still don't know if we should keep him or not, the interest seems high, but I don't want to think about what this team is without him.

Hendricks - Maybe this draft class has spoiled me, but I didn't think he was that impressive. Still has a high ceiling due to his physical tools. Hope he gets more touches and playing time next year.

Collins - Despite the contract, he impressed me this year. Solid scorer and rebounder, but I wish he didn't take minutes away from Kessler. Was the only bright spot in several games after the all-star break. Probably not a long-term piece though.

Kessler - Most disappointing player this year. He somewhat felt like the same player he was last year. Any development on offense would go a long way, especially free throw shooting. Maybe he can break out of the bench. Also, does anyone feel like the coach keeps him on a short leash? Some players on this team just get thrown out there no matter what, but he has to work for his minutes.

Clarkson - I don't know how I feel here. On one hand, at some points of the season, it felt like he was getting 30 minutes no matter what, even though more of Sexton, Keyonte, or even Dunn would be appreciated. Especially in those first two weeks of the season. But on the other hand, he still is extremely talented. Especially in those *second* two weeks of the season. I think the time to trade him is here though, especially if we draft another guard this year.

Dunn - Our only option defensively at guard. Although his chances of earning the award are low, he should be on an all-defensive team. Over 30, his time on the team is limited, but I wouldn't be against keeping him around another year.

Talen Horton-Tucker. Boneheaded drives to the basket led to the worst true shooting percentage on this team from anyone not named Luka (or Jason Preston but he doesn't count). Hopefully, this is the last year we have to live with you shot-chucking your way to another contract, but I'm not sure. Why couldn't it have been you instead of Ochai.

Sensabaugh - Easily my favorite player on the team right now. Maybe I'm biased, but I think his ceiling is higher than everyone except Keyonte. Another year of development without a sophomore slump will go a long way. 

Yurtseven - Was a solid reserve center, but I could be wrong, as every memory I have of him playing basketball this year was erased from my head. Someone else talk about him.

Samanic - Not impressed with him. I could imagine the team resigning him to give him more time, but with so much other talent in the league, I think it's time to move on.

Kira Lewis - Doesn't seem like a long-term piece. Older than Horton-Tucker but less talented, I doubt we keep him around.

KENNETH LOFTON JR - The best part of the late-season tank. If he's already this skilled after only two years in the NBA and G-League, I think we should guarantee his contract for the next year at least. At the very least, a solid bench big and off-ball playmaker. And I know this sounds crazy, and it probably is, but if this team gets competitive in the next few years when Wemby and Chet are dominating the league, he could be our way of defeating them.

Bazley - I say we give him another round. He's had success in the league before and seemed solid, so why not go again? Unless we draft another big, then ditch him.

Juzang - I can wholeheartedly say he deserves an NBA contract, especially over THT. Great shooter and scorer, could be the next Niang or Ingles. Are we just an undrafted sharpshooter factory for the rest of the league?

Potter - Bored of him. He had one game that impressed me watching him (the lone win over Atlanta), but nothing else. Not a long-term piece.

Preston - Low sample size, but I think his impact was solid. As far as two-ways go, he deserves another year.

# The Draft

8, 29, and 32 are our lucky numbers this year assuming no jumps. I know everyone else says this, but Stephon Castle would be perfect on this team. If we draft him, I'd say he replaces Dunn in the rotation at least. A starting 5 of Castle, Keyonte, Markkanen, Hendricks, and Collins/Kessler sounds appealing. But if we don't jump, I doubt we get him. Reed Sheppard impresses me a lot. He's only 6'3"" but he plays a lot taller. He gets these improbable tips and blocks that I don't see often. Not a bad choice if we don't get Castle. I also think that despite his stock falling, Risacher could be a solid pickup as a sort of Fontecchio replacement. IF we jump I don't know who we should take, especially if we get the 1st pick. Sarr is probably the best player, but he definitely doesn't fit into our already crowded frontcourt (we already can't play Kessler consistently). Topic I'm open to, but he hasn't shown much on defense and I don't think we need any more offense-only players. Taking any other player first just feels wrong. My hope is we get the second or third pick and take Castle there.

# The Spots

We only have enough slots for 15 players and 3 two-way players. If we keep all three rookies (we better, or else the great sacrifice of Fontecchio was in vain), we need to lose three players, potentially more if we want any undrafted players on the team.

Easily Safe: Lauri, Keyonte, Sexton, Hendricks, Sensabaugh

Safe: Kessler, Lofton, Juzang

Tradable: Collins, Clarkson, Dunn. These guys only leave if we trade them, as I can't imagine us buying them out.

Unsafe: Yurtseven, Lewis Jr, Bazley, Preston, Potter

Your Days are Numbered: THT, Samanic

THT and Samanic are most definitely out the door, and Preston and Potter don't count. That leaves one more player leaving at least, most likely either Yurtseven or Lewis. Lewis is a restricted free agent while Yurtseven is on a non-guaranteed contract. Between the two of them, I think Lewis is most likely to go, as our guard rotation is already crowded. This is barring any trades from our veterans.

# The Tank

Hopefully, this is the last season we aren't competitive (post-deadline). Because I don't know how much more I can tank. The expectation versus reality of tanking is truly miserable, and if I'm this exhausted after year two, I might go insane before we get competitive. The only thing I ask is that if we want to tank next year for Cooper Flagg, do it from the beginning. If this deadline ends with us standing in a play-in position then trading Clarkson for a mid-first-round pick and Lauri in some package deal for whatever OKC throws our way, I'm hunting down Danny Ainge.

The team does better than expected so they decide to keep it going to boost trade value. Maybe a potential all star will come on the market. Doesnt happen, and turns out that even with a decent record the pieces that we have to move arent as valuable as we thought they would be. So they sell what they can and try to acquire more capital that they can draft or trade.

Dare I say maybe the 2nd brightest future outside of OKC who's going to be incredible for years to come. Orlando, Indiana and a few others are close. 

Do I wish Utah could've gotten more for Conley/Vando/NAW/Malik at last year's deadline? Yes, and it's a valid criticism, but at pick 9 Utah got a really important piece and I really like what Taylor Hendricks is capable of and I think there's a good possibility him and Keyonte are going to be some of the best to come out of this draft class. 

Still having 12 first round picks to use over the next 6 years is opening up possibilities in the long run and the fact Markkanen actually wants to stay is a damn blessing. Some of the guys are turning into legitimate pieces, Sexton is a fighter, Ochai and Hendricks are the defensive potential that the 2021 team needed, Kessler is becoming an interior force quickly. Somehow Dunn and Fonteccio have been effective role players coming out of far inferior leagues recently.

2024-07-27,1722082837,Curious on yalls thoughts on this,"Ill save some suspense and start off with: unless Utah gets a true godfather offer, I do not think they should or will trade Lauri Markkanen.

Depending on who you ask hes a top ~25 player in the league, adaptable to play either as a wing or a big (rebounding included), and can thrive off ball while also capable of being the focal point of an offense for stretches. More importantly hes still only 27 this year, seems like a guy whos gonna age great, and **actually wants to play in Utah** which is a pretty rare trait in this league.

The common talking point as to why Utah has to trade him is because they lack direction and need to pick a lane for the future. While he seems as if hed be a perfect fit for a Utah team looking to build a winner, what they need to prioritize is finding that tier 1 star who you can actually win with. And while I dont necessarily disagree with this (Lauri is certainly not *that* guy), I simply reject the notion that you must first rid a team of all their talent before finding a potential superstar.

The argument for trading Lauri generally revolves around the idea that you need a top pick to find that guy and by keeping a great player like him youre limiting yourself to later picks (Utah selected 9 and 10 the last 2 seasons). Even if we ignore the fact that superstars like Jokic, Giannis, and Shai (and blooming stars like Hali, Bam, Maxey, Doma, and Sengun) were all drafted 11th or later and that Utahs massive war chest gives near top priority in trading for a superstar (like when AD, Paul George, Kawhi, or Harden got traded in recent years)&

**I really dont think keeping Lauri takes them out of consideration for a top pick**

To say the west is deep this year would be an understatement. *Literally* the only 2 teams not trying to win games this year are Portland and Utah and (depending on how you evaluate the Spurs) all 13 other squads are effectively playoff teams in terms of talent. Even with Lauri, Utah is all but locked into 2nd worst in the west.

I dont care how bad teams like Brooklyn, Washington, Detroit, Charlotte, Toronto, Chicago, and Atlanta are (fwiw I dont even think the last 4 are *that* bad)& just given the unbalanced nature of the conference schedules, they will not all have a worse record than Utah.

Since the NBA expanded to 30 teams, never has 1 conference had 6 teams worse than the 2nd worst team in the other. Only twice has there ever been 5 worse teams. History tells us that so long Utah is the 2nd worst team in the west& which they clearly are& the absolute worst lotto odds they could have are 7th and even that is incredibly unlikely. Their likely spots are either 5th or 6th with a big 4 of Brooklyn, Washington, Detroit, and Portland vying for the worst  records. **Even if they do trade Lauri**, all 4 of those teams are so bad its really no guarantee theyd even be able to out-tank any of them and they could still easily end up with the 5th odds.

Now lets look at what these actual lottery odds are with the NBA flattening it out a few years back:

1-3: 14%

4: 12.5%

5: 10.5%

6: 9%

7: 7.5%

The absolutely improbable worst case scenario while keeping Lauri is only 6.5% worse odds than the absolute best case scenario of trading him, the more probable worse case scenario is only 5% worse odds. 

Far more likely the difference between trading him or not would be only 3.5%, 2%, 1.5%, or even legitimately 0% with them finishing in 5th in either scenario.

In my opinion, these genuinely tiny differences in odds are why Utah should not (and probably do not) feel pressured to trade him for anything less than a crazy offer. Theyre gonna suck either way and have fairly similar lotto odds either way, so might as well keep a building block of your future rather than have to find a number 2 ***as well as*** a number 1 guy& all while being in the least desirable market in the league.

This was the NBAs exact goal when they flatted the lottery odds. For teams that are already at ground zero like Brooklyn and Washington, might as well tank hard and hope for a top pick , but teams that already have a head start with some talented players (and a deep war chest) arent gonna feel pressured to do the same and risk setting their team even further back if they dont get lottery luck. This keeps stars on bad teams longer and fans of those teams more engaged as they still have legit players to root for and build with. Thats exactly what Utahs doing with Lauri.",UtahJazz,24,https://www.reddit.com/r/UtahJazz/comments/1edf3tq/curious_on_yalls_thoughts_on_this/
2024-06-27,1719523587,What we're getting with Filipowski,"Kyle Filipowski

7'0"" 230 Stretch 5, Duke

* **The Good**
   * Filipowski is a naturally talented big standing 7'0"" who is quite quick and athletic for a guy his size.
   * Has a positive assist to turnover ratio which is not always common with centers
   * Shown an ability to make 3's shooting a decent 35% from range. Seems legit taking almost 4 attempts a game and having a decent 67% free throw percentage
   * Above average at his size in assists and steals.
* **The Bad**
   * He has a negative wingspan at 6'10"" and standing at 7'0""
   * A below-average rebounder and shot blocker for a guy his size
   * His field goal percentage is low for a center, still respectable 57% true shooting. This is likely mostly due to his range and 3-point shooting
* **The Concerning**
   * There's a weird situation following Filipowski:
      * During the ESPN broadcast after the draft it was mentioned that GMs were concerned about his girlfriend. It was quickly clowned on but come to find out it's a genuine concern. There is little information about it but from what I could find, it looks like a grooming situation. She's between 6-8 years older than he is and apparently accompanied him to his high school prom.

      * It has also been reported that Filipowski is no longer in contact with his parents or family.
      * **Why does this matter?** Simply put, his character and possible drama that can follow him. It's not his fault completely for being groomed, but the family part raises some questions. I don't know to what extent, but apparently it's big enough to affect his draft stock as many GMs had him going mid-late 1st round before the rumors started swirling.
   * Back to basketball:
      * Kyle's wingspan has led to below-average shot blocking for a big of his size.
      * He's been timid in the low post which despite almost 10 rebounds per 36, is slightly below-average for someone of his size. His finishing in the post has also been a question mark.
      * He needs to put on more muscle as right now he has a hard time scoring at the rim when faced with other guys his size.
* **The Intriguing**
   * Seems to have solid ability on both ends of the court, especially if he is able to put on some more muscle, he'll be able to finish and protect the paint to an impressive level
   * Solid BBIQ, feel and seeming passion for the game are three traits that you can't teach. Assuming he doesn't get discouraged, I don't see his floor being very low. He projects at minimum to be a really solid backup big for years to come.
   * If his shooting translates and he's able to shoot at a higher percentage from deep, his offense has the potential to be elite.
* **Player Comps**
   * **High Level:** 80% of Jokic's ability on offense (minus passing) &amp; 75% of Rudy Gobert's ability on Defense, High-level starter, sub all-star
   * **Medium/Realistic:** Kelly Olynyk, respectable starter-6th Man
   * **Low Level:** 2nd Year Santi Aldama, 8th man/backup big",UtahJazz,12,https://www.reddit.com/r/UtahJazz/comments/1dq2n3v/what_were_getting_with_filipowski/

While there was originally league-wide skepticism that the Hornets would be able to retain Bridges this summer, Charlottes newfound flexibility, creating as much as $45 million in upcoming cap space by dealing Rozier, could push an interested team in trading for him now, as opposed to leaving Bridges available to re-sign with the only NBA club hes known.",UtahJazz,96,https://www.reddit.com/r/UtahJazz/comments/1abmvmr/fischer_utah_jazz_explores_buying_and_selling/

2024-10-11,1728659701,The Jazz might still be too good to tank properly,"I honestly can't decide which side of the fence I am on. 

On one hand, I really like watching the Jazz do really well. Even though no deep playoff run came of it, the Donovan/Rudy team was so much fun to watch because they were just a good basketball team.

On the other hand, I definitely understand the need to prep for the future, up to and including a high draft pick this upcoming draft. 

  
However, I honestly am not sure if the team can reasonably do it. I know team leaders have been very direct in saying that the team will be focusing on developing young players but the crazy thing is that over the offseason, our young players seemed to really find themselves. Johnny is looking like mini JC, IC looks super solid on both sides, Key looks like Key, Brice looks good, Walker looks strong, Taylor looks way more out of his head than last year, Flip and Cody are looking nice.

On top of that, Lauri is next level, JC can light up whenever, Collin and John are still really good, NBA-starter caliber players, Drew Eubanks has looked legit in the preseason, Patty proved in the Olympics that he's not done yet... 

  
Now, don't get me wrong. If last night was a regular season game in Dallas with Luka, the Jazz would have lost. But I just don't think the Jazz will end up being one of the bottom 4 teams in the league unless they ship off some combo of JC, John or Collin and Lauri has fits of ""back spasms"".

Posted in /r/nba here https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/1fxsxqf/stein_before_coming_to_terms_on_a_blockbuster/

The weird thing is that they've traded their picks to Brooklyn in 2025, 2027, 2029, 2031, so they can't trade anything via the Stepien rule. The other big issue with their picks is that they're likely to be mediocre at best, since that roster is built pretty solidly (more so if they got Walker).

I think us ""want[ing]"" at least two future first-round picks is Danny's polite way of telling them to fuck off because they don't even have two firsts to give. They could trade their pick swaps, but I don't think those would have any value.

One of the comments mentioned that if the Knicks actually found two firsts, they would have been (1) the Detroit pick that ended up in the KAT trade that will likely become one SRP and (2) the Washington pick that will likely become 2 SRPs (2026 and 2027).

In the most optimistic world we would be battling the tenth seed with GS in a realistic state I think we would be in the 11th seed with the slight of hope of getting the 10th.

Then in the offseason Tech and KO most likely would have asked for larger contracts, and would have signed with other teams with getting nothing in return.

He may already be the best point guard on our team (everyone else is a shooting guard forced to facilitate when they just want to gun). Id like to see him touch the ball more, even when Keyonte is on the floor. I have no problem with Keyonte taking the tough shots and scoring 30 ppg, but I would like to see him involved more.

His defense actually was better than I expected and of the three Rookies, he is the player I expect to see Jazz minutes this season as a backup PG (even if he starts the year with the Stars).

Fans should basically have zero expectations for them outside of SLC Stars action. Both look way small compared to NBA players, and both need more time getting used to the NBA 3-pt line. They both showed good flashes, but were mostly non-existent. Id wait to see how Kyle looks next summer before freaking out about him. Williams may need fans to temper expectations until rookie year 3.


#Walker Kessler

Kessler had a fine SL and basically did what you expected him to do. The steal and transition dunk was fun. For people saying he got beat by Edey, that says more about Edey (who looks like a fucking monster and is going to dominate regular season play next to Ja, JJJ, Smart, and Bane). Well see how real these trades rumors are, but I think Kesslers NBA role really might just be 15-20 minutes a night. And thats okay (and still a steal at 22 where he was drafted).


#Taylor Hendricks

Looked passive in game one. Ramped up the assertiveness in game three and had a terrific game for it. I loved what I saw from Hendricks in game 3. Took shots, aggressively rebounded and played tough Defense. Also had a nice highlight dunk.


#Keyonte George

Averaged 30.5 ppg in the two games he played. Not incredibly efficient games, but he found his way to the line and helped us win both games he was playing. He needs to get better at finishing, though I am glad to see he is getting better at baiting and drawing fouls. Defense still needs a little work  Collier already seems ahead of him there. 


#Darius Bazely and Kenny Lofton Jr

Both have done enough to keep themselves on the roster for now. Bazely is a willing roleplayer and Kenny is an overall positive when he plays. He was the only player with positive +\- in a blowout loss of game 2, and he played over 30 minutes and stuffed the stat sheet. I think they were hoping he could defend centers better, but his calling is point forward/fan favorite. You could find way worse guys as your 12th man.

League personnel told Yahoo Sports the Bucks are open to reshaping their roster, and they are gauging the trade value for Brook Lopez. Houston, sources said, cautioned Lopez that re-signing with Milwaukee could very well lead to him eventually being traded when the Rockets pursued Lopez in free agency a year ago. Atlanta, sources said, continues to pursue deals for veteran center Clint Capela, whos entering the final year of a contract that still owes the 30-year-old rim protector $22 million.

The way he said it just made me realize how ignorant and smooth brained he really is. He had no examples of racial situations he or anybody on his team had ever experienced here. He literally just said utah is full of racists because when you play there....all you see are white people in the crowd. His logic was embarrassing tbh.

Idk it just really grinded my gears that someone at his level would just freely throw out claims like that without having personally dealt with anything actually racist in utah.

2024-07-26,1722023998,Zach Lowe podcast info,"Zach Lowe had Tim MacMahon on to talk about the Western Conference, with a focus on the Jazz and Pelicans.

Jazz related stuff

1. MacMahon says the offers the Jazz have received are nowhere close to what Ainge wants and they will likely just renegotiate and extend Markkanen.
2. MacMahon believes Markkanen will sign after August 6th to avoid having to hear trade talk during the season.
3. Lowe seems baffled by the Jazz's offseason and approach, says they need to pick a lane. MacMahon agrees that they really need to tank but thinks the Jazz can probably tank if they just flood the very young players with minutes and touches. They talk about trading Sexton etc as well to better tank.
4. Lowe questions why Markkanen would want to be a part of another tanking season and MacMahon says the Jazz feel like they're in no rush to do anything and can discuss summer 2025 about whether to trade Markkanen or try to be good. Markkanen will probably just take the money now and can discuss with the Jazz in summer 2025 about whether they should tank together again, try to be good, or look to trade him.
5. Lowe says the Jazz were AGGRESSIVELY after Mikal Bridges, he doesn't really seem to understand why.
6. Lowe says an NBA insider was talking to him, wondering if the Jazz could trade for Brandon Ingram if no Markkanen trade emerges. Lowe seems in disbelief at how bad New Orleans' roster is and how none of it works or fits together. They need to trade Ingram for a  center, but MacMahon has heard nothing in weeks. They tried to trade Ingram to get Jarrett Allen, but the Cavs refuse to trade Jarrett Allen under basically any realistic circumstances.",UtahJazz,55,https://www.reddit.com/r/UtahJazz/comments/1ecxf0f/zach_lowe_podcast_info/
2024-04-27,1714253286,First round has changed my mind,"Originally, before we made the trades this season, I was on board for trying to play for a play-in/playoff spot this season to get some of our young guys experience.  I understood the reason's they made the trades and mostly agreed with the reasoning, but I still wanted to believe that we were a good enough team to make a little noise.  But seeing how the first 3 games of these have gone for the 3 bottom seeds, as well as seeing GS and the Kings not make it I've been convinced once again that I am a fan for a reason and belong no where near the decision making for the team! 

Its pretty apparent that OKC, Minnesota, and Denver are really just a tier of their own in the west and I'm glad that we won't have to watch our young guys get bullied around like i'm seeing these other teams.  Ultimately I really do want to see them succeed, but seeing how these games aren't even close I'm glad that Ainge continues to preach the idea of being flexible and making the call to push for another top 10 pick this season.

2024-07-15,1721029011,Unapologetically jumping the gun on this years rookies,"I understand that summer league doesn't hold stock and we won't know where we're at until October, but that win against the Mavs in Vegas got me excited for these rookies man. Down the line, Williams, Collier, and Filipowski all played fantastic and most importantly they looked like they are starting to get comfortable with the pace and with each other. 

I know it's just summer league, but that game felt like a really strong step in the right direction as far as their development goes, Obviously Cody with 21 points on 9-15 is the main focus, finally decided to just start dunking that shit everytime, making his threes and jumpers, and it's like YEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAH HELL YEAAAAAAAAAAAAAH, if he turns out to be even a little bit better than his brother than the Jazz will be contenders in the near future. 

Collier is the PG of the future man, I have not seen or heard one thing about this man since being drafted that has made me doubt him, he is a DAWG and that is what you want on your team. Amazing passing sense and abilities, while still maintaining that ATTACK instinct on both sides of the ball he's a 6'3 210 pound machine and I love watching him play, I need Hardy to understand that Keyonte is a SG that has been forced to play PG and start him as a 2 so that IC can develop. Also idk anything about his USC days but I wanna hear Bowler and Big T start calling him ICU or ""PUT HIM IN THE ICU"" when he scores or makes a sweet pass or something. You cannot tell me that nickname don't go hard.

Finally Filipowski showed me that he is a 5 through and through, they had him playing PF with Kessler and it became very clear that he is much more comfortable playing the 5, which with his size and skills that's an irrefutable asset. At the very least he is a solid back up 5/ Insurance if Kessler is traded, and at his peak he is our new 5 going forward. I don't have as much to say about Flip simply because I don't see him as that big of an X factor for us, what he brings to the table isn't something that nobody else on the jazz can't currently do, but if he can find a way to become a 12 and 8 guy on a nightly basis with good efficiency that would be juuuuuuuuuuust peachy.",UtahJazz,22,https://www.reddit.com/r/UtahJazz/comments/1e3oxmb/unapologetically_jumping_the_gun_on_this_years/

Do the Jazz try and shop the pick? Portland has picks at 2 and 13. Toronto has 4 and 17.

After slipping in the draft for several years are the Pistons desperate enough to bundle 5 and a player to trade up? Is there an established star that we could trade 1 overall for?

My goodness. this one ended in the most unserious fashion I've ever seen it was like they were just screwing around out there. SLC led by 61, SIXTY ONE! I'll jump into the details though. 


-G League Ignite tried. No Buzelis but still had Holland. They occasionally had momentum. That's about it. 

-Sensabaugh: 25 tonight and just continues his offensive dominance in the G League, he is a certified bucket. Turned it over 6 times but made up for it with good passes and even had flashes of ok defense tonight. He's ready on offense. Also had 5 assists and 5 boards

-Hendricks: His game had to be encouraging, just a defensive monster and as the game went on he made less and less mistakes and found a groove on offense, 19 points, 3 blocks, 3 steals, didn't have the best shooting night and turned it over 3 times as well and he had future projected top 3 pick Ron Holland as his matchup and just dominated. Believe in this man. 

-Everyone else looked great, Christopher, Kinsey and Potter all look polished despite the flaws, shout-out to Michael Devoe scoring 21 and Isaiah Miller having some vicious energy out there. Seriously Miller is so much fun.

2024-02-23,1708723940,Seems Like the Jazz are Staying in Salt Lake City,"According to a new bill that passed a Senate Subcommittee, the state Legislature, with support from Salt Lake City Mayor Mendenhall, would create a new separate NHL arena in Salt Lake City.    


[https://www.ksl.com/article/50887025/utahs-nhl-dream-downtown-salt-lake-city-hockey-arena-could-cost-taxpayers-1b](https://www.ksl.com/article/50887025/utahs-nhl-dream-downtown-salt-lake-city-hockey-arena-could-cost-taxpayers-1b)  


In short, the bill would have Salt Lake City raise its tax rate by 0.5% to pay a $1 billion NHL arena over 30 years ([https://le.utah.gov/\~2024/bills/static/SB0272.html](https://le.utah.gov/~2024/bills/static/SB0272.html)).  The tax would only be on Salt Lake City residents.  This is in conjunction with another bill ([https://le.utah.gov/\~2024/bills/static/HB0562.html](https://le.utah.gov/~2024/bills/static/HB0562.html)) that would create a bond the state would pay for, to fund a portion of the River Walk by Jordan River area for the new MLB stadium.    


This affects the Jazz because the state is specifying the NHL arena to be downtown, and the Jazz won't move south to rebuild a co-NBA and NHL arena.  The bill's sponsor Rep McKay said  ""Here we have an Olympics knocking at our door in 2034. We have the NHL and we have the NBA who want to be downtown and Major League Baseball is going to be right close by"".    


The Utah Senate President Stuart Adams said the state wants a Salt Lake City sports district, with the NBA, NHL, and MLB teams all connected and to be close to one another.  The article talks about how the state will look at what buildings near the Delta Center for an NHL arena.   The state would either have to buy out buildings, have some donated to them by the LDS church, or use eminent domain to get enough property.  


I know this is a basketball thread, and not a political one, but the bill's language is a little broad, and says ""Qualifying local government to levy a sales and use tax within the local government's boundaries and for use within the project area"".  The language could be applied to another local government, but the Legislature is dumping all the money and long-term planning into downtown.   
The bummer (depending on where you live) is that the tax is only for those who live in Salt Lake City.  With support from Legislative leadership and the Salt Lake City government leadership, it does seem that this bill and the tax will pass.  

The end result appears to be that the Jazz remain in the Delta Center in Salt Lake City.",UtahJazz,36,https://www.reddit.com/r/UtahJazz/comments/1aycdyx/seems_like_the_jazz_are_staying_in_salt_lake_city/

The Golden State Warriors have shown the most interest in acquiring Markkanen.

The Warriors proposed a deal including Moses Moody, multiple first-round picks, pick swaps, and second-round picks.

The Jazz demanded more from the Warriors, including Jonathan Kuminga, Brandin Podziemski, and additional picks, which has been a non-starter for Golden State.

2023-11-12,1699765926,SLC Stars lose to the Santa Cruz Warriors 115-129 after coming back from 20 down then going back down 20 (recap),"It's G league but with multiple first round picks playing I had to watch this game and surprisingly there was a lot to take away! Kinda hard to find individual plays to link here so I'll have to just discuss them as best I can. 

First off, Hendricks: He was sick and barely played, looked absolutely winded just minutes into the game, Andy Larsen says it's a non covid illness. He had 2 blocks, one being a killer chase down. Didn't get many shots, made a couple questionable decisions but still looked good on the defensive end and fought for a few boards, not much to take away from him. My big takeaway is have tons of patience, he's the guy that Utah is trying to sculpt long term into their best and most versatile defender, and you need guys like him to win in the playoffs. I'm a big believer in him. 

Next up, Christopher: he's got a ton of talent but kind of like Clarkson, THT and Sexton, he sometimes just refuses to pass. Made some tough shots though and he has a deep bag, just tough to see him really making the main roster and getting mins. 

Micah Potter: not a ton to say, he's a streaky shooter and I feel like he hits the backboard on every three he shoots. I like that he's semi quick and sets a decent screen. 

The big takeaway from tonight though and the man of the hour, Brice Sensabaugh: lead the comeback and gave us 27 points on 11-24 shooting, 5-12 from 3, but also 8, yes 8 assists and 8 boards. My goodness he was good tonight, he had some killer reads tonight making the right pass play after play, could've easily gotten over the 10 assist mark. Defensively he's going to need work obviously but even with this being a G league game, have to be happy with what you're seeing from him. 

To continue with Brice, he just looked NBA ready out there tonight, not a lot of mistakes, looked crazy confident with the shot, I'd highly recommend finding some highlights of his if you can along with the Hendricks block. 

Also wanna bring up Taevion Kinsey who didn't shoot great but defensively really showed up, thought he did great in summer league and looked alright for the Jazz in the preseason, I have a feeling he could make his way back into the Jazz roster at some point, just looks a lot better than a lot of the guys out there. 

Anyways, that was a fun time, games are free to watch on NBAgleague.com, not sure if I'll watch all of them but while we've got Hendricks and Sensabaugh on the roster I figured I'd cover some.

2024-03-24,1711308887,The Jazz late tanking strategy is fine and the only reason there's so much complaining is the team is losing. ,"It's not the ""worst draft ever"" however it is a flat draft meaning the gap between 1-10 is nowhere near what it was last year. There are plenty of great potential role players or even quality starters throughout and a handful of guys with pretty high potential to even become a star if they pan out. 

Risacher, Topic, Sarr and Williams may be the top 4 but when you comp them to Stephon Castle, Matas Buzelis, Ja'Kobe Walter and Tidjane Salaun for example, you've got nowhere near the gap you had as you did between Wemby to anyone, or Brandon Miller to say Anthony Black. 

Now I'm not sure if Utah can trade their pick down to select elsewhere on draft day but Ainge did pull off the deal that landed him Tatum and extra assets for Markelle Fultz in 2017 and if Utah somehow jumped top 4 I could see something similar (again I can't remember if he's able to this year) but otherwise that still leaves him with a quality potential asset who could even be dealt down the line. 

The big difference between the Jazz and the bottom teams like Washington, Detroit and Charlotte is those teams have been stuck for years, and Utah, unless they sell more in the off-season, will likely be back where they were pre deadline, Will Hardy has proven he can do a lot with a little. So Utah not being the worst is fine. 

I could understand the frustration if this draft was a really top heavy draft but Utah was able to get a lot of kinks figured out and won a few too many in what I once again called a flat draft, and the Olynyk/Ochai deal landed them what zanik calls ""currency"" in an extra late first, management feels confident they can draft the right guys and in a draft like this, takes a bit of luck but your odds of hitting at 20 might be the same as they are at 30. 

Anyways, just sharing my thoughts, also I did initially hate the Ochai trade but something tells me there could be someone similar but potentially a lot better at 26-29. As for the 2nd rounder you just never know. Utah could still technically fall to 8 if Brooklyn could win some damn games as well but it's looking rough. Start watching guys like Stephon Castle or Tidjane Salaun though, perhaps Matas Buzelis, cause Utah could have a shot at any of them

2024-06-27,1719507160,What we're getting with Williams and Collier,"Last night couldn't have realistically gone any better for us. For such a ""weak"" draft, we landed two of the highest ceiling players without needing to give anything up. Both are under the age of 20 and are likely going to be a bit raw for the first year or two. But even if for some reason neither pan out, it's obvious that the Jazz's front office knows what they're doing with scouting and hit two home runs in terms of value and upside with picks 10 and 29.

**Cody Williams:**  
6'8"" Wing (SG/SF), 190 lbs 19.5 y/o

* **The Good**
   * Cody tested well at the combine, listing great sprint and shuttle numbers
   * He has a positive wingspan at 7'1"" standing 6'8""
   * Cody was an efficient scorer with a true shooting percentage of 62% which is the 4th best in this class behind Reed Sheppard, and 2 Centers in Zach Edey and Donovan Clingan 
   * He shows a natural feel for the game, being a decent ball handler and being able to defend and finish near the basket
   * Cody has shown a good level of maturity for his age, and through interviews appears to be a positive locker room presence
   * He fits an immediate need for the Jazz while also being arguably the best player available at pick #10
* **The Bad**
   * Cody has a negative assist-to-turnover ratio showing that he'll be more effective once he can take care of the ball a little better and show better playmaking skills
   * He only shot 71% from the free throw line which isn't horrible, but an indication of his shooting percentages could be being a bit misleading
   * Despite being a decent defender, he only averaged .8 per game in both blocks and steals
   * 4 rebounds/game at his measurements shows that he needs to either get stronger, more aggressive or both
* **The Concerning**
   * Cody's pretty skinny, and is projecting to be taken advantage of when defending until he can bulk up
   * His 3 point percentage is likely misleading, he shot 42% from deep but on only 41 attempts in 24 games
   * He was a bit timid in Colorado, defaulting to the 2nd or 3rd option, though this could be due to him being one of the youngest regular players for Colorado
* **The Intriguing**
   * To say Cody has upside is understating it. Cody's athleticism, defense and shooting all point toward him likely being a safe bet in terms of being at least a decent starter-level player
   * Being the brother of Jalen Williams of the OKC Thunder, Cody is about 2 years ahead of his budding-star brother. Jalen is 2 inches shorter than Cody, they were the same weight at the time they were drafted, and Jalen has put on 20 pounds of muscle in his time in OKC.
      * It's also worth noting that Jalen went to a lower school and he was not draft-ready until his Junior year there. No knock to Jalen, he was a late bloomer and a fantastic NBA player right now. It's *possible* that sharing the same genes, that Cody could start to blossom quite a bit over the next 4 years.
   * Cody's shooting percentage is indication of likely being able to be a good decision-maker on the court already which can boost his playing time with the Jazz year-one
   * The first half of Cody's season with Colorado was quite impressive averaging 14.5 points on 31 minutes played with multiple 20+ point performances. In only his second game with Colorado he had a 17 point, 5 rebound 4 assist 2 block game on 66/100/100 shooting splits in only 25 minutes at the age of 18. Cody got hurt on February 24th in a game against Utah and missed about 3 weeks with an ankle injury. He played 6 more games, his shooting numbers dropping drastically to about 35% FG and 16% from 3 with 6.6ppg in only 20 minutes per game. He seemed to not quite be his same self coming back, this hurt his draft stock from an almost sure-fire top 5 pick down to mid-late lottery.
      * This injury was not surgical and he is appearing to be better at this point with the reports of him ""killing"" his workout with the Jazz a few weeks ago. I think it's quite likely that he wasn't fully healed coming back from that injury and his numbers/play reflected that.

**Isaiah Collier:**  
6'4"" Combo Guard (Leans toward primary ball handler), 205 lbs, 19.7 y/o

* **The Good**
   * A quick, athletic, agile player who was the #1 recruit out of high school in 2023
   * Isaiah showed an ability to finish at the rim and get to the free throw line, with a free-throw rate of getting to the free throw line once for every 2 shots he took.
   * He's built like a tank. 6'4"" with shoes on and 205 lbs means he's likely not going to get bullied and will be able to use his athleticism getting to the hoop with relative ease
   * He joins the Jazz as immediately one of the best if not, the best passer on the team. Despite his turnover issues, his assist-to-turnover rate was positive showing his potential to be an excellent playmaker.
* **The Bad**
   * Collier is a wrecking ball of a player, seeming to act before he thinks sometimes where he averaged 4 turnovers and 3 fouls per 36 minutes on the court.
   * His shooting numbers were concerning despite averaging 16 points in 30 minutes. He shot 34% from deep and only 67% from the free throw line. Not horrible, but also needs some improvement.
   * His defensive rating was higher than his offensive rating which is a red flag. This shows a possible lack of effort on the defensive end.
* **The Concerning**
   * If Isaiah is going to be a consistent impact player in the NBA, he's going to have to improve several key aspects of his game including his shooting, decision making and defensive effort.
   * He had a very consistently concerning year. Some of his best performances were marred by turnovers and fouls. But by-in-large he was consistent, not showing a ton of improvement throughout his single season with USC
   * He's not a good off-ball player on both sides of the court. He doesn't move a lot unless he has the ball, and with his physical qualities, expecting a much better defensive showing isn't unreasonable.
   * There are rumors (none confirmed by reputable sources so take this with a grain of salt) that a reason for his fall was due to poor workouts, interviews and possible attitude concerns (akin to Cam Whitmore last year who dropped from a projected 4-5th overall to 20th).
* **The Intriguing**
   * Isaiah is one of the most intriguing prospects in this draft. The guy is a fierce competitor and hates losing. He has nearly every physical quality you can hope for in a combo-guard. He plays with a chip on his shoulder and seemed to be pretty butthurt on draft night dropping to 29. Many joked that it's because he was drafted to Utah, but the much more likely case is the fact that this guy was a sure-fire top-10 pick a few months ago and was still projected to go in the lottery by several sources come draft night. He also stated after the draft: ""I want to show everyone that I'm the best guard in this draft class... I'm going in there in high level shape and showcasing what I can do""
   * He showed a few flashes of greatness including a few games with 7 assists, a 31 point game in 29 minutes played and a few games with 3+ steals. He had another game against Cal where he had zero turnovers and seven assists, which if he can be more consistent with these type of games, he'll get some good minutes in the NBA.
   * There are flashes of his defensive and shooting potential. It seems to be more of a mental game with him, if he can get that down and commit in his off-ball play, he holds one of the highest ceilings in this class. The hope is that the mental game goes more in a way of Jimmy Butler instead of Andre Drummond. That's going to be up to him though.
   * In a nutshell, if he can lessen his turnovers and fouls, better his shooting and and be mentally present off-ball, the guy is going to be the steal of the draft and holds the potential to be a premiere guard in the league with possible all-star upside, unfortunately I have to emphasize the ""IF"" at the beginning of this bullet point. If he's unable to improve those areas he'll be out of the league pretty quick.",UtahJazz,21,https://www.reddit.com/r/UtahJazz/comments/1dpw2hv/what_were_getting_with_williams_and_collier/

2024-01-19,1705690342,Collin Sexton: Appreciation Post,"Collin Sexton is clearly our second best player, and a keeper for this team going forward.

The average TS% across the league is 58.1%, for SG specifically it is a little lower at 57.3%. This season Sexton has a 62% ts% with 27.3% usage. For context at how incredible this efficiency is, here are the guards with at least a 60% ts% and 25% usage: Booker, Curry, Doncic, SGA, Hali, Dame, Ryan Rollins (only 10 games played), Sexton, and Lonnie Walker (22 games played).

Sexton has been even better as a starter, with a 65% ts% on 28.8% usage. There are 7 players regardless of position that have at least 62% ts% and 27% usage. Those players are: Steph, giannis, KD, Embiid, SGA, Jokic, and Eugene Omoruyi.

Sexton has been incredible this season, and has great efficiency last season. He's only 25 years old, and we have him under contract through the 25-26 season at about $18M/year.

2024-01-30,1706640422,Lauri Markkanen is making history [OC Analysis],"\[Note: this post was originally intended for a general NBA audience to spread some love for Markkanen, so please excuse the ""no duh"" stuff that's obvious to Jazz fans.\]

The Utah Jazzs Lauri Markkanen, the Finnisher himself, is turning in a historic scoring campaign this season.

Last year, Markkanen took a steel wrecking ball to preconceived notions of his ceiling, blowing the doors off his career averages to become an All-Star and win the Most Improved Player award. This year, hes posted remarkably similar numbers, averaging 24 points, nine rebounds, and two assists while shooting 49% from the field and 40% from distance on eight attempts. But the raw numbers here hide multitudes.

Per [Synergy](https://apps.synergysports.com/basketball/players/633a2bcecf31008b53dcc22e/playtypes?seasonId=651b131d1507a2202c01094c&amp;competitionId=560100ac8dc7a24394b955ee), the seven-foot sharpshooter is one of the most versatile scorers in the league  hes in at least the 62nd percentile in points per possession (*\*takes deep breath\**) on spot-ups, off screens, in transition, off cuts, as a roll man, on offensive rebounds, in the post, and in isolation. Imagine a giant crossbow [shooting elite percentages from nearly everywhere on the floor](https://cleaningtheglass.com/stats/player/4314#tab-shooting_accuracy) but which can also dunk defenders into an early grave, and youve got the right idea.

*\[As always, I've collected a bunch of clips and a few really cool charts I put together showing my data.* [*Click here to view those in-context*](https://www.basketballpoetry.com/p/lauri-markkanen-is-making-history)*; I think they add a lot to this post.\]*

The three-point shot is the key to making it all happen. Markkanen isnt just a stationary shooter. He can catch the ball on the move and get it up in a hurry, and closing defenders bother him as much as an ant annoys a giraffe: \[[video here](https://www.basketballpoetry.com/p/lauri-markkanen-is-making-history)\]

Just like last season, defenders cant fully commit to the three-pointer because Markkanen is always a threat to fake toward the three-point line before cutting back for the lob: \[[video here\]](https://www.basketballpoetry.com/p/lauri-markkanen-is-making-history)

(Hilariously, the Jazz occasionally run that same play for unassuming forward Simone Fontecchio, too. Markkanen isnt the only Jazz shooter with some bounce!)

At face value, relatively little has changed with Markkanens role or output this season. But something interesting is happening below the still surface waters. After last years breakout season, I expected him to start using the ball more. [75% of his buckets were assisted](https://www.nba.com/stats/player/1628374/shooting?Season=2022-23), a very, very high mark for an elite scorer. The natural next step seemed to be more self-creation as he explored the limits of his game.

I was wrong. This year, that number has [*increased*](https://www.nba.com/stats/player/1628374/shooting?Season=2023-24)[ to 84%](https://www.nba.com/stats/player/1628374/shooting?Season=2023-24). That just& doesnt happen with a teams leading bucket-getter.

As of this writing, Markkanen is the 25th-highest scorer in the league, per [Basketball-Reference](https://www.basketball-reference.com/leagues/NBA_2024_per_game.html). 84% is by *far* the highest percentage of assisted buckets of any players around him; no one else even comes close. Look at this wild chart \[[link here](https://www.basketballpoetry.com/p/lauri-markkanen-is-making-history)\]

Generally speaking, the highest-scoring players are the leagues alphas, who tend to create a little more of their shots. As we go down the row toward more secondary options (typically forwards or bigs), assisted percentage slightly increases on average. But nobody approaches Markkanens reliance upon teammates.

(Side note: check out Doncic, who rides solo for over 80% of his buckets. Even for a ball-dominant point guard, that number stands out. Crazy.)

The difference between Markkanen and his high-scoring peers is even more apparent when we break it down by assisted twos and assisted threes: \[[nifty chart here](https://www.basketballpoetry.com/p/lauri-markkanen-is-making-history)\]

In fact, Markkanens dependence upon assists is unique in NBA history at least as far back as 1997 (when Basketball-References shooting data stops).

There has never been a player who averaged more than 20 points per game and created a lower percentage of his field goals. Only four players have ever scored 20 with an assisted percentage of 80% or higher: Markkanen now, Kristaps Porzingis in 2020, Klay Thompson five times, and Karl Malone twice. \[[chart here](https://www.basketballpoetry.com/p/lauri-markkanen-is-making-history)\]

(Stylistically, Lauri Markkanen is far more Klay Thompson than Kristaps Porzingis, and his game looks nothing like Karl Malone's pick-and-roll-heavy diet. It's interesting to me that disparate players all fall into this same group.)

Two offsetting factors are worth noting. First, most of his unassisted twos are putbacks and layups in transition. While that counts by technicality, its not what people really mean when they discuss self-creation.

Second, Markkanen shoots more than five free throws per game, a decent number (although not an elite one). But most of his free throws still come off cuts and rolls to the basket (which would have been assisted if he made the shot), not off him attacking off the bounce. In aggregate, Id argue that these paltry self-creation numbers might *overstate* how many biscuits Markkanen is baking for himself.

Its hard to know what to make of this. On the one hand, [shots coming off passes are generally more likely to go in](https://theconversation.com/data-reveals-the-value-of-an-assist-in-basketball-113893). The Jazz understand this  theyre tied for [fourth in the league in potential assists](https://www.nba.com/stats/teams/passing?Season=2023-24&amp;dir=D&amp;sort=POTENTIAL_AST) per game. Much of the teams offense involves getting Markkanen the Wilson in his comfort zones (which increasingly comprise the entirety of the court), and his activity off the ball has the gravitational pull of a black hole, opening things up for teammates. Ballhandling and passing arent Markkanens strengths. Hes a smooth athlete for his Brobdingnagian size, and hes quicker or stronger than nearly everyone who guards him, but he rarely creates advantages for himself or others with the rock. It makes sense to optimize him to the fullest as an off-ball threat.

On the other hand, it does leave Markkanen vulnerable to being frozen out for periods as the Jazzs unusual hodgepodge of guards and wings take their turn trying to get some. Jazz coach Will Hardy deserves all the credit in the world for getting his players to tap into their playmaking side  this year, veterans like Collin Sexton, Jordan Clarkson, Kelly Olynyk, Markkanen himself, and even Talen Horton-Tucker are all averaging career-highs in assists per possession. But Olynyk might be the only player on the team who is an above-average passer for his position, and he and Dunn are by far the most willing. The data says that [Markkanen is a beast in fourth quarters](https://www.nba.com/stats/player/1628374/traditional?Period=4&amp;PerMode=Per36), but fans have grumbled during some losses when Markkanen goes for a few minutes at a time without touching the ball late in games.

The inability or unwillingness to let Markkanen create his own shot could matter this postseason. The best defenses can throw a stick into the Jazzs bike tires and grind their scoring to a halt  Utah has been a [mediocre offense against the leagues top-10 defenses](https://cleaningtheglass.com/stats/league/fourfactors?season=2023&amp;seasontype=regseason&amp;start=09/30/2023&amp;end=10/15/2024&amp;opp_def_rank=top) all year, and that hasnt changed even with the new lineup the Jazz unveiled in late December. Its hard to see how someone so dependent upon teammates can be a top-tier force in the playoff crucible, when scouting reports improve, defenses are locked in, and even simple passes get harder.

But then again, if Utah makes the playoffs (far from a certainty, given the likely competition for the play-in spots), theyll be a heavy underdog in the first round anyway. The Jazz arent expecting a deep playoff run this season. They are flush with other teams picks and, with luck, will have ample opportunities to add a more traditional alpha via draft or trade. Like Thompson, Markkanen seems best suited to being the second option, commanding defensive attention with his off-ball activity while simultaneously enjoying more breathing room next to a ballhandling star. Its why hes a big name coming up for this seasons trade deadline, when several teams may make a run at him, but also why hes a perfect player for a reloading Utah team to hold onto. His reliable shooting and low-maintenance playstyle are a safety net for younger players, and at just 26 years old, Markkanen should be a strong contributor for years to come. Right now, he may be a Robin wearing Batmans cape, but thats not a bad thing! Letting him stretch himself as the lead Jazzman should pay dividends down the road when his role changes.

All that said, Id love to see Markkanen initiate more. Hes not even particularly aggressive attacking closeouts, preferring to shoot over them with his high vantage point or pass it back out to reset the offense. Theres some pulpy juice to squeeze here. Even if he takes a slight hit to his sparkling efficiency numbers, I want to see more efforts at off-the-dribble creation, particularly given Utahs lack of other elite scorers.

Excited about who he is as a person and not concerned at all""

Which leads me to believe two things could be going on 

1.) Everything that is being said is an exaggeration the Jazz looked into the allegations found them to be overblown and decided to move forward with him  
  
2.) All the allegations are true and the Jazz looked into them and said ""Well what are we supposed to do about that"" it's a personal relationship outside the scope of our control, and nothing is technically illegal.""

The Mormon part of it is also interesting to me. Disclaimer I am active in the Mormon church but also try to be as critical as I can be with my biases, but in the end all my friends that are mormon would find it super weird to see a 26 year old dating an 18 year old whether Male or Female, in fact the single youth ward in my area highly discourages and watches out for older men specifically trying to date anybody that is significantly younger than them. Also I haven't done deep research but how active in the church is she? Doesn't sound like she served a mission (she was busy too grooming a minor to do that)  Does she have the LDS church linked in her instagram bio? I don't know the Mormon thing being thrown out as soon as he is drafted by Utah seems weird.

Anyways I think this whole situation is bonkers, and it sucks that the Jazz now have another mark against them as the ""weird"" team in the NBA

2024-06-27,1719476697,CU Fans Perspective on Cody Williams ,"Hes the highest basketball recruit in our schools history. Honestly no idea how we pulled him in - was before Prime came in. 

Hes a freak of nature. 67 no shoes - probably still growing. Reach is 71ish but looks like 8ft. Doesnt have crazy hops but still gets up for rebounds with his length. 

He may be the most raw player I have ever seen. He will look like the best player to ever play college ball in Boulder and then swiftly look like a 7th grader mid growth spurt run a 4.4 down the court and lose the ball going up for a layup. 

His shot making ability is minimal. Hit the occasional mid range. Opposing teams left him open from 3. 

Shows elite slashing ability. Hes so fast and long hes like an elongated AI when hes feeling it. 

So skinny he gets absolutely bodied as a 3 if hit with a defender. 

Wouldnt say hes a great ball handler but his IQ makes up for that on offense. 

Potential to be one of the best defensive wings in the league - in the right place more often than not. 

Overall, Id he bulks up and develops a shot, in one- two years he will be a problem. He is so raw it was almost like watching a sophomore high school 5 star. He showed superstar flashes but needs to DEVELOP. 

I think yall got a stud.

2024-04-24,1713971636,"""Keep Lauri long-term but still tank until you get a star better than him"" isn't a viable path.","Saw this option talked about by a lot of Jazz media recently and it's a just horrible plan.



1. Lauri is good enough that with decent enough teammates (and hopefully some of Hendricks, George, or Kessler will be decent next year), it will be hard to tank that hard unless the Jazz have Lauri fake injuries. It will be hard to get below 25 wins and you kind of need to be lower than 25 wins to get top 4 odds.

2. Even if you get top 4 odds, the odds of getting a top 2 pick are between 26% and 27.4%... This is not very good.

3. Next year's draft looks average to below average outside of the top 1-3. Cooper Flagg, Ace Bailey, and Dylan Harper all have star potential, but massive question marks. I would expect only 1-2 of those guys to end up being good prospects so it will probably be a 1-2 player draft with a very meh at best 3-10 range.

4. Even if you get a star prospect, like half of star prospects fail.

5. Even if a star prospect develops, they often develop into a guy who is ""just"" a top 25 player in the NBA like Lauri is. If the Jazz got the #1 pick and got Ace Bailey and he turns into Paul George, that's great... And I don't know if prime Paul George is a guy who can win titles as a #1 (though  it would still be a very nice team to be clear).

6. Even if your star prospects develops, it often takes years and years for them to become a star, especially when you're taking a one-and-done Freshman in the top 3 (which is most common)

7. Lauri probably has 5-7 years left of being a star unless he has major injuries (which is very possible).

8. Tanking seasons, getting enough lottery luck to get a top 2 pick in a draft with star prospects in the top 2, actually hitting on that prospect, and that prospect developing into a star would likely take many many many years.

  
My expectation for the Jazz's future is this

  
1. Try to trade for big names and fail

2. Re-negotiate and extend Lauri.

3. Try again to see how good this core is

4. Unless Sexton, Hendricks, Kessler, or George have a massive breakthrough, the team will not be good enough to be top 6.

5. Detonate team again at trade deadline to tank again by trading Sexton

6. Try once again to get big names in the 2025 offseason

7. Fail and then trade Lauri for picks to start the true rebuilding process",UtahJazz,55,https://www.reddit.com/r/UtahJazz/comments/1cc0ql8/keep_lauri_longterm_but_still_tank_until_you_get/

2024-04-27,1714246416,"Cleveland is the team that got hosed by Ainge, not Minn","Of the two blockbuster trades a couple summers ago, Gobert to Minn for 5 players, 4 picks and a pick swap and Donovan to Cleveland for three players 3 picks and two pick swaps, Cleveland is the team that got hosed.

I dont think that this is a hot take, but it would have been last year. I love DM, but he is flawed and those flaws are only accentuated in this post season. He should be a walking basket, but in both Orlando home games they have had minutes without a basket. I think that Bogey and Ingles were both so good at punishing double teams that it kept them honest which made Donovan look better.

On the other hand it looked like we had won the Gobert trade because Kessler was an absolute stud his rookie year and Gobert struggled. A sobering year later the wolves looked like a top 5 team most of the season and our coaching staff has more faith in a mediocre Collins, it doesnt like such a bad trade for Minnesota. The way Gobert plays it raises the Wolves floor and that was the reason they brought him in.

I think that we won both trades, but I think that Minnesota is getting more or less what they paid for: an open championship window. On the other hand, even if Cleveland wins this series (which I both hope and expect them to) they will almost certainly be an easy out and head into an offseason where they must trade DM because they arent even close to Boston.

Does anyone see this differently? Whos excited to see what we do with all of our draft capital?

The pick will not be lower than around 28th - what are the chances that player will be better than Ochai who was the 14th pick two years ago? 

I get that Ochai did not show much (if any) improvement offensively, so even though I like him (seems like a great dude), I'm not saying losing Ochai necessarily makes a huge difference in terms of team success. 

But the return for KO and Ochai is... likely a worse player than Ochai? What's the point? What am I missing?",UtahJazz,92,https://www.reddit.com/r/UtahJazz/comments/1am613m/the_2024_1st_rd_pick_is_likely_worse_than_ochai/

2024-03-20,1710909651,Lauri Markkanen did not sound too happy about the Jazz in a finnish podcast,"Lauri was a guest on a Kristian Paloties' Kaunis Peli podcast that released this morning. Here he said that ""I am disapointed that the team got weaker on the trade deadline again"" and that ""I do not want to just play regular season games in the future"". On the future, he said that he would prefer to stay in Utah, but winning beign more important than the location was heavily implied.

More light converastions included talk about how he is one of the older members of team, and so he finds many of the jokes among the team abit juvinile. Also talked how it has been great to get to help the younger guys adapting to nba. 

Rest of the episode was focused on international basketball but I do not think that there were any relevant stuff to this sub. 

I personally hold the opinion that Lauri might be trying to pressure the FO to step up the timetable on the rebuild, and these kind of statements could be a tool to do that. He is not old, but I am not sure if it is wise to him or Jazz if the rebuild still takes years, and Lauri spends rest of his prime here.

In 1977, the then New Orleans Jazz drafted college legend and future hall-of-famer Lusia Harris in the 7th round (136th pick overall). Lusia was not interested and declined to try out and it was later revealed that she was pregnant at the time and therefore physically unable to attend training camp. She did go on to play professionally for a short time in the now-defunct Womens Professional Basketball League.

Lusia passed away just a couple of years ago in January 2022.

2024-07-04,1720096812,"""Keep Markkanen and  Sexton and Kessler but still tank"" feels like a horrible plan for player development.","One idea I hear from Jazz fans and media is that while Markkanen and Sexton are so good offensively, the team is so fundamentally broken (lacking any rim protection, perimeter defense, a SF in general, and a true PG) that the team will be bad enough to tank, especially if Will Hardy encourages Markkanen to not play hard and tries to lose with his rotations (eg, playing Sexton few minutes)

But let's say that like... Walker Kessler and Taylor Hendricks get moderately better. Not star level at all, but viable starter level.

Now the roster is much less broken and is just a 36 win team stuck around the 12th pick (which would be conveyed to OKC).

For most tanking teams, they're just so talented deprived that they can hope their guys get better and encourage their guys to play very hard.

For the Jazz, Walker Kessler and Taylor Hendricks getting to starter level while Markkanen plays hard would be a catastrophe as the Jazz would then have no path to getting a #1 guy. The Jazz would lose their 2025 draft pick and have nothing but mediocre draft picks incoming for the foreseeable future.

2024-02-13,1707838244,"Guys, the sky isn't falling","The way that the tide has shifted so quickly against Danny Ainge and the rest of the F.O for the Jazz is insane. That tweet by Andy Larsen brought a lot of hell-fire and doomsday-ers to the sub. Let's bring it back down to Earth and evaluate where we are as a team, and our future.

&amp;#x200B;

Firstly, let's address this past trade deadline. I know a lot of fans weren't happy with the moves, but let's break them down.

Simone Fontecchio for (essentially) an early 2nd round pick (probably falling in pick 31-33 range). Simone is a RFA this offseason, is 28 years old, and was a project when we brought him over from Italy. He struggled his rookie year as a 27 year old rookie, but had a better Sophomore season. The entire reason we brought him over was to develop him, and promptly trade him away (barring he turned into a 28-8-5 machine). He was a very low-risk project, and we flipped him for damn-near a late FRP.

&amp;#x200B;

Kelly Olynyk + Ochai Agbaji for Kira Lewis, Otto Porter, + a FRP. This was a fantastic deal. Olynyk is a UFA this offseason, but will also be 33 when the season ends. Not in our long-term plan, and again was brought in to recoup value and be traded. Agbaji is owed money until 2026, when he is an RFA. Agbaji was not a good basketball player. The best thing about him was he was a younger player, but he is going to be 24 when the season ends. Agbaji may have originally been in our long-term plans, but he played himself out of it. Both Kira Lewis &amp; Otto Porter are UFA's.

&amp;#x200B;

We were the only team in the league to get a FRP without taking on salary at the trade deadline. As a result, we have 11 players under contract for next year and around $39 milli in cap space.

&amp;#x200B;

So let's address the direction of the team. We have a grand total of 15 FRP from now until 2029. I highly doubt that we personally draft even 40% of those. The plan has always been (post Don &amp; Rudy) to accumulate as many assets as you can, wait for a superstar to want out, trade for them using assets, and then compete for a title. All while drafting in the mean-time.

Our current roster is not good enough to win a playoff series. Even before the trade deadline, we would've maybe got a play-in spot. Sure, playoff basketball is exciting, but my entire jazz-fandom we've made the WCF once back with D-Will over 15 years ago. The entire plan has always been to compete for a title, and these trades help us get there faster.

&amp;#x200B;

Most rebuilds don't take 5-10 seasons. Most rebuilds also don't take just 2 seasons. Remember, Danny Ainge has had just 1 full offseason post Don &amp; Rudy. He has had 1 draft post Don &amp; Rudy. We haven't even used a draft pick from Minnesota or Cleveland yet, and fans are already calling for his head. Realistically, who was available at this past trade deadline that would've moved the needle? Are we expected to use 4 FRP, Clarkson + Kelly to land Lavine? 4FRP, Sexton + Ochai + Simone for Dejounte Murray? Those trades would've left us crippled in mediocrity, as those two players aren't enough to move the needle. Sure, we'd probably be a top 5 seed, but we also would be bounced in the second round year after year.

&amp;#x200B;

Will Hardy has said in his post game interviews that we aren't as good as we were when we went on a tear, but we aren't as bad as we started the season. Taper your expectations to fit this team.

&amp;#x200B;

One last point, let's evaluate our current roster and think about who would be a contributing piece on a Utah Jazz finals team. Lauri, Sexton, Kessler, maybe Keyonte, maybe Clarkson. That's it. Even before the trade deadline, that is what my answer was. Remember the plan is wait for a top 10 player to become available via trade, and trade half of our picks we've accumulated for said player. Meanwhile, we need to fill out the rest via drafting, trades, and free agency. We hit big on Lauri, have promise in Keyonte &amp; Kessler, and solid outputs from Sexton &amp; Clarkson, but we need a definite team around the star when we make the trade.

&amp;#x200B;

All-in-all, have patience. The promise was never that the rebuild would be 2 seasons and we'd have a Championship within 4 seasons. We can't jump the gun and be fine with mediocrity. The end goal isn't to make the playoffs year after year as a 3-7 seed, the end goal is to win a championship. Danny knows what he's doing, and has done nothing to warrant this insane criticism.
