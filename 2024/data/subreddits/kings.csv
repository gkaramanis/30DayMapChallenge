Keegan owned the Warriors tonight!

Sabonis got his revenge!

2024-06-27,1719461645,Hear Me Out - Kings Just Stole a Top 4 Player in This Draft with a Late Lottery Pick. ,"I don't care, I'm so stoked right now.   Imo, the Kings just drafted one of the best players in this draft.   He is better than Castle, Holland, Topic, and everyone who was picked after the top 3.    Now, I like the aforementioned players, I just like Carter more.    What makes him so good?  For starters he has a 42"" vert.  He plays D like a MFer and he can shoot from the outside, often from NBA range and beyond.  Some people may say he's undersized, bruh, his wingspan is longer than Devin Booker, Bradley Beal, Keon Ellis, and the same as Klay Thompson and Ant.   Entice yet?   I haven't even gotten to the good stuff yet - Carter outrebounds bigs, generates a ton of steals, and to top it off he also averaged one block per game.   When your guard can give you rebounds, steals, blocks, and threes; you're going to out-rebound your opponent, generate more turnovers, and that'll lead to a lot of Ws.   I'm not finished yet, Carter can also handle the ball and he can find teammates.   The only thing question is whether his shot translates to the NBA.  If he can shoot, it's game over.       And if it turns out he can play PG (not that it's a must for him), you have a star.   

To recap, the Kings just drafted an athletic freak guard who can shoot, lock down players, outrebound bigs, disrupt passing lanes, block shots, and function as a secondary playmaker.  How many of those guys do you find in the NBA?   

Carter is light years better than any of the boring future backup journeyman forwards/wings who were still available.   Tristan Da Silva?  He's ok, but Carter is a better rebounder, defender, and shotblocker than Da Silva.    In other words, Carter the guard gives you more big man results than the big man Da Silva.  Da'Ron Holmes?  He's solid but Carter is just as good a rebounder and he shot threes on higher volume.   Tyler Smith and Kyle Fillipowski?  Pleaseeee.  They're not even 1st round talent.   Carter is better than all of them, maybe even all of them combined.   

This kid is going to be special.   I don't know if he'll be a star but he'll at the very least be a very important high level role player.   The Kings got a steal.

2023-11-19,1700367360,Kings Basketball Has Ruined Me For Watching Other Teams,"No Kings tonight, so I turn on the Bucks/Mavs game. Im watching and Im like, wtf is this? Wheres the ball movement? Are they ever going to even run a play? Every single possession is just Giannis dribbles down the court, takes it iso into a triple-team, shoots anyway or passes for a catch-and-shoot. Other side, Luke and Kyrie take turns calling for a screen, dribbling to the basket, and putting up a wild shot. Each side literally has one play that they run the entire game.

These are supposedly two of the elite title-contending teams. And the thing is, it works for them. Giannis runs into a triple team on every play and beats it most times. Why wouldnt they do what works? Luka and Kyrie take turns running the same pick and roll every time, and it works until it doesnt (and then they blow the game, a tale as old as time). But its just so *boring.* The Bucks made their run at the end and the crowd is into it and Im so bored that I turn it off. I was even rooting for the Bucks!

Am I ruined for basketball now? Do I *need* 6-8 passes, off-ball screens, and intricate plays to be entertained? Whatve these Kings done to me?!?

2024-01-24,1706132437,Fox and the pressure from media,"I believe there's unfair pressure placed by the media on De'Aaron Fox. Look at the circled part of the image. What do you see? That's right. FOX. 40. NEWS. The implications being that unless FOX scores 40 then it is not NEWS worthy. And he sees this night in and night out, shoved on his face by ravenous media members. That kind of pressure is never healthy. Imagine if your work pressures you to upsell the new Frosty flavor to every single customer, when all they wanted is just some baconator.

So let's petition to change the name for Fox 40 News to something more reasonable. Suggestions welcome. Maybe somewhere along his career averages is more reasonable. Fox 28.5 News or something like that.",kings,54,https://www.reddit.com/r/kings/comments/19es51o/fox_and_the_pressure_from_media/

Later, as the night's dragged on and the coterie of gorgeous narcissists grows  increasingly loose, he finds me on the balcony, my bowtie undone, smoking a cigarette. ""Got a spare?"" he asks.

""What's in it for me?"" I say as I hand him one of my little white ladies. He smiles.

""Conversation with me, duh.""

I laugh. ""What's so funny?"" He protests.

""Nothing, nothing... It's just... don't you grow tired of the fame?""

""You get used to it,"" he says, lighting his cigarette and handing me back the lighter.

2024-03-28,1711642813,The Future,"I'm not going to lie, losing to the Mavs the way that we did hurt a lot. I thought this team was ready to take a step forward. But I understand, 5 games in 7 nights is tough. 

But, I did have to remind myself, this is only year 2 of Mike Brown. The culture takes time to change. Mike Brown, is still improving as a coach. He's been on a roll with his challenges lately. He used to call T.O. 90 seconds into the game or quarter, now we're complaining that he's letting the guys try to figure it out on their own. Most of the time the players are failing. But one thing we can't deny, the culture is better. Fox, Ellis, Murray, Sabonis, and even Mitchell all have improved since last year. (some more than others), if we had this kings team playing the Warriors last season, we win in 5-6 games nand we're in the 2nd round. 

I think it's clear to say that Fox, Ellis, Murray, Sabonis is 4 of the starting 5 for the next 3 seasons. It's a hell of a floor. I'm excited to see these guys next season. I think Ellis and Murray are going to explode next season. Teams often take a step back after they have sudden success like we did last year. The fact that we haven't flamed out and guys have gotten better is a good sign. Improvement isn't linear. 

We just have to remind ourselves that it takes time to recover from being such a bad franchise, draft picks refused to share medical information or refused to come to pre-draft workouts because they didn't want to be a part of this organization. We crucified Monte for trading Hali, we crucified Monte for not trade HB to the Celts a few seasons ago. Remember how many people wanted Ham to be our next head coach? We killed Monte for trading Oliver-Maxence Prosper on draft night. But he had Ellis in his back pocket. 

Fan is short for fanatic. It's not always supposed to make logical sense. Monte and Mike Brown have done a great job turning this flaming pile of shit, into something we can get excited about. And in this league, all it takes is 1 guy, that ends up being HIM, that takes us to the next level.

2024-04-14,1713103344,One reason I liked this season regardless of how it goes down in the coming days.,"Keon Ellis. He single-handedly made this season worth it for me. We found/developed a good defensive player who imo is worthy of starting next season, on a friendly contract no less. He throws Monte a lifeline in allowing us to hunt more at upgrading PF/filler roles instead of needing to worry about directly upgrading Huerter. 

pre ASB, I feel that a lot of fans wanted players like Tybulle on the squad. Dont get me wrong, hes a good player, but trading for a piece like that seems moot to me now. 

We talk a lot about standing pat having hurt us this season, and in some regards I agree, but this is one of the upsides to standing pat - if wed traded for Caruso (better player but $$) or Tybulle, Ellis would either be on the bench or gone in a trade. 

 If i take anything away from this season, its that Monte probably has a better idea of who needs to stay and who needs to go, and a significant part of me is happy we waited it out a season, cause it allowed us to find another great player who was just a year ago playing mostly g league minutes.

2024-10-25,1729875484,Anyone else excited to watch this new offense?,"A few things that encourage me is that DeMar has changed our *entire* offense. We are no longing forcing DHOs every single offensive possession, fox doesnt have to force shots anymore, and Keegan looks to play better in this system.

We had four starters score 15+ and Malik with 17 off the bench. I was a bit confused on Mikes decision to play McDermott in the fourth quarter for 6 minutes as that just seemed extremely forced and a bad time for him to learn how to play/mesh with our players. Just felt like pointing that out. 

Obviously this is game 1 so it could be an overreaction but man I loved what i saw. How is everyone else feeling?",kings,58,https://www.reddit.com/r/kings/comments/1gbz2te/anyone_else_excited_to_watch_this_new_offense/

2024-06-26,1719436077,Can you downers shut up until after the draft please?,"In the immediate aftermath of the Knicks spending an obscene amount of picks on an at-best excellent 2nd option (probably), in the afterglow of the Kings winning 46 games and missing the playoffs by one game (both traditionally and in the play-in), theres been an onslaught of negative Nancy bullshit on this subreddit. Three hours from the draft, and the posts from today are about the following: tanking, trading Fox, screwing up the theoretical Siakam trade, and a lack of assets. Cant we talk about desired picks, final mock drafts, and draft/ trade rumors/hopes instead? Nothings fucking happened yet with this team today, and posters are spending the day planning a funeral.

We have no fucking clue who the Kings will end up with today, but no matter what happens, we have no clue what will happen with the Kings in the future. Could the get better next year? Yes! Could they get worse? Yes! Could a draft pick or trade from today work out well? Yes! Could it not? Certainly! Could some other factor on the team make a big difference for good or bad? Absolutely! We dont know!

So in the absence of any certainty today, I plan to enjoy the build up to the draft, after which I will rejoice or kvetch as called for. I really hope some of you do the same, because I love coming here and sharing my Kings love with other Kings fans.

Just&can some of yall be less Debbie Downer, at least until after the Kings make their pick, make a trade, or both?

2024-04-28,1714337620,Coming into this season I hated Brunson being lumped in with Fox in debates. Now its clear as day how much better he really is. ,Which means Fox needs to be able to tap into another level next season if we really want to be competitive and in the playoffs. What Brunson is doing and has been doing this season is what I expect from Fox. I know hes capable of it but he cant have another season where he continually looks disinterested in participating. His shot IQ needs to dramatically improve. I know the offense revolves around Sabonis but I feel we are so much better when Fox is involved as a facilitator too and not just a size up jump shooter waiting for an inch of space to shoot a 3. He can definitely average 28-5-7 in this league because we go as far as he goes. ,kings,103,https://www.reddit.com/r/kings/comments/1cfguh3/coming_into_this_season_i_hated_brunson_being/

2024-08-02,1722614390,Kings offered 4 firsts outright for Markkanen,"According to Matt George during the Deuce and Mo round table pod yesterday, he said he heard the Kings offered 4 firsts outright (not including pick swaps) for Lauri Markkanen. 

Source: [https://youtu.be/Q5Xzx5aEghM?si=D\_zd5BXeUsNmcWAS&amp;t=660](https://youtu.be/Q5Xzx5aEghM?si=D_zd5BXeUsNmcWAS&amp;t=660)

To recap the Lauri Markkanen situation, D-Lo said Danny Ainge never responded to the Kings offer of what appears to be at least 4 firsts outright plus match salary. Yahoo's Jake Fischer mentioned on multiple podcasts that the Kings were ""very close"" which makes me wonder if he has Jazz sources since he is a national reporter. Locked On Jazz host David Locke said he heard from non-Jazz sources that their front office had ""big cajones"" to turn down some of the Markkanen deals they have turned down.

I think the Kings revisit this next summer after Lauri signs an extension this offseason. (Most likely on August 7th so he won't trade eligible during the February 6 trade deadline.)",kings,114,https://www.reddit.com/r/kings/comments/1eidqnm/kings_offered_4_firsts_outright_for_markkanen/

2023-12-28,1703725180,How the Kings Looked at This Time Last Year,"I'm seeing a lot of comments about how this year's Kings are worse than last year, so I thought I'd take a look at where we were at this exact same time last year.

On 12/27 last year, the Kings were fresh off a blowout loss to the Washington Wizards (who were a terrible team), and then lost to in another blowout to the Nuggets. The Kings at that point were 17-15, good for a .531 win percentage and 7th place in the West.

Currently, the Kings are 17-12, good for a .586 and 6th place in the West. Strictly by wins and losses, there's no way to spin those numbers as this year's start being worse than last year's start.

Going back to the post game thread on this day last year, it's a little shocking. Most people thought that Malik Monk should not be getting playing time and was not a good contributor to the team. Many were also saying that the team had little to no chance of making the playoffs yet again, saying ""Looks like we're in for another long season"" or ""We're about to be 12th in the west reaaaal quick."" Several were lamenting that we traded away Fox instead of Haliburton, saying he will ""likely never going to get better than he his now.""

""As a pg he sucks at running an offense. He's strictly a sg to me but not an elite one like Booker or Mitchell.""

""It's so damn clear he's overpaid... we made an error in that.""

""He's an undersized shooting guard that shoots poorly from outside 15 feet.""

Just remember when you read all the doomer comments after every loss, these people have been doing this after every loss since the beginning. They will always react like this, it is who they are. Right now Fox is playing at an MVP level and the Kings are even more improved from last year's amazing team, and just about to hit an easier schedule, though there will be rough patches. When the Kings win, be thankful for what we have now. And when the Kings lose, just turn the doomers off. They'll never look back at their own outrageous claims and admit that they overreacted.",kings,52,https://www.reddit.com/r/kings/comments/18sgpno/how_the_kings_looked_at_this_time_last_year/

Only Kevin Durant and Karl-Anthony Towns have a higher 3-point percentage, but KAT only gets 8.5 rebounds and 2.9 assists per game (Domas = 13.2 rebounds and 8.4 assists) and Durant averages half the rebounds that Domas gets. Fine: Sabonis doesn't shoot a lot of threes, but haters need to watch games and look at stats -- he's having a historic run this season, all while being most likely to look like a mugging victim at the end of a game.",kings,34,https://www.reddit.com/r/kings/comments/1b3fvro/domantas_sabonis_appreciation_post/

Point B: Please for the love of Christ stop blaming mike brown who has taken us to consecutive winning seasons. What do you want?  Is to fire him like we did Mike Malone. Hes doing a good job, hes a good coach lets have him stay here for years. 

Point C:  if youre really bashing this kings team you cant possibly be a long term or true fan. Quite clearly a casual. If you cant be happy the kings are playing meaningful basketball in April, you clearly never experienced cheering on the likes of prime John Salmons.

2024-02-14,1707954084,Our boy De'Aaron Fox is gonna pop off and carry the Kings AGAIN tonight.,"**After correctly predicting the game DeAaron would pop off just last night (too bad his role players didn't show up to help get the dub), hes gonna pop off and carry this team AGAIN.**

Hes gonna go off for 30+ AT LEAST tonight and a dub against DEN. You heard it here first.

I'm confident because his most recent 40 and 30 point games are away when he doesn't have to hear his own 'fans' booing him live.

Haters gonna hate, but true Kings fans are here to stay for our drafted boi who is the only player on this team to carry us through his first 7 years of crappy management with 0 cmplaints.

**This is the turning point to the return of the DeAaron Fox we know and love. 40 + 30+ B2B games.**

This time tho, we getting the dub.

Notes from day 2 of Sacramento Kings training camp:

1. We didn't get to see any team drills today, but a lot of guys stayed after for individual work (including De'Aaron Fox)

2. A lot of people are encouraging Keegan Murray to talk more. Keegan said he feels comfortable demanding the ball when he's hot.

3. Terry Taylor was working on a lot of 3-point shooting off the dribble and was shooting really well.

4. Cal Bears men's basketball coach Mark Madsen was a guest at camp.

5. Mike Brown says the physicality has been really good and practice got a bit chippy today. The next step is playing physical without fouling, which was an issue last season.

6. More signs point to Keon Ellis starting at the 2 spot. Mike Brown pointed out that Keon commands the least amount of shots out of himself, Huerter &amp; Monk, which might be important with the amount of scorers in the starting lineup.

7. Malik Monk apparently is stealing the practice plans and keeping the coaches on schedule. Mike Brown says Monk calls out the drills before he does.",kings,30,https://www.reddit.com/r/kings/comments/1furygs/matt_george_notes_from_day_2_of_sacramento_kings/

EDIT: To everyone saying what about innocent until proven guilty??? let me make something clear. I am not a member of a jury. You are not a member of a jury. Innocent until proven guilty is a legal precedent, not a moral one. If your sister or daughter was in high school and told you that an older man had tried to get into a relationship with her, what would you say? Let me hear his side of it, I dont believe you, hes innocent until proven guilty. You could be like the Duke lacrosse team or the SDSU punter. I dont think Giddey should be thrown in jail and locked up without an investigation or trial. Thats where innocent until proven guilty exists: the judicial system. But its his word against the victims right now, and Im choosing to trust the victim.

But, with recent injuries and struggles it seems pretty clear that Keon Ellis will start. And Kevin Huerter most likely wants back a bigger role, so he would likely request a trade, right? The answer, NO. He loves it here. He has a nickname red velvet and is always super happy, but Id assume he wants another season like the 2022-23 season. The only way he will get a chance to have that back is, you guessed it, murdering Keon Ellis.

I understand this is relatively commonplace in the NBA now, however Draymond takes it to the extreme just like with everything he does. 

YES. Curry gets grabbed and fouled by people trying to keep up with him that doesnt get called.

Yet you have fans already booing the f out of the players who gave us so much joy just last seasn. Even the horrendous teams that couldn't make playoffs prior, with subpar players who dont give effort, dont get such loud boos.

You also got fans complaining about EOTY Monte McNair not making moves, when its obvious we have to be very careful and sure now that we're on the fringe of being a contender, having a hist of crappy management making terrible panic moves or wasted assets. All that while Monte has proven hes the best in the business and knows his sht well (thats how we got here in the first place).

Add on to that, the criticizing of our franchise star who got drafted to us through all the bad, gave us so many great individual moments of happiness in those tough 7 seasns, just cause hes on and off for 1 month. Dude is probably the only star ever who doesnt say a word about not making playoffs in 7 seasns, playing in Sacramento and is perfectly okay with re-signing in Sacramento, yet fans cant give him a lee way for being off form 1 month out 7 seasns? while being the face of this Kings revolutionary beam team who is the only King to show up toe to toe against Curry when it mattered most with an injured finger?

2024-01-18,1705556146,"Let's get inside Monte's head to examine some ""Realistically Likely"""" trade targets this deadline:","I like to think about and analyze this kind of stuff just because I think it's fun, and the team's bipolar performance and constant trade buzz has certainly made a trade *of some sort* seem quite likely in the near future. But the obvious question is, who?

To answer this question there are, at a high level, three main points to consider:

1. **What are the Kings' primary needs?**
2. **What types of teams might be looking to sell at the deadline, and/or what types of players might be generally available?**
3. And importantly, **What type of move(s) is Monte actually likely to make?**

Below, we'll examine these individually, then look at how they can all come together to inform what players might be in Monte's sights this year. Buckle up, this one is gonna be long. *(But I mean, realistically, like a 10ish minute read tops. This is reddit, not the NYT.)*

## Groundwork

### The Kings' Needs

This is something that the fanbase and media have discussed at pretty great length. I'm not going to pretend I'm a professional basketball analyst here, but I'll give my summarized take. Based on what I've seen on the court this season, and importantly read or watched from various analysts that actually know the team (e.g. not national media hacks like Bill Simmons), here are some of the Kings' biggest needs, in no particular order:

##### 3&amp;D type players that are actually good at both 3s and D.

Huerter, Barnes, Keon, Davion, Duarte, Sasha, and Lyles all effectively have the role of ""3&amp;D wing"" on this team, but virtually none of them are actually good at both. Lyles is probably the only one that could be considered good ""enough"" at both, and he's not exactly elite at either. (Although, sometimes he does go unconscious from 3.) Throw in the fact that both starters in this category, Huerter and Barnes, have been extremely inconsistent at their primary strength which is offense, and you get a big jumble of players that just cannot meaningfully impact the game on both sides of the floor.

##### A starting PF with real size and/or physicality that can play solid defense, especially help side interior, and fight for boards.

*(Likely a guy that overlaps with the above category.)*

We've seen time and time again how teams with a bit more size, length, and/or physicality can crush this team in the paint defensively, and teams that are elite at paint penetration absolutely eviscerate this team offensively. The biggest culprit here is that, 98% of the time, Domas (or backup center) is the only player that is consistently able to do any of: play with physicality; contest shots in the paint; grab a contested rebound. Aside from Len/McGee, Keegan and Lyles are the next best players on the team in these categories, especially on the defensive end, but one of those guys is a 2nd-year perimeter/wing player and the other is a ~20mpg tops bench player. Barnes, the *current starting PF* on this team, simply cannot affect shots in the paint and does not make any impact on the glass on either end.

##### Bench depth at the ""wing"" positions (2-4).

Lyles and Monk are the literal only consistent bench players, and they also have super off nights here and there. Anytime either one of them is off (or unavailable), the bench can only be expected to score about 20 points or so and just won't make any impact on the game. There have been many games this season where 3+ starters and/or Monk have had to score 20-30+ just to keep a game close. In general, Keon, Davion, Duarte, Sasha, Edwards, and others have all been straight-up negatives in the majority of, if not all, games they have appeared in.

Monk has the backup PG job absolutely locked down, at least for this season, so the Kings don't really need another bench ball handler. And for the most part, Len and McGee have provided a serviceable backup C ""by committee"" performance. An upgrade there is definitely possible, but not a priority imo.

##### Bonus: What *don't* they need?

Contrary to what seems to be a popular opinion on this subreddit and among the fanbase, as well as non-Kings media pundits, I *don't* think the Kings need to sell the farm to pick up a ""third star."" At the very least, *definitely not this season*.

(And for clarity here, when I say they don't need a ""third star,"" I'm specifically talking about another big-ticket, high-usage, 1st/2nd option, on-ball type player. Guys like Siakam or possibly LaVine. There are certainly *some* players, like Markannen, Mikal Bridges, or the recently-moved OG Anunoby, for example, that some people would consider ""stars"" that would still very much be good options in a world where price was no issue. But those guys are elite off-ball and/or low-usage players that would be great 3rd/4th option kinda guys while also playing both sides of the ball. Basically super-elite role players.)

A couple reasons.

**For one, and this is the biggest thing,** the Kings might already have that guy on the roster. Keegan Murray has already shown that he is capable of playing at an elite level on both sides of the ball and impacting the game in a variety of ways on both ends, including as the #1 option on offense and when putting the ball in his hands to make a play. And it's not just a fluke; we've seen him do it more and more as the season has gone on. In all likelihood he will continue to get much better as the season progresses.

Here, let me show you a table that has all of the player-identifying data removed. *(Also the 2p/3p attempt numbers, because that's pretty telling.)* These stats are for, not in this order: Paul George, Kawhi Leonard, Jayson Tatum, and Keegan Murray's 2nd-year seasons (well, 2nd half-season for Keegan). These are 3 of the most elite two-way All-NBA-caliber wing players in the NBA currently, plus Keegan Murray. **Try to guess which row is Keegan's:**

*(And don't meta-game it by looking up Keegan's shooting splits for the season or some bs.)*

|MP|FG|FGA|FG%|2P%|3P%|eFG%|FT|FTA|FT%|ORB|DRB|TRB|AST|STL|BLK|TOV|PF|PTS|
|-:|-:|-:|-:|-:|-:|-:|-:|-:|-:|-:|-:|-:|-:|-:|-:|-:|-:|-:|
|32.7|6.0|13.0|.464|.554|.376|.559|1.3|1.7|.800|1.3|4.1|5.4|1.6|1.1|0.5|0.9|2.6|15.9|
|31.1|5.9|13.1|.450|.483|.373|.506|2.5|2.9|.855|0.9|5.2|6.0|2.1|1.1|0.7|1.5|2.1|15.7|
|29.7|4.3|9.7|.440|.472|.385|.510|2.2|2.8|.802|0.8|4.8|5.6|2.4|1.6|0.6|1.8|2.9|12.1|
|31.2|4.5|9.1|.494|.554|.374|.556|1.8|2.2|.825|1.1|4.9|6.0|1.6|1.7|0.6|1.1|1.7|11.9|

Pretty damn similar numbers, I would say. Oh, and here's one other neat tidbit: Paul George and Jayson Tatum were both all-stars in their 3rd- and 4th-year seasons, at least 4 of the next 5 years, and virtually every year of their careers since. Kawhi took until his 5th year to become an all-star and really come fully into form but has been arguably the best of the 3 since, injuries aside.

Have you locked in your guesses yet? Alright, here's the order - I welcome you to click one at a time trying to find which one you think is Keegan:

&gt;!Keegan Murray (32.7mp)!&lt;, &gt;!Jayson . Tatum (31.1mp)!&lt;, &gt;!Paul ... George (29.7mp)!&lt;, &gt;!Kawhi Leonard(31.2mp)!&lt;

**The second reason** I don't think the Kings need to rush out to pick up a star player is simple: situation, and age. The West is really strong right now, and for as much as people talk about ""parity,"" the NBA as a whole is probably about as top-heavy as it's been in many years. There's no one single dynasty or all-time team, so there's parity in that sense, but the discrepancy between the best and the worst currently is higher than I can remember in quite some time. *(We're looking at multiple teams on borderline-record loss pace.)* The Kings are quite far, overall roster-wise, from making a serious push at that top level. Now, I'm not saying you should only ever try to become a contender when the rest of the league is garbage or anything. Far from it. But taking a swing at a title when you're barely a playoff team is just not smart business, especially for a smaller market team like the Kings that can't just count on superstars walking in the door in FA. They need to spend more time building first.

And fortunately for them, they *have* that time. Fox and Domas are *just* hitting what is likely going to be ""close to"" their peak production *this* year. Both are likely to make further marginal improvements over the next couple years before plateauing for a few years then gradually declining starting around age 32-33, assuming they follow a fairly normal career arc for star-caliber players. As discussed immediately prior to this, Keegan Murray could very well be right on the cusp of legitimate top-tier stardom. Assuming they stay on the roster, other key players like Monk and Huerter are also young and still (theoretically...) improving. And not only that, look at some of the teams fighting for the playoffs in the West right now: Lakers are old as shit. Warriors are old and on the brink of collapse. Clippers are old as shit. Within 1-2 years, it's likely that all of those teams will be completely out of the picture. Those are the teams that need to be searching for any possible ""win right the fuck now"" move, because their windows are teetering on slamming shut. The Kings' window just cracked open.

### The Sellers and Sellees

So what teams and which players are likely to be involved in moves as this upcoming deadline approaches? Well, obviously, outside of a select 2-3 players per team, just about anyone *could* move at the deadline. But realistically, there are a few main categories that you ""typically"" see moves from at the trade deadline:

##### 1) The ""Fire Salers""

The ""obvious"" trade deadline sellers are the bad, rebuilding, or about-to-be-rebuilding teams. Teams that know they have no chance and will typically look to trade players that are ""valuable"" *currently*, but don't fit their long-term plans or timeline. These teams want to trade ""win-now"" assets for ""win-later"" ones, whether that be draft picks or other young players who have development potential.

Teams like the **Pistons**, **Wizards**, **Spurs**, **Blazers**, and **Hornets** are the most obvious teams in this category this season. The **Raptors** have clearly also put themselves in this category with the OG and Siakam trades, trying to do a ""soft rebuild"" and reconstruct a new, younger roster around Scottie Barnes. The **Bulls** might be an underrated team on the edge of this category, as they pretty clearly aren't contenders and can't really make the moves to become one, but they also have had a history of obstinately refusing to join this category. They seem to be considering moving LaVine, but not DeRozan - from their posturing, it seems *they* think they fall in the *next* category. A final team to watch out for here is the **Nets**, who originally thought they could build around Mikal Bridges, but that hasn't looked so promising this year. They don't have an obvious path to contention with their current roster and might test the waters on how many assets they could get back in a reboot, but the fact that they currently don't own almost any of their own picks makes this a bit less likely.

##### 2) The ""Pawn Stars""

Typically, the next common category of deadline sellers are teams that are doing a bit of both buying and selling. These are usually teams that are ""on the bubble"" of being contenders, that have some star players or at least excellent centerpieces, but they clearly aren't contenders as-is and don't have enough young pieces to try and reset for a ""rebuild"" aiming for a few years down the line. These teams will usually look to do one (or both) of two things: sell off as many ""win-later"" assets as they can to get some substantial ""win-now"" ones; and/or swap some players that don't fit their system for ones that fill a need.

Teams like the **Lakers**, **Warriors**, and **Suns** are prime examples of this type of team this year. The **Hawks** might be a sneaky team to keep an eye on in this category given they have some star players fully in their prime like Trae and DJM, but are still struggling to even play .500 basketball.

##### 3) The ""Always on Sale""

Finally, rather than a specific type of team, certain players or categories of players are basically always available. Sometimes it's literally a singular player that a team has openly made available regardless of their situation, or somehow just seem to *always* be available. Jae Crowder is a guy that's been in this situation seemingly a few times over the last few years, for example. But more realistically, this consists of players that have simply fallen out of their team's rotation for one reason or another. Sometimes solid role players can just not fit with a given team, get traded, and immediately find success or make meaningful contributions in their new situation. Sometimes players that haven't really found their footing yet in the NBA can surprisingly do so with the help of a different coaching staff. Etc.

### Monte's Philosophy

I think we've all come to expect the ""marginal"" moves from Monte. He's primarily been the guy toiling away on the fringes, looking for disenfranchised players, players that don't fit, players that are worth more than their current team seems to be getting from them. His philosophy has been roughly the NBA equivalent of Moneyball.

The one exception, of course, has been the Hali/Sabonis trade. Obviously, that's also been by far the most successful and impactful move he's made as GM of the Kings, but I don't think that's gone to his head. Ever since immediately after that trade, Monte has returned to his ways of making the ""value"" (aka ""safe"") moves over the ""splashy"" (aka ""risky"") ones.

Let's look at some of the players Monte has picked up via trade and how/where he got them from:

##### Trades

* Kevin Huerter.

  Probably the second-biggest trade Monte has made. But also a kinda weird one, if you ask me. He got Huerter from the Hawks for what pretty much boiled down to just a single protected 1RP that will in all likelihood convey this upcoming offseason and be in the 20s. *(Justin Holiday and Mo Harkless were also included, but were borderline out of the league even before the trade.)* In theory, the Hawks at the time were roughly a Category-2 team *(see above)*, but obviously didn't get any immediate value from the pick. Likely, they felt they had a logjam at that SG/wing shooter position and may have been hoping primarily to free up space and get a flippable asset to use on a bigger wing or forward. In any case, this was basically a Cat-2 trade for a role player. *(Starter, but definitely role player.)*

* Trey Lyles.

  At this point, Lyles may very well be the 3rd biggest, or at least 3rd most impactful, trade that Monte has made. He's firmly a part of the rotation and one of the more reliable players in his role that the Kings have. And of course, we all know how we got him: by trading the underperforming malcontent Marvin Bagley III to the rebuilding Pistons, who hoped that they could squeeze more out of him than the Kings did.  Of course, they probably got even less than the Kings did and gave up a reliable role player in exchange. Big L there. But in any case, this was clearly a Cat-1 trade, again for a role player.

* Sasha Vezenkov.

  While his start with the team has been rocky, it seems likely that he will have a long future in the NBA. He has shown that his elite shooting will probably carry right over once he is adjusted, and his instincts on defense and on the glass have been excellent. His defense is still held back a bit by his slow feet and lack of athleticism, which will likely keep him as a bench player throughout his career, but he could easily develop into an extremely solid offensive + rebounding bench forward. I didn't even remember exactly what the Kings traded or with whom to get Sasha, so allow me to refresh your memory: the Kings traded a pick that would end up being #49 overall with the Cavs *(they picked Isaiah Mobley, Evan's much-less-talented older brother)* for the rights to Vezenkov, $1.75m in cash, and a 2nd-round pick swap. Sasha's rights were essentially thrown in as an afterthought; the cash and pick swap alone were already worth about the value of that late 2nd-rounder. This all amounts to what is essentially a Cat-3 trade - albeit for a player the Cavs didn't even actually have at the time - for a role player.

* Kessler Edwards.

  Kessler might not have a role on this team anymore, primarily due to his almost complete lack of offense, but he is still on the roster and originally showed some amount of promise in limited minutes last season. He occasionally gets subbed in at end-of-quarter possessions for defensive purposes. But the main point is how he was acquired: the Kings traded the Nets the draft rights to David Michineau *(unlikely to ever see the NBA)* in order to pick up Edwards *and* get some cash back. At the time, the Nets were a Cat-2 type team, though of course they aren't any longer. But this wasn't a Cat-2 type trade, as Kessler basically never saw minutes for the Nets. They essentially dumped a player who was warming their bench to the Kings to free up cap and roster space, making this much more of a Cat-3 type trade. But if you want to nitpick, call it a Cat-2.5. Either way, once again for the rolliest of role players.

* Chris Duarte.

  Similar to Edwards, Duarte has found his role ever-diminishing due to lack of offensive output. He was meant to fill TD's role as a 2-way 2-guard off the bench that could fill in for a consistent 10-15 minutes and push that number to 20-30 when he gets hot. But... he never got hot. He never even played with consistency. Either way, the Kings got him from the Pacers for a couple far-off 2RPs in '28 and '30, the former of which wasn't even the Kings', it was the Mavs'. Given that Duarte had fallen out of the Pacers' rotation and plans, this boiled down to a pretty cheap Cat-3 trade for a role player.

* Delon Wright.

  Obviously long gone by now, but Delon played pretty well for the Kings in one of the final doomed seasons of the drought. The price? A washed Cory Joseph and another couple 2RPs, once again only one belonging to the Kings. *(The other was originally the Lakers'.)* Surprisingly, CoJo lasted quite a while on the Pistons - longer than Wright on the Kings, if memory serves, who himself was traded as part of a deal that brought in Tristan Thompson to the Kings, from the Celtics as part of a 3-team trade. The acquisition of Delon essentially boiled down to a Cat-1 trade for a role player, while his subsequent dealing away was moreso a Cat-2 trade for a role player.

##### Analysis

As we can see, Monte loves dealing with teams and picking up players from all three of the above categories. *(For what it's worth, the Hali/Sabonis trade would probably be considered a Cat-1 type trade. Pacers were clearly entering rebuild mode until Hali turned out to be their centerpiece/star of the future.)*

But Sabonis trade aside, there is one extremely strong common thread throughout all of the trades:

**Monte loves to buy low on role players.**

All of the players he brought in had either fallen out of the rotation on their teams, were being pushed out, or simply did not have a role or spot on the team at all. And in all of them - except for probably Tristan Thompson at the cost of Delon Wright, in hindsight - Monte traded an asset that was either virtually zero value to the Kings, or worth far less to the Kings than the player he got in return.

## Putting it Together

So, now that we got all of the homework out of the way and understand what types of players might be available and what type of players Monte likes to target, where do those models cross over with actual teams and players in the NBA right this minute? Well, this section might actually be a lot shorter than the prior, even though ostensibly this section is what the post is ""about."" The main reason being, I'm not a professional NBA scout. I don't have the time or knowledge to assess all 29 other teams in the NBA, plus some G-league players, and think about every possible player the Kings could target. That said, I do have a few thoughts:

### Some Likely Players

##### Rui Hachimura (PF, Lakers)

Rui is a guy I've kinda liked since before the Lakers ever picked him up. He's been mentioned occasionally by analysts, pundits, and fans that have discussed Kings roster moves over the last couple years. The reason is pretty simple - he's a young player that's shown to be capable of doing just about everything on the basketball court and has flashed some incredible potential at times, including in the playoffs. He has good size and athleticism, can shoot pretty well off ball, create his own shot, score at all three levels, plays solid defense, and rebounds pretty well. As a key rotation player and spot starter in the playoffs last season, he was a huge spark for the Lakers in several games and lit it up from 3 while making consistent hustle plays. He's kinda like a better, younger version of Trey Lyles or a younger, slightly bigger and far more assertive version of Harrison Barnes currently. He could quite likely slot directly into the starting PF position and immediately improve the team's defense, rebounding, and flow on offense. And if not, he'd instantly be the second- or at worst third-best player off the bench.

As mentioned above, the Lakers are a Cat-2 type team this season. Something is just not quite right on that roster or with that team in general, and it likely starts with a logjam of players at the forward position with very few reliable playmakers at the guard and/or wing positions. Rui hasn't completely fallen out of their rotation or anything, but Darvin Ham seems to favor Taurean Prince, Cam Reddish, and often even Jarred Vanderbilt over Hachimura - not to mention, he shares the same position as LeBron. He could probably be picked up from the Lakers for a very reasonable cost, and this might even be a team where a player like Davion could be an asset rather than just salary filler. (Not a centerpiece, but a needle-mover to some degree as opposed to an afterthought.)

##### Aleksej Pokusevski (PF, OKC)

I had my eye on Poku at *last* year's deadline. I thought he could be an excellent complementary player to Domas in overlapping rotations and just a really solid bench piece in general. At one point last season he was leading the entire NBA in some key block stats (can't remember which, apologies) despite being a bench PF. His career shooting numbers are poor but he was approaching a 40% or at least high-30s% 3pt shooter last year before an injury to his shooting arm. He's also struggled with injury this year and has played only 7 games so far. Based on some feedback from Thunder fans, it seems like he's just never fully recovered from his injury yet. Don't get me wrong, Poku would be a very long shot and probably wouldn't contribute this year. But he's only 22 still, and buying now is about as low as you can buy on a player. A single 2RP or random benchwarmer would likely be enough to pick him up as a Cat-3 type player, if not even less than that, and he could have some very solid upside as a 3&amp;D 7-foot wing player if he recovers.

##### Matisse Thybulle (SG, Blazers)

Thybulle is a prototypical 3&amp;D player. On the Sixers, he was known as one of the best on-ball perimeter defenders in the entire NBA, but he simply couldn't seem to find any real shooting consistency, at an appalling ~32%-ish over his time in Philly on barely over 2 attempts. In Portland, however, he seems to have found new life as a shooter - shooting about 38% on 4 attempts per game from 3 during his Blazers tenure, while still playing extremely solid defense. Now obviously, as mentioned, the Blazers are likely to be a Cat-1 type team this year. So any player that isn't obviously in their ""core of the future"" - pretty much just Simons, Sharpe, Scoot, Ayton? - could be on the trade block. Matisse looks to be about the 7th-8th guy in their rotation but has started some games when filling in for injury - basically just barely above the role that *Duarte* has for the Kings. So likely, it wouldn't cost too much to pry him away from Portland. However, I think Thybulle is a much better player than Duarte. His defense is better, his shooting is better, and he's the same age. He could easily, once again, become the 2nd-3rd best player off the Kings' bench and/or slide into the starting lineup depending on other moves. Either way, he could fill a huge need for the Kings of 3&amp;D players that are actually good at both.

##### Alex Caruso (SG, Bulls)

Now, obviously, Caruso will be in demand for many, many teams around the league. Including the Bulls themselves! They seem to be deluded into thinking they're just a couple moves away from being contenders again, so they might not want to part with an extremely versatile glue guy like Caruso. But maybe as the deadline approaches, they might fall ass-backwards into some sense and start acting like a Cat-1 team, making basically anyone over the age of 25 available for trade. Caruso is almost 30, meaning he's in a decent age bracket for the Kings, but not a rebuilding team. If the Bulls *can* be convinced to move from Caruso, he'd be basically a better version of Thybulle - all-defensive caliber defender that can guard 1-4 (well, some 4s) while shooting ~40% from 3, making hustle plays, and crashing the boards. He's one of the best 3&amp;D guards in the NBA, and I imagine Monte has probably kept just about a constant open line of communication surrounding a player like him. The only things holding this back are the aforementioned high desirability across the league, and the Bulls FO being delusional. If he does get moved, and Kings win the sweepstakes, I'd imagine he'd take the starting 2 spot with Huerter sliding down to augment the bench depth or being traded as part of this or another deal.

##### Moses Moody (SG/SF, Warriors)

The Warriors are on the brink of blowing everything up to try and frantically rebuild one last contending roster around Steph. *(Personally, I think they should go in the other direction from a basketball perspective and trade Steph to bring in one of the biggest rebuild war-chests of all time. But that probably doesn't make as much money in the next quarterly report.)* Moody is a guy that could potentially have ended up on the block as a Cat-3 type player anyways, seeing as he's fallen out of the rotation a bit with some DNPs and being left to rot on the bench in key moments even when playing well. But now, the Warriors will be looking to trade probably every young/""win-later"" asset they have to reconstruct a ""win-now-hopefully"" roster around Steph. Moody isn't an elite player by any means, but he's a young player that's showed a fair amount of promise as a versatile two-way player with decent shooting, rebounding, and defense. Ironically enough, HB might be just the type of player the Warriors are looking to acquire, and the Kings might even be able to get more than just Moody out of them in general.

##### Kyle Kuzma (PF, Wizards)

Kings were rumored to be linked to Kuzma in the offseason. At first, when he signed the deal he did and the Kings got HB for the deal *he* signed, most people probably breathed sighs of relief. Kuzma is earning $8.5m more this season at $25.5m total, and Barnes had been solid for the last several years straight! Kuzma wouldn't have been much of an upgrade and might have played too selfish a style of basketball for the Kings system. But then the season came, and Barnes went. His production has dropped off a cliff so completely that even his first couple years in the league look pretty good from where he is now. And meanwhile, the Wizards are a clear Cat-1 type team, Kuzma is continuing to play pretty solid basketball, and his contract doesn't look nearly so bad - especially since it's descending, while the cap is increasing year over year. He's earning less than 20% of the cap this year and will decrease to barely 11% by the last year of his contract. He's got some really solid size and length and is a competent player on both ends of the ball. Sure, he's playing pretty ""fuck it, chuck it"" basketball over in DC right now. But have you seen that team? It's a disaster. He's effectively the 1st option on that roster, where he'd be probably the 4th or at best a co-3rd in Sac. He's been a role player before, in LA, and did well in that role. He might not *want* to go back to playing that kind of role, but that's something you should be able to get on the phone and find out before locking in a trade. If he's willing to take a clear backseat to Fox and Domas and potentially behind or trading off with Murray, he'd be a really solid pickup. If he's not willing? Oh well, good luck in DC.

##### Danilo Gallinari (SF/PF, Pistons)

Here's an oddball one. Hear me out. Gallo might be getting old (35), but he was basically just traded from one young, rebuilding trash heap (Wizards) to another. He's been a bit down the past ~1.5 seasons, but as recently as a couple years ago he was a really solid bench scorer, and just a year before that he was still among the upper echelons of bench scorers. He doesn't play ""big,"" but he is 6'10"" with some length to get in passing lanes and is still a great shooter. If the Kings like what they have in Vezenkov, then this probably doesn't make much sense, but Gallinari would play a very similar role with a lot more experience - and so far, MB doesn't seem to be the biggest fan of Sasha. Kings could also bring in Gallinari on a 1-2 year basis for Sasha to play behind and learn from, as a successful 13-year vet in a similar vein of player. The main thing here is that the Pistons would likely give him away basically for free, so he might be worth a flyer - which is right in Monte's wheelhouse. That said, I put him last on the list because I think he's probably one of the last guys the Kings would target among all of these players, so I doubt we'll see his name in purple anytime soon unless they strikeout bigtime on other guys.

##### (edit) Some Extras

Adding some names that I saw in the comments section once or twice that fall into this category, imo. Ctrl+F the comments and you can probably find the thread(s) discussing them pretty easily.

Dorian Finney-Smith (SF/PF, Nets), Jock Landale (C, Rockets)

### Some Unlikely Players

I wanted to talk about just a couple or so other guys here. These are players that I think would probably be pretty good fits for the Kings due to their skill sets, could probably be available for trade, and would fit the Kings' timeline, but for one reason or another, I don't see them being realistic targets. Nothing against these players, and some I might even be happy or elated to have - but this is *likely* not the season we'll see any of these guys. *(Inb4 the Kings announce a trade for one of these guys less than a week after posting this.)*

##### Jerami Grant (SF/PF, Blazers)

Back to the Blazers again. I have mixed feelings on Grant. For one, he's a very talented player, still under 30 so he's got plenty of good years left, is a talented defender and shooting over 40% from 3 on solid volume, and absolutely shits on the Kings every time we play him. But on the other hand, he's a high usage player that's even smaller than Murray or Barnes, meaning he may take critical touches away from Keegan as he hopefully progresses towards being an all-star, while simultaneously doing nothing to fix the Kings' glaring issues with size. But the biggest reasons I don't see the Kings making a move on Grant are: a) he's the Blazers best tradeable asset as a Cat-1 team, meaning he will have a potentially very high price in picks or other young talent, especially considering his current contract lasts through 26-27 with a player option for 27-28; and b) his aforementioned contract is currently ~$28m and increases by ~$2m per year over the whole contract. Grant would be a very expensive player both to acquire and to keep, and while he'd likely be *good* on the Kings, I have serious doubts that he'd be much better than Keegan even by just next year, in an extremely similar role, that costs over 2x as much. (Assuming a world in which Grant *doesn't* come to the Kings and cannibalize Murray's touches.)

##### Zach LaVine (SG, Bulls)

Aaand back to the Bulls again. Unlike Grant, I do think LaVine would be a pretty much outright great fit on the Kings. While he is definitely capable of and has shown a desire to play as a pretty ball-dominant self-creating player, he has also proven to be an elite off-ball offensive threat. He may not be an elite defender, but he has very solid athleticism and decent length and would be a clear upgrade on that end - and really, both ends - over Huerter, the guy he'd directly replace. And he's only a year older than Domas, so plenty of solid career left (barring injury issues). But yet again, LaVine is likely the Bull's best trade piece if they truly want to be a Cat-2 team. *(DeRozan would likely demand more assets if they truly wanted to blow it up as a Cat-1, but again... don't seem to want to.)* He can fit on literally any roster as a 2nd, 3rd, or 4th option type player and is versatile on both ends of the floor. Monte likely won't feel good about paying the kind of price he will likely demand, especially considering... **That absolute albatross of a contract.** He is currently earning **$40m**, about 30% of the salary cap, and that number will increase by ~$3m per year through 25-26 (with a player option for 26-27) to maintain that 30% figure. He would be *by far* the highest-paid player on the roster by about $10m/year over Fox despite becoming the team's 3rd option. And if we again expect Keegan to develop, something that LaVine likely wouldn't interfere with unlike Grant, Zach could easily be making $46m/year as the team's *4th* option by the last year of that contract (not counting the option year - $49m for that one). Unless the Bulls bite an enormous bullet and do some kind of cap-sharing or contract buyout magic that would allow the Kings to pick him up with only a ~$20-30m *max* cap hit over each year of his contract, his contract would enormously financially cripple the Kings without realistically making them a true Finals contender. I just don't see Monte in on that.

##### (edit) Some Extras

Adding some names that I saw in the comments section once or twice that fall into this category, imo. Ctrl+F the comments and you can probably find the thread(s) discussing them pretty easily.

Dillon Brooks (SG, Rockets), Deni Avdija (SF, Wizards), Mikal Bridges (SF, Nets), Grayson Allen (SG, Suns)

## Limiting Factors and Conclusion

Lastly, I just wanted to highlight a couple potential limitations to *any* trades the Kings might make.

Mainly, the big big limiting factor is the dearth of ""real"" assets the team has. ""Huerter, Barnes, Davion"" has been memed to death, but of those three players, only Huerter is likely to have *any* noteworthy value to most teams. A desperate Cat-2 team, like the Warriors, might want Barnes, but they wouldn't want him so bad as to give up really good assets on his account. Davion, let's be real, is probably worth about as much as a 2RP to most teams - maybe slightly more, simply because they'd be getting a 2nd-round talent immediately instead of in 1-5 years. And beyond those three? Forget it, Lyles and Vezenkov would be the only other players worth anything, and probably both only slightly higher value than Davion. Anyone else would probably be worth *less* than a 2RP. So that leaves picks. But the thing is, the Kings don't really *have* picks. They have no extras, and one of their own (likely this year's) is already accounted for thanks to the Huerter trade. So realistically the Kings have about 3 1RPs to work with, none of which will be very high value thanks to probably landing in the 20s range.

But another important thing to keep in mind is the ""small market factor."" Players on expiring deals should always be considered a flight risk, and players with overpriced contracts are an enormous burden due to the Kings basically *never* being willing to pay the luxury tax. Especially with the new, harsher tax rules coming next season (I think, maybe the one after), large contracts like Grant or especially LaVine will be extremely heavy burdens to the Kings, especially when Domas, Fox, and Murray will all be coming up for new contracts before their time with the team is done. The simple fact is that the Kings are *not* the Lakers, Clippers, Warriors, Heat, etc. that both have the desirability, revenue, and ownership buy-in to spend big bucks on big names. They never have been and never will be.

***

Anyways, I think that's enough from me. If you read through the whole thing, I appreciate you and hope you found it interesting. Obviously, things will start to heat up more and more over the next few weeks. I mentioned it at the start, but I do think the Kings will make *some* kind of move, and I hope I'm at least somewhat close to the pulse of the team with some of these predictions. If you agree or disagree with any of the post, would love to hear your thoughts in the comments.",kings,70,https://www.reddit.com/r/kings/comments/199ir01/lets_get_inside_montes_head_to_examine_some/

2024-03-14,1710455327,This morning I decided to clickbait the entire Lakers fan base& and it worked,"Let me start with a preface& Fuck. The. Lakers. With that being said here is the story time:

I was listening to the Lakers post game press conference this morning and noticed a clip of their head coach talking about their defensive effort. I purposely clipped a video and left out key context to which it sounds like Darvin Ham is saying: **I wish I could tell Mike Brown please just let us know what youre going to run on offense so we can stop it.** Now that isnt the full quote of what he said at all but i just made it seem like it. 

The ONLY reason I clipped it and left out context is because i know the Lakers have the most insufferable, toxic, and entitled fan base in the world (fuck the lakers) and that they would take it and run with it. The actual quote from Darvin Ham was [(video of full quote):](https://streamable.com/3rn6rz) I wish I could tell Mike Brown please just let us know on offense what youre going to run so we can stop it& **but thats not the case so you gotta be ready for a little bit of everything&**


All I did was [post it to the NBA sub-reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/s/UpUbwFrBJI) and it worked exactly as planned. The Lakers fans start mention how dumb he was and blah blah.  edit: they removed my post on the NBA Reddit 

From there [they posted it to their sub reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/lakers/s/tO6zZKJL3y) and it really gained traction. 

After that [another huge NBA twitter account (that also sucks off the lakers)](https://x.com/thedunkcentral/status/1768382251761283331?s=46&amp;t=9UCeLFqajM0Z1KsUSg41mg) posted it. edit: this is at 6k likes


Once that gained traction [Their biggest twitter account @LakeShowYo tweeted it out of context too.](https://x.com/lakeshowyo/status/1768383447775822196?s=46&amp;t=9UCeLFqajM0Z1KsUSg41mg) (currently at 3k likes lmao)

From there, LegionHoops (another big twitter account that sucks the lakers off) tweeted a link from [LakersDaily.com where someone wrote an entire article on it.](https://lakersdaily.com/darvin-hams-latest-comments-will-do-nothing-but-piss-lakers-fans-off/) 

Was this fucked up?? Eh, Maybe. Was it worth it to sit back and watch Lakers fans become even more mad after a 4-0 season sweep? Absolutely. Fuck The Lakers and Go Kings.

..as a fanbase. we get Demar, we resign monk which felt impossible, monte is still making moves. And the entire subreddit is bitching about 5 pre season games. 

Dumping on our franchise player and our young Keegan is pitiful. You guys have my permission to doom mid season if were still bad, other than that suck it up and act like youve been to basketball hell before. 

I swear since the 23 season game threads have been awful and you guys cant be satisfied.
