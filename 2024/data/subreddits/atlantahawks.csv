It really feels like the team is building some direction with promising young players like Daniels, Bufkin, Risacher, and Johnson. We are trying to address the defensive weaknesses that have plagued us since the beginning of the Trae era. Trae will be returning to the heliocentric style of play after the problematic Dejounte trade, a role that clearly suits him much better. We're building versatile defensive lineups that can play off Trae well. As I said, we probably won't be contending for a championship next season, but we are clearly moving in a positive direction after years of stagnation.

2024-01-21,1705858249,Trade Idea (I should be the Hawks GM and Owner),"Hey guys. We all know our front office and ownership are completely incompetent. As a sweaty armchair basketball savant (currently living in my parents house to avoid the IRS and because I have no in-person social skills), Im feeling the urge to tell you all about my plans before the trade deadline via ESPNs Trade Machine. 

1. Saddiq Bey is a scoring MACHINE. He had a 51 point game at one time in his career, and is a lethal 3&amp;D player in the league. Selling high on him to the reigning champs should allow us to get some young pieces to set us up for the future. I believe Jokic is a great backup option for Okongwu (DID YOU SEE HE CAN SHOOT 3s NOW??? HES BASICALLY GIANNIS AND BAM IN ONE PLAYER BUT BETTER). Jamal reunites with his brother, Dejounte, and should be a good young scoring player off the bench behind Trae. I dont know who Michael Porter Jr is.

2. Patty Mills has been a phenomenal veteran for us, but its time to send him back to San Antonio. SA is in need of a quality point guard to feed their rising star big man, Zach Collins. We can take on the salary of rookie big man, Victor Wetbanana. Stringy and lengthy, he has talent to develop as a quality backup for Jalen Johnson (JJ >p== AWOOOGA).

3. With the acquisition of Jokic, Clint would unfortunately fall to 3rd string center for us. While it hurts to let him go, we get some good value back from Minnesota for Atlanta-native and gay-hater, Anthony Edwards. Naz Reid was added to the trade because I like his name.

4. DeAndre Hunter is expected to return in 3-4 years.

All in all, our lineup looks like this:

Starters:
PG: Trae Young
SG: Kobe Bufkin
SF: Anthony Edwards
PF: Jalen Johnson (====)
C: Onyeka Okongwu

Bench:
PG: Dejounte Murray, Jamal Murray
SG: Bogi, Naz Reid (I have no idea what position he plays)
SF: MPJ, Garrison Matthews
PF: Wellbeyondya, Mo Gueye,
C: Bruno, Jokic

2024-02-02,1706915454,My thoughts as a 31 year Hawks fan.,"Im 31 years old Ive rooted for the Hawks my entire life and Ive reached the point where sadly I just dont care anymore. 

When I was young we were terrible so I get it not a lot of media attention. When I was teenager we had the highlight factory and we were young and fun to watch Joe made the ASG every year got his obligatory 8 mins of play and sometimes got one or 2 shots up. But even when the highlight factory hit its peak we were still laughed off as an after thought most of our playoff games were on NBA TV which meant I couldnt watch them due to my cable package. 

Then came the Budenholzer years. We kept our upward trend and became a #1 seed and were still laughed off and seen as an after thought. As the 1 seed we were still put on NBA TV. I went to Game 2 of the Cavs Hawks series that year. Even though it was a 5 hour drive for me. It was embarrassing. The stadium was packed with Cavs fans. 

Over the years Ive been to about 50 or so Hawks games despite never living in Georgia. Ive been to Game 1 of the Pacers vs Hawks 1/8 series, the ECF Game 2 vs the Cavs and the Game 4 v the Cavs in the 2nd Round. Half of the games Ive been too have been away games. Yet theres only one place that consistently is packed full of away fans. Atlanta. 

The NBA has turned their backs on us and not treated us as a real legitimate franchise because our own city doesnt. Now theres a lot of issues with the NBA I believe its essentially turned into WWE with basketballs. With propped up stars and preferential calls for popular teams and popular players. 

But we as a franchise dont take ourselves seriously so why should anyone else? Ive never seen or heard of players getting MVP chants in away arenas but ours and weve done it to like 4 or 5 players at this point. 

Honestly after years and years of this and now the Trae Young years where anyone with eyes can see how talented the guy is and he gets absolutely no credit. It just makes me essentially not interested in watching this crap anymore. It kills the love of the game.

&gt; The remaining trade deadline activity, to this point, is expected to focus on nearby cities Atlanta and Charlotte. The Hawks continue to be described by rival executives as the most active and aggressive team in the marketplace, motivated to discuss the majority of its veteran players, highlighted by All-Star guard Dejounte Murray  arguably the best player known to be available. Elsewhere on the roster, Atlanta has held its most notable discussions on Clint Capela, DeAndre Hunter and AJ Griffin, according to league sources, dating back to the offseason. Its become clear that Atlanta values Sixth Man of the Year candidate Bogdan Bogdanovic as highly as any player on its roster not named Trae Young and Jalen Johnson, according to league sources.

This was his down year. This was the worst start hes had to a season his rookie year and led to him shooting 43% from the field and 33% from 3 on the season. 

And thats actually much better than hes doing right now 7 games into the year. 

Bro is shooting 33% from the field, and 27% from 3. He hasnt scored 25 points in a game yet.

This is not just a bad shooting start or him starting every season slow 

In Traes rookie season he shot 42% from the field and 34% from 3 to start the season. So this is the worst start of his career by a good margin. 

Whats even crazier is that 2 season ago you could argue Trae was a top 5 most efficient guard in the league. 

From the 19-20 season to 21-22 he put up 
27.8 PPG on 45/36/88 splits. Thats efficient, high volume scoring. 

What the fuck happened to Trae Young?? 

From a play style perspective this is the best hes been playing off ball, getting easy looks, much improved defense and incredible passing but the scoring has dropped off a cliff. Literally the worst its been in his basketball career&.

2024-07-13,1720845058,Summer League Game #1 Takeaways,"-Risacher seems really good at creating space with a step back move on 3 point attempts, but based on this game alone, that shot needs to get a lot more consistent. Right now, he seems more natural when catching and shooting 3s right off the pass. The good news is that playing with Trae, hes going to get a lot of catch and shoot 3 attempts on some dime passes, which will really help his shot % from deep. He can also clearly pass really well, and the 2 assists on the box score dont do him justice in this game since he had several really nice passes that should have resulted in assists had the shooters made those shots. And I was pleasantly surprised with how well he could handle the ball on fast breaks. You can also see the defensive potential in this game. Even though he got blown by a handful of times with shorter guys driving to the basket around him, I thought he did a good job being in the right place to grab some rebounds, and even when he couldnt get the rebound, he would get a hand on the ball and tip it to someone nearby who would snag the board. Overall, very pleased with what I saw in his first game with the team and his 18 points, 2 assists, 5 rebounds, and 1 block, and hes obviously only going to get better from here. Rookie of the year potential for sure, and definitely feel good about the #1 overall pick right now.

-Nobody out-hustled Mo Gueye this game. He feels like a good candidate to play that Saddiq role for us this year with the way he was flying around the floor, diving for loose balls, and he got 3 steals and 13 foul shots for his efforts. He needs to stay in the NBA and out of the G League this season and get some 2nd team minutes. His 3 point shot wasnt falling today, but we need his energy and hustle coming off the bench this season, and he has a nice looking stroke that will get better with more reps.

-Djurisic gets the dunk of the game early in the 1st quarter, probably the most hype play of the game slamming it over Sarr + one other Wizard. Love his passing ability and handles for his size. With that said, his shot simply did not look good this game. 2/6 from the floor (with 1 of those being the dunk) and just 3/7 from the free throw line, and those 4 misses looked real bad. Korver and Bogi need to spend some time with this kid and let him develop in the G League, and I dont know how much well see him in the NBA this season, especially with Vit coming back to the team.

-Keaton Wallace quietly filled up the stat sheet off the bench as well, scoring 10 points with 4 rebounds, 6 assists (leading the team), 2 steals, and 1 block. And apparently he just earned himself a 2-way deal with the Hawks as a result. Congrats Keaton!",AtlantaHawks,34,https://www.reddit.com/r/AtlantaHawks/comments/1e21qz4/summer_league_game_1_takeaways/

*  Trae is being honored in Norman, Oklahoma today by having a street named after him.  Multiple guys from the team will be there.
* The Hawks are really good at offense and there are a lot of stats that prove it that haven't changed in two days lol
* This is a bit of a re hash but the Hawks don't have a single 5 man line up that plays 10 minutes per game.  Our two starting line ups (with Bey and Johnson interchangeable) play 9.5 and 9.7 minutes per game respectively.  The starting line up's net rating with Saddiq is 0.8.  The starting line ups net rating with Jalen is 1.7.

2024-06-29,1719684784,Man I hope we prove the casual NBA fan base wrong next season ,"Everywhere I look on social media there is this overwhelming consensus that the hawks have been robbed and what are they doing and that their entire FO should be fired for these moves.  Now everyone seems to think we are rebuilding and Trae is gonna be traded next when in reality we are reshuffling to get the RIGHT pieces around him instead of mixing and meshing players who may be better but dont fit. 

Firstly we draft Risascher and everyone is already calling him the worst No.1 pick in years without even seeing him play. 

Then the Murray trade everyone is going on about how we were fleeced and traded him for a packet of chips, when in reality that was probably the best package we could get. People think its 2K where you just trade a star for another star. Maybe we couldve got BI, but with him comes the money issue as well as him taking touches away from Jj and Zach as well as his playstyle not matching Quinns philosophy. I believe getting Ingram wouldve been a lateral move (unless he came with the package we got)

Now finally we let saddiq Bey go to free agency, which makes sense if we want to elevate Vits role as well as Risascher. Saddiq wasnt too great for us last season and wouldve most likely been redundant this season. Now all of a sudden again everyone on social media is rambling on how the hawks are taking so many Ls this offseason and that our future is fucked. 

This has pissed me off. I understand not many non-hawks fans would actively watch us, but this whole chatter that every move weve done is poverty and Trae is gonna leave is so stupid. I swear the casual nba followers have no understanding on how the trade and FO market works and that you cant just acquire superstar and after superstar and pay everyone. I guarantee you as the record predictions come along a lot of analysts will probably have us with a pretty low record but man I really hope we prove everyone wrong. 

Pairing Trae with length and versatility is the first step in the right direction and Im slowly starting to regain hope that we are moving in the right Direction again. But I guess nba social media does not agree.

So if you really think about it, if we never had Cam, we would have never had the 2023 pick from Charlotte, then never had Dejounte....which means we could have gotten a player that actually fit they system better, thus making the playoffs and never getting the 1st round pick

Onyeka Okongwu was picked at #6 and he is still working on basic center skills and becoming a full time player.

With Dyson OFF the court (37 minutes ) were a -9 , with a 11.5 offense rating (still pretty good) &amp; a TERRIBLE 126.3 defensive rating ( that would be 2nd to last )

His three points shot is ok, but he's still developing it. Really it's just a confidence thing, multiple times he passed up good looks to  swing the ball. Very unselfish.

Now we get blessed with the first overall pick and a chance to draft a 71 defensively gifted, although offensively challenged center in Sarr. This is Traes ideal partner! A savvy big man could seriously push Trae young into a new level. 

Now people want to trade him!?!? Are you kidding me? We finally have the chance and resources to create an ideal roster and people want to blow it up!? I seriously cannot believe that people want to give away our best chance to create a roster that can actually compete. 

IMO the best course of action is getting BI from the Pelicans for DJ, and filling the rest of the roster with decent wings and defensive guards from a possible Dre/CC/Bogi(?)/OO/AJ trade. 

also, fuck the lakers. They dont deserve Trae and I hate the media for trying to push him there.

One was just inactive for over 7 years so not much story there. The other one however was a bit of drama so for full transparency here's basically what happened: 

Over the past few months if not longer we had a lil' bit of a struggle where the now departed mod took away most of the mod permissions from the other mods(as such we were not able to ban anyone, or even really remove posts at the end there). They also did not communicate with the other mods and straight up ignored us when we tried to talk them. Anyhow, it all came to a big thing today when they de-modded us all and said he would step down and appoint a new mod. Reddit admins stepped in and removed him and now the Good Guys are back in charge folks. 

He did also remove all the CSS and its assets. Now I have an old backup (like 5 years old) so I'm gonna try to restore that but I do also have like a job and its damn near christmas so might be a while.

Theres a world where the Mavs play the Celtics in the finals where if have to do what? Root for Luka? Root for A and Tatum? Idk. The only decent scenario is if the Nugs/ Wolves win.

Now imagine all this and the Hawks have the 10th pick. Garland looks to be traded so thats less value for DJM. Wed actually be so screwed as franchise.

2024-05-23,1716483780,"[Brad Rowland] First bit of intel from a prominent national source on the Hawks and the No. 1 pick... Per Marc Stein, Atlanta is ""increasingly expected to be choosing between two Frenchmen  Alex Sarr and Zacchanie Risacher"" with the top pick.",,AtlantaHawks,74,https://www.reddit.com/r/AtlantaHawks/comments/1cyxv17/brad_rowland_first_bit_of_intel_from_a_prominent/
2024-05-17,1715973058,As long as he pans out defensively a realistic floor for Sarr is still a 1 of 1 player.,"Decided Id throw my hat into the ring and make the 17,000th Sarr post on the sub but Ill try to come at it from a bit of a different angle. Since this is going to be a longer post I figured Id give you guys the gist of it before I begin. This post is about what Sarrs prime could look like even if he doesnt capitalize on all of his offensive upside and become a real star player. And how even if that is the case as long as he develops how hes projected hell still be a player of tremendous value. 

This pick is way more valuable than people are letting on. Assuming he develops Sarrs floor is still sky high. Hed be a great player even if he doesnt hit on his star potential. Assuming his individual offense and shot creation never develop past where they are right now hed still be one of the most valuable role players in the league. Theres a reason that hes the closest thing to a consensus number 1 there is in this draft. Its because of all the 2024 prospects he has the highest chances of doing something elite at the next level. Baring major injury or some other unforeseen tragedy he should be a perennial DPOY candidate in a few years. If he can be that with a respectable C&amp;S three ball at worst hed easily be in that Derrick White tier as arguably the most valuable non star player in the league. 

How many 5s in league are over 7 tall, have no real injury history, are athletic, can stretch the floor, comfortably guard on the perimeter, are rim protectors, can attack closeouts by getting to the rim OR pulling up in the midrange, and go coast to coast pushing the break after grabbing a board? That is a very realistic floor for Sarr. With his physical profile and instinct the defense projects well, his jumper passes the eye test, and his shooting numbers across the board have gone up every season over the past 3 years (heard 3 from a scouting report but can personally only find stats for the past 2). Correct me if Im wrong but unless someone else comes along in the next couple of drafts hed be the only player in the league that checks all those boxes. Even if you lower the height requirement by a few inches there are only a handful of players in the league that do any combination of half of that. The only 2 that come really close to meeting all criteria are Wemby and Chet but both of them have had injury histories.

You cant tell me that 30 out of 30 teams in league wouldnt bend over backwards for a guy like that. Thats the type of guy that could potentially make all star teams just because hes a major contributor on one of the best teams in the league a la Draymond Green. A completely different archetype of player but someone thats capable of being the ultimate glue guy of any championship caliber team.

The best part is this is just looking at his realistic floor in a vacuum. This doesnt even take into account his synergy with Trae and Jalen. How many stretch 5s are in the league that cant be played off the court defensively? Without even mentioning all of the other things he can do, that alone will make Trae and Jalens lives so much easier. Imagine a version of Jalen Johnson flying down the lane and just being able go up because he doesnt have to worry about a big standing right outside the restricted zone. Imagine a version of Trae young that doesnt have to rely on all of those long floaters and can actually get all the way to the rim for much easier layups instead. Im sure this alone would do wonders for his efficiency.

This offensively conservative version of Sarr would eat off of them too. Playing beside a plus passer in Jalen (who still hasnt reached his ceiling in that regard) and arguably the best passer and P&amp;R ball handler in the league would generate so many easy looks for him. Whether those be open looks in the paint, in the midrange, on the perimeter, or even situations where he can put the ball on the floor and take advantage of late closeouts. 

As the primary screener for those 2 hed definitely put up an impressive ppg total. Maybe peaking somewhere around 3rd year John Collins. He probably wont be at Johns level as a long roller because John just has an exceptional feel for that. Its the one thing he does better than almost any other player in the league. But even in this conservative estimate of his offense Sarr already projects as a better popper and short roller due to the ability hes shown to put the ball on the floor and score himself or find the open man in those situations. That production on O while being one of best defenders in the league is someone that will make all star teams. Probably not a perineal all star because hed %100 be a system player but depending on how good the team is on any given year his numbers would definitely get him into at least a few.

In short Im not letting anybody gaslight me into thinking this pick is the equivalent of drafting Tobias Harris number 1. Not that Tobias hasnt had a good career. He peaked as a fringe all star player and if you were able to quantify overall basketball talent maybe Sarr peaks there too. The difference is what Sarr brings to the table would be MUCH more valuable because the tools he possesses are MUCH rarer and MUCH more integral to winning. Im not saying its a forgone conclusion that hes going to be the player I just described or better. But Im very confident that with no major setbacks he at least develops into something in the ballpark of this post in his prime. And make no mistake that is (currently) a 1 of 1 player. We just gotta pray the front office makes the obvious choice on draft night, our young guys develop, and we can fill in the blanks between Trae, Jalen, and Sarr in the next couple of years to push us into contention.

2024-02-20,1708460839,"JJ Redick gushed over Quin Snyder's ""5 Slot"" (an innovative tweak of traditional 5-Out offense). So I put his words over video examples of Atlanta's offense. Enjoy!","On his recent ""Old Man and the Three"" podcast with Tyrese Haliburton, JJ Redick spent \~ a minute talking about something I've been calling ""5 Slot.""

&amp;#x200B;

So I put his words over a [YouTube video](https://youtu.be/C-w0pn2u5KE?si=njAJn5MSc4_TdMId) that shows clips of the Hawks running 5 Slot (I also [tweeted it out](https://x.com/bowser2bowser/status/1759667408103440690?s=20), in case that's your social media of choice).   


Quick explanation:   
1. ""5 Slot"" is a subtle (but significant) tweak on 5-Out, but the center (aka the ""5"") moves from the top of the key to the weakside/far slot (near the wing)  


2. ""5 Slot"" is not a real term. I don't know what Snyder &amp; the Hawks call it, so I invented a placeholder to label my plays -- and since I still haven't found the correct term, I'm using ""5 Slot""  


3. Here's [an earlier video introducing 5 Slot](https://x.com/bowser2bowser/status/1722690190693527664?s=20) (the twitter thread link above and [copied here](https://x.com/bowser2bowser/status/1759667408103440690?s=20) has more tweets/explanations of the concept)   


I know coaching/Quin Snyder have been a divisive subject, but I'm a big believer in him, and stuff like 5 Slot are partially why I support him as HC.

Enjoy!

I am 95% sure the following teams will be better than the lakers.  

- Thunder

- Nuggets 

- Timberwolves
 
- Mavericks 

- Suns 

The 6th - 13th seed in the west is a complete toss up.  They will have to compete with&


- Pelicans (got better)

- Kings (got better)

- Rockets (got better and older)

- Grizzlies (got healthier) 

- Spurs (got better and healthier)

- Clippers (got worse)

- Warriors (stayed flat)   

There are 8 openly tanking teams in the league next year.  Everyone else is competing.  Even without any injuries Lakers will be in play from anywhere from 9-17.  If Bron or AD miss significant time that pick could easily be 6-9.",AtlantaHawks,80,https://www.reddit.com/r/AtlantaHawks/comments/1dyalk1/i_would_be_shocked_if_our_2025_lakers_pick_is_not/

2024-10-22,1729604142,Its time to give Landry his props,"The guy has, frankly, been knocking it out of the park since he officially became GM.  AJ being his obvious big misstep and the jury is currently still out on Kobe, but by all accounts he has done well with every other draft pick hes had in both rounds.  He was gifted the #1 overall pick but its hard to argue that there was any other player in the draft that fit better with our team while having all star upside than Zacch.  

- He navigated maybe the worst cap situation in the league from the get go.  It is wild that we had JC, Deandre, and Capela all on the team at the same time with their negative contracts. 

- The return for Dejounte was peak.  It wasnt going to get better than that and he pulled the trigger at the right time.  That New Orleans offer was better than anything we were receiving in season and he was right to wait. If Dyson can continue to play like this hell play 30 mins a game and will make the all nba defensive team, and that Laker pick could be a lottery selection. 

- Speaking of Dejounte, that trade doesnt happen unless he signs a very team friendly deal.  Landrys doing again. 

- Vits deal was fantastic.  With Kobe injured, Vit will have a chance to take over as our backup PG for pennys on the dollar. 

- And finally we get [this tidbit](https://x.com/BTRowland/status/1848528845474824467) from Brad Rowland: 


&gt;De'Andre Hunter will make 15.43% of the salary cap this season for the Hawks. Using current salary cap estimates, Jalen Johnson will make less than that percentage in both the 4th and 5th seasons of his contract extension.

This JJ contract is the chefs kiss.  This is the inverse of the way Travis signed players.  By the time JJ is in his 4th season we will have so much ridiculous flexibility, unless Zacch or some one else evolves into a max player we should easily have the cap space to bring in a max level player in free agency during this time period even if Trae signs another max, while still retaining depth.

2023-12-01,1701445020,Snyder coached teams have a history of starting slow especially with new players. Here are some quotes from Jazz fans for perspective.,"Let me preface this with some info I posted in another thread earlier this week.  Quin teams have a history of starting slow and catching fire later in the season.  A lot of people contribute this to the complexity of his playbook.  Some examples: 

2021/2022 - 4-4 start before finishing 49-33

2019/2020 - 12-10 start before finishing 44-28

2018/2019 - 9-12 start before finishing 50-32

2017/2018 - 19-28 start before finishing 48-34


I went over to r/jazz to dig up some old threads and see what Jazz fans thought about Quin.  I did this when we signed him as well but wanted to circle around now that weve seen the Quin product on the court.  Here are some interesting quotes that I think can be applied to the current state of the Hawks - 

&gt; Amazing playbook, but it will take your team time to learn it and some guys may never. Players' coach, gets close with his stars and vets but always with an eye toward competing, so it's not in a way that makes others feel shunned. Short leash for young guys but if one shows signs of being a real star he won't miss it.  Brings a very good developmental staff alongside him, most notable for finding new talents in old veterans. 

&gt; Top tier coach. Will put in a system, and that system may take some adjusting to, but once it's installed it's fantastic.

&gt; Good schemes and sets. Had the number 1 defense and offense here in different years. Seems to get guys to improve individually.

&gt; He expects his young players to know his system perfectly before he'll give them playing time, so he's usually got a short leash on them until they do. It also seems like a fairly unique system, conley had a rough time adjusting to it, but when it's clicking it's awesome

&gt; Every time we picked up a new guy it would take a year for them to fully integrate into the offense because the playbook is so insanely complex.



And a couple of quotes that show that Quin is already coaching a little differently than in Utah - 

&gt; don't expect him to use challenges 

&gt; He doesn't tinker with rotations. His starters are his starters and that seems to never change. 


So yeah basically the point that Im trying to convey is that sure, things dont look amazing right now.  We are seemingly starting the season the same way we have the last two years, with the same shitty defense and inability to put a win streak together and stay above .500

But we are also seeing similarities between this iteration of the Hawks and Quin teams that had a lot of success.  This month is going to be tough to watch.  But things will improve.

On January 22, 2018 during Donovan Mitchells rookie season(The first season Quin had a star guard) the Jazz lost 104-90 to the Hawks to drop to 19-28.  They won 11 straight after that and never looked back.  That, or something better, can be us.

2024-10-18,1729292517,This is this the most optimistic I have felt as a Hawks Fan.,"So first of all let me apologize, cause me liking something is usually a red flag.  I like cucumber lime gatorade and single moms from Hall County.....I have objectively terrible taste. 

But this is the first time I've LOVED a Hawks team in my 30 years living in Georgia. I enjoyed a bunch and I always loved the cheap tickets, I've had season tickets since 2014 and I take my kiddos to probably a 1/3 of the games. Holy fuck, they don't know how much better they had it. I had to be excited by JOSH FUCKING CHILDRESS. I had to watch years of Josh Smith committing crimes against God and Man. 

It wasn't all bad, Joe Johnson got paid a lot of money to wear baggy shorts and average 22/5/5 for a 5 Seed. Ivan Johnson was a fucking BLAST (THE MAN PLAYED WITH A GRILL IN).

The Bud Hawks were good but LeBron was just overwhelming, I think we all knew that we weren't gonna go through if LeBron was healthy. 


I never really have had hope for the future like I do now. We have two really dope things happening. 

1.) Trae Young has not yet peaked, but will soon be there. He's been the lead option for so long that we forgot how ahead of schedule he really is. That's changing, this is about the range where people put it together completely and Trae is a to the right of the bell curve kind of offensive player who's only going to get better. Also don't forget, we have an easy 2-1 3-1 trade that's been rumored for a little bit. MPJ+filler for Nance/Hunter ( and hopefully not Bogi) is legal to happen near the trade deadline and considering the fact that MPJ and Trae are best friends.........

2.) JJ is a revelation.  Holy fuck is he good. Yo! Like he's gonna be a top 50 guy and an all-star in the next 2-3 years. And I would bet he gets Most Improved Player this year. But it's not just JJ. It's Zach, we didn't fuck the pick up people, we actually got a damn good player.  

So this year we are gonna have Trae/JJ/Zach/Bogi/Capela/OO/Hunter/Dyson/Nance/Bufkin.  That's likely how the minutes will shake out.  That's a team with good shooting, switchability and rim protection. Everyone plays HARD and Zach is a better defensive rookie than I've seen in a while. Add into this that Trae is the second coming of Nate ""Tiny"" Archibald and is coming into the peak of his powers RIGHT NOW.  I really like us this year. And going forward, we have the bulk of our talent still yet to peak. 

My only worry is that DeAndre Hunter and his midrange curl screen jumper will become my 13th reason before he gets traded. Plz pray for me I don't like my odds.",AtlantaHawks,47,https://www.reddit.com/r/AtlantaHawks/comments/1g6v5z7/this_is_this_the_most_optimistic_i_have_felt_as_a/

The Spurs have so far approached building around Wembanyama as an intriguing experiment, where they will weigh all different kinds of variables around their Rookie of the Year.

I'd basically be completely tuned out from the team at the moment if he stopped releasing podcasts etc.  All of the national outlets and some locally have such sensationalist takes on the Hawks and are trying to cover us like we're a Bravo TV show.  It has really soured me on the NBA media.

It recently occurred to me that as a pretty obsessed Hawks fan Brad brings a lot of value to my fandom and he puts in a lot of hours to do it.  I know that SB nation recently axed a lot of podcasts and Brad's Braves podcast was one of them, so he lost an income stream.  With that in mind I just started a monthly subscription to his patreon account to show my appreciation.

I know we aren't supposed to advertise anything on here and I'm definitely not associated with Brad in any way.  I just know that Brad is pretty much the voice of the hardcore Hawks fan and many on this sub view him as their main source of Hawks news.

If youre on Twitter hes a great follow for data like this.

Very encouraging sign that Dyson has already surpassed All-Defensive team DJ in this metric at a younger age while still ascending. For reference DJs all defensive second team was in the 2017-2018 season as a 21 year old. He missed his age 22 season in 2018-2019 so Im assuming thats why it flattens out that season before the heavy decline started. With more minutes and opportunities for him next season Dyson has a real chance to break out on both sides of the ball. 


Snagging a potential defensive culture setter whos going to be 21 for the majority of next season on a rookie contract was so huge for us. Hell probably be pretty reliant on Trae on offense but thats fine. Thankfully he isnt a total zero on that end since he can cut, handle, pass and has a pretty good in between game with his floaters. Most importantly hes still young. Its not like hes a flawed player in or past his prime. Hes still very early in his development and should only be getting better with a real role and an organization thats going to invest in him. As long as the coaching staff can instill some confidence in him I have zero worries about him being hindrance to a Trae Young led offense. At worst I doubt hed drag us down as much as Murray (on both sides of the ball with Trae) and Capela (on offense in general) did last season.

LeBron barely passed him so if he plays just one game he could end up even higher while Dame would need to really turn up in order to overtake him. 

Trae who's 8th is closer to Harden who's 5th than to Dame who's 9th.

Last month Amazon pulled out of a deal to invest $115m in Bally and the status of the streaming talks became unclear.  Some quick hits - 

*  Amazon is going to release a brand new sports specific streaming app at the start of the NBA/NHL seasons that will cost around $20 a month
* They are in talks to broadcast all regular season Hawks games minus nationally televised games 
* The broadcast would still be a Bally product, but Amazon would handle the stream.  Presumably Bob and Nique and the normal Bally staff will still be featured
* This isn't an exclusive deal, so it's possible that Bally would still strike a deal to broadcast games with other streaming services as well like YoutubeTV

Reading between the lines, this reads that Atlanta will NOT take Sarr and the disagreement between Sarr and Atlanta is very real. Doing so, that takes away any leverage you had with the pick to begin with.

Even if Sarr wasnt the top pick on the board, it makes very little sense to me why the GM would come out and unleverage the pick like that.

I live in the Chicago area and I normally rock my favorite teams shirt while I'm playing basketball so I had a Hawks shirt on and I had a a father/son duo on my team. The son was probably 13 years old or so and he was calling me Jalen Johnson throughout the game. I got a good laugh out of it but was also quite surprised that some kid out here in the Chicago suburbs first thought of a Hawks player was Jalen Johnson.

2024-06-28,1719618347,"This trade is Good, and doomer takes are kinda missing the point.","Dejounte is the most ""talented"" player in this trade. And we traded him for less than aquired him for. 

Gotta get that out the way.

Dejounte was our owners attempt to come in and ""shake things up"". You see it everytime a new ownership group comes in, they overpay on some splashy sounding name, ignore fit and tank their franchise.  THIS trade isn't bad the trade for DJ was the issue.

Honestly our willingness to not keep sinking resources into making that bad choice feasible gives me significant hope for the future of our franchise. That's a FO that can make decisions that aren't based on job security or non bball reasons.


Now onto the trade, it makes no sense to have a team spend all of their salary cap on bigs and guards. It's just flawed team construction. Wings are the thing that are scarce in the NBA, and when I say wings I mean good wings.

Dyson Daniels gives us a 6'7"" defender who can guard the point of attack and is ONLY 21. He's younger than many of the players we watched get drafted in the first round.


On top of filling a hole in our current roster, with  someone who has upside beyond the issues he solves, we got two other first round picks and an expiring contract that will keep us flexible and out of the hard cap and apron situations that will hurt us.

2024-05-27,1716826131,Sick &amp; Tired of the Trae Young Hate,"I don't care what anyone says... he's the best guy in franchise history to put on an Atlanta Hawk uniform. The front office has let him down... he's never had a legit super star right next to him his whole career, and he still carried us to the ECF... and dropped 48 in game 1 in Milwaukee... that game 1 of the ECF he was only 22 when he did that, and now he's 25 (will be 26 this year).

I believe the best is yet to come for Trae, he's nowhere near his peak yet. He also carried us in the play in games in 2022 and 2023... and the only reason we didn't get to the playoffs this year is because of the injuries.

Minus the bubble year... this was the first time Trae Young was out of the playoffs since his rookie season.... and again... I blame the front office... the DJ move just wasn't the right fit. We would've been better off keeping Kevin Huerter and trading John Collins a year earlier.

But here's what really pisses me off. This is the year we finally get the #1 overall pick by a miracle... what's there at #1 addresses OUR NEED! What we've been lacking... size and length in the paint and at the rim. We have a chance to FINALLY have a big man superstar next to Trae... and now ppl want to get rid of Trae in the year we can get the #1 pick that would be the perfect fit for us... are these people out of their minds?

The radio pundits and the callers... (getting tired of Steak Shapiro on 92.9 the Game).... You all don't realize how difficult it is to find a superstar in this league... let alone let it land to you..... after the 1988 Hawks lost a heartbreaker to Larry Bird's Celtics in the Eastern Semis, it took us 27 years... TWENTY SEVEN years to have a team that good again... it wasn't until the 2015 Hawks when we finally got to the ECF. Nothing is promised to a franchise...

then Trae Young landed to us in 2018... our best superstar since Dominque Wilkins... that's about 30+ years it took. We've never been in position to draft the #1 pick while already having a superstar in this city in our franchise history... and for all the pundits who say this draft class is really bad... players can be developed... look at where Nikola Jokic went overall... same with the NFL... there's 2nd, 3rd, 4th round, etc. draft picks who surprise everyone when they weren't projected to be good at all.

We better not overthink this and just draft Alex Sarr... make some trades for bigger guys and most importantly... veteran leadership presence... Oh... last time I checked... Dallas has 2 superstars... and 1 of them is superstar AND veteran leadership presence (Kyrie Irving). That MATTERS... and Trae Young has never had that other superstar next to him.. Luka has that with Kyrie... Dallas made the better moves as a franchise... and they've shown they can win a NBA title cuz they did it back in 2011. If Luka was here and Trae was in Dallas... Dallas would've made better moves around Trae.... while Atlanta would've made horrible moves around Luka...

so please stop comparing the players... I'm tired of this as well. Do we forget that the Mavericks were 11th in the Western conference and missed the playoffs last season? They didn't even make the play in last season... and look at the turn around they've had this year. So anything is possible with the Hawks... I just don't know if I trust this front office anymore.",AtlantaHawks,173,https://www.reddit.com/r/AtlantaHawks/comments/1d1v2xb/sick_tired_of_the_trae_young_hate/

2024-05-16,1715894111,"""If Sarr, Buzelis, and Holland just would have went to college they're probably the consensus top 3 picks and we're not calling this a weak draft. If Sarr goes to Kentucky he's dominating defensively, catching a lot of lob dunks and being compared to Anthony Davis."" - Tyler Jones
","Tyler Jones made this great point on the newest Locked on Hawks podcast and I couldn't agree more!  

I've been saying for months now that I thought this draft isn't as weak as everyone says.  I think that the formative age that this class was during the covid lockdowns/disruption had a huge affect, and as Rowland and Jones discussed these guys have ""unconventional"" tape. 

That unconventional tape comes from a few of the guys being on G-league ignite which was a huge dumpster fire and I'm sure everyone regrets being there and it did nobody any favors.  Nobody improved from their G-League ignite experience.

Then you have Sarr who was at overtime elite for 2 years which is an irregular approach in itself and then he went to Australia.  According to the Perth fan that posted here recently it sounds like Sarr was basically playing for Australian Nate McMillan and showcasing Sarr and developing his NBA skills were not a priority for them as they were in contention and trying to win games.  Sarr is also a young, skinny big man and it can't be easy to go from playing high school aged guys to playing against big men in their prime in a pro league.  I agree with Tyler, if we only had tape on Sarr playing against other 19-21 year old big men his tape would be more impressive.

  
I mean hey it's easy for me to say all of this as a Hawks fan, right?  Maybe these players weren't super affected by not being able to play much organized basketball when they were 14-15 because of covid, but at the very least these prospects took unconventional paths towards getting the the draft.  And instead of all of these scouts and analysts saying ""Hey this draft class is unique and is harder to project because of x, y, and z variables"" they're saying ""yeah this is the worst draft I've seen"" and are being completely inflexible in their evaluations.  It almost feels like at this point no one will dare say that they think this is a good draft because they don't want to disagree with the hive mind and isolate themselves if their wrong.

Keep in mind, this was before Risacher was even considered a lottery lock. Was this a random prediction? No. Ive been following this kid for years and I noticed early on how intelligent he was on the court, playing against grown men since he was a young teen. 

He may not be the most polished as of today, but Im confident hes going to be very good in the future just based on how good of a feel he has for the game. Hes shown flashes of elite shooting, elite defense and elite off-ball movement. 

Im standing by my prediction, we got a good one guys, hang in there.

2024-03-29,1711686262,Thank you for this Unforgettable experience,"I am from Germany and Monday was my first NBA game. People in this subreddit told me not to come and watch the Hawks because the team wasnt as good. Then Trae (my favorite player and one of the main reasons I flew here) got injured and I was disappointed. After Mondays historical 30 point comeback I was so excited and hyped because I have never experienced such a intense atmosphere. 
Then I also went to Wednesdays game and it was also a good game. There werent as many blazers fans so the atmosphere was one sided.
And tonight I also watched the game against the Celtics. I have to be honest and admit that I thought that it would be a complete blowout. But as the game continued I was confident that this would be a great game aswell. The atmosphere was so f* great all game long. A positive factor was probably the fact that many Celtics fans were there so it felt like a competition to cheer louder than the opposing fans. Then I was allowed to watch a overtime live with a game winner.

I am so grateful for this experience and happy that I came here even though many told me not to come. Unfortunately I didnt see Trae Young playing live which I was hoping for as hes my favorite player and I am not sure if I am able to come back to Atlanta / the Us in the next years.  

I wanted to thank all Hawks fans out there for making this an unforgettable experience and the Celtics fans aswell because the atmosphere wouldnt be as great without them as it thrives the fans, or it least it felt like this to me. Sadly this was my last game and I wont be able to watch Saturdays game live.

Thank you all so much for making this unforgettable week reality for me.

2024-10-18,1729221064,"After the preseason, Im very worried about this year","After these preseason games Im not optimistic about watching this team. 

Were gonna be so dominant that games are gonna stop being fun to watch after a while. Sure, the first 30 or so games where we win by 150 will be fun, but eventually its gonna be like playing the CPU in 2k on rookie difficulty: whats the point? The playoffs may be better but even then, you might as well wait until the end of game 4 of the finals to tune in.

I fear we made a mistake bringing in guys like Dyson and Zacc and sticking with Trae and JJ, because this team will simply be too good for any game to be competitive.",AtlantaHawks,30,https://www.reddit.com/r/AtlantaHawks/comments/1g68ojv/after_the_preseason_im_very_worried_about_this/
