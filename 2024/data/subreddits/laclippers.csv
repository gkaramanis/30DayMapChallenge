(These are sourced from Basketball Reference btw)

KD has:

- 1x MVP
- 2x Finals MVP
- 4x Scoring Titles
- 14x Time All-Star
- 6x All-NBA First Team
- 4x All-NBA Second team
- 1x ROTY

Kawhi WOULD have:

- 3x Finals MVP
- 1x Steals Leader
- 6x All-Star
- 3x All-NBA First Team
- 2x All-NBA Second Team
- 3x NBA All-Defensive First Team
- 4x NBA All-Defensive Second Team
- 1x Rookie All First Team

While I do think it would be close, I still would probably lean Kevin Durant which pains me as a Clippers Fan (Dont laugh).

What do you think? Do you think maybe not now, but he could pass him later?

I'm not even a clippers fan, I joined this sub just to see if anyone has ever seen anything like this before lol it's as if the NBA is going out of its way to entirely cover up that first half as if it never happened, and are even potentially striking smaller youtube channels that tried uploading it, cause idk why else a clippers fan page wouldn't want to show that shit.",LAClippers,71,https://www.reddit.com/r/LAClippers/comments/1c0mx8m/why_is_the_first_half_being_hidden/

Then lets develop the young fellas, scout the European leagues for talent rather than waiting for draft picks, look through the g league just like Miami seem to succeed at every year, look through the pool of undrafted guys, find the guys that have potential but rot on the bench (or niche roles) for other teams and just need a chance. Again, lets just do something to mix it up. 

The current 6th man of the year happens to be the EXACT type of guy we need in our team and guess what? Naz Reid was undrafted.

2024-04-29,1714412210,Positive thing to look out for: Russell Westbrook is a home court player. He might have a redemption game in him in GAME5. ,"I was listening to The Lob The Jam with Andrew Greif and he was talking about Russell Westbrook and he described an interesting story about his pre-game routine. 

Before every game Russell Westbrook is standing at the end of the court and looks up to the stands. Looking as far and high as possible looking for something. 

When asked about what he's looking for he answered that before every game he's trying to find one person looking at him and being supportive screaming ""Go Russ!"" or holding a poster rooting for him. He does that to find the last spark of motivation and energy before tip-off. 

Russell is powered by the fans. And we've seen this both in his time with the Clippers and - especially - Lakers that when fans manage to get in his head he's losing it. With the crowd against him he often starts to lose his cool and play negative basketball. 

I believe that getting home, seeing a supportive crowd and having good vibes around him could do wonders to how he performs. 

I believer we might see a redemption game from Russ in GAME5 and that can be a difference maker.

2024-08-02,1722638779,Flagship store opening and Intuit Dome tour ,"Made it out to the opening of the flagship store this afternoon. Besides the store, the plaza area was open which includes an outdoor basketball court, huge high definition screen, and art fixtures. DJ Dense was spinning and Cam Christie was there for a bit signing autographs. The store was large and well stocked with a wide range of designs similar to what you can find online. Purchases also included a free tumbler while supplies last.

The team was offering tours for $50, and I would highly recommend! The tour started with access to the upper bowl before moving to the lower bowl and wall. Not to rehash everything that has been written about Intuit Dome, but it is a truly state of the art facility. The seats are comfortable and roomy as advertised. The screen, which stretches all the way around the arena, is remarkable and can be seen with ease from any seat in the house. Overall, the sight lines and distance to the court, even in the upper bowl, offer a clear and close view. We also check out the lounge and club areas which are very nice.

The coolest part of the tour though, which we were asked not to photograph, was the practice court and locker room area. Ive been in a few locker rooms on various tours and this one is truly luxurious. I cant imagine that the level of the facilities isnt a huge draw in our ability to land elite coaches and staff and perhaps even players. Our group also ran into President of Business Operations Gillian Zucker who was quite personable. 

There are so many details Im leaving out for brevity but the main point is Intuit Dome totally lives up to the hype as perhaps the most luxurious, tech forward, overall nicest arenas the world has ever seen, no joke. Needless to say, Crypto isnt even in the same universe. If we can field a championship level team alongside it in the coming years, I can totally see the Clippers transforming into a premier NBA brand.

FYI, if you make it out, I would recommend you download and register a profile on the Intuit Dome app because youre asked to create a profile prior to entry. The app also allows you to make purchases at the store and Dome without having to check out with anyone due to the incorporation of facial recognition. 

Anyhow, just thought Id share and encourage anyone who may be nearby to check it out this weekend. However it plays out on the court this season, no doubt that there are bright days ahead for Clippers fans!",LAClippers,45,https://www.reddit.com/r/LAClippers/comments/1einljx/flagship_store_opening_and_intuit_dome_tour/

2024-07-19,1721417871,Good riddance.,"No hate towards PJ, just doesn't have a spot on this weirdly reformed version of the Clippers.

Hopefully Bones is included (has potential but will never hit it as a 3rd/4th string guard) and if it really comes down to it, norm or t-mann, or even both depending on the return.

I have a feeling Ty lue is actually gonna give Moussa, Miller and Kobe a go, this year in the rotations, but if it isn't shaping up by the deadline, I think a bigger move is to be made (especially for a mid-tier PF like around the level of John Collins, Kyle Kuzma, Tari Eason) but will probably require a 3rd team for it to happen.

We have like 7-9 rotation-level+ players that are under 6'6 (Harden, Kris, T-Mann, Norm, PJ Tucker, KPJ, DJJ and possibly Jordan Miller and Cam Christie). Its just too many.

2024-09-28,1727484031,Clippers spent $230m this summer. Pg got paid over 92% of that amount in Philly. Heres who Clippers took instead ,"From what I understand of the situation (according to PG) clippers offered Paul somewhere between 3 years-$135m-150m contract and he declined for the following reasons; wanted 4th year, wanted a no-trade clause, wanted more $ per year than initial offers. 

Max that the clippers could have offered is $212m for 4 years which he accepted in free agency with the 76ers. 

Mann just accepted a 3 year-$47m extension. Zubac got a 3 year-$59m extension. Harden took 2 years-$70m. Derrick jones got 3 years-$30m. Picked up Kris Dunn from the Jazz who is owed $16m over next 3 years. Kpj did 2 years-$5m. Mo bamba-1 year $2.5m.

Thats **$230m of salary committed** this **summer** over the next 3 years. Pg just got paid over 92% of that in Philly over the next 4 years. 

Earlier this year in January and April respectively clippers paid Kawhi 3 years-$150 &amp; Kai jones 1 year-$2.5m.

So imo clippers offered Pg a reasonable contract given his age and signs of decline on defense, pg denied for self stated ego reasons, star hungry morey picked him up for almost same $$ that clippers built most of their rotation with.

Things to know: Despite Norman Powells serious head injury against the pistons, he luckily escaped any serious injury and has not been put into concussion protocol. With Minnesota sitting right at the top of the western conference a game ahead of the Clippers, a win tonight would put them back at the top of the conference, continuing what has been an amazing run for this Clippers team.

Everyone will admit that. But nobody can convince me, in 2019, you wouldn't make that trade if you were the GM of the team.

We traded all those assets mainly because it also meant getting Kawhi, the man who had just won the FMVP after one of the most dominant individual playoff runs in NBA history. No elite superstar player had ever been acquired through free agency during our franchise's history. We had arguably the best player in the world willing to sign with us &amp; bring along a guy who just finished top 3 in MVP voting the same season. We would've been idiots to tell that man ""naw, that's okay, sign with somebody else"".

Hindsight is 2020. It's easy to say we made a mistake now looking at how things have turned out. Was SGA a good rookie with all-star potential? Yes, but nobody can convince me they thought he was gonna be averaging over 30 ppg &amp; be a perennial MVP candidate at only 25 years old.

Was Kawhi injury prone when we signed him? Yes, but nobody could have predicted he would only be healthy in 1 out of 5 seasons come playoff time. (By the way, Fuck Joe Ingles).

The trade looks terrible now considering all the things that have went down since then, but you gotta put context behind why we made it at that time.",LAClippers,183,https://www.reddit.com/r/LAClippers/comments/1cnyxqc/all_the_i_miss_shai_worst_trade_ever_posts_are/

2024-05-02,1714636029,Westbrook has made 6 out of his 35 shots in our last 4 games,"Westbrook in his last four games: 6-35 FG. That's a smoking hot 17% from the field.

He also has a total of 5 assists on 6 turnovers.

That's not one, two or even three games. It's four games of shitting himself on a national TV. 

I want Russ' stans to explain what this man is doing, because he surely is not playing a game of basketball. If he's our bench ""come on, guys"" player, our Thanasis on a minimum, I get that. But the thing is, during the playoffs Thanasis stays on the bench. Westbrook plays 20+ minutes a game. That's 20 minutes of LA Clippers playing 4-on-5 on offense. 

As for the defense, you can't hustle a win from Dallas the way Westbrook did against the Suns. They are smarter, they have depth to adapt. Russ can't be as methodical as we need, like TMann. He's too impulsive. Go to that 38:33 moment, where on an inbound play Westbrook decided to double Lively on the perimeter and left red-hot Kleber open for his third 3-pointer. 

I know everyone's blaming Harden and PG. I agree about the latter, but to me Harden was expected to have a stinker. We relied too much on him, he's clearly exhausted.

2024-03-26,1711470794,"""We have no identity."" -PG ""We have to at least play hard."" -Kawhi","These are the faces of the Clippers. These guys ARE the identity of the Clippers. These guys ARE the guys that have to set the tone for playing hard. These guys ARE the two that need to motivate the other's to step up their games. It will forever baffle me that in year five of the 213 era, we have our star players saying things like this. No identity? YOU TWO ARE THE ONLY CONSISTENT THINGS OVER THE LAST FIVE YEARS. You two are responsible for creating the identity you so desire.

This is exactly what I mean by there is no leadership on this team. PG and Kawhi just don't have it in them to lead men. They don't. Does Ty Lue? It doesn't seem like it either. Ty seems like the coach that lets the players run the show, which worked with LeBron, but will NOT work for PG and Kawhi.

2024-02-28,1709079157,How would you rate the new rebrand? Personally Id give the rebrand as a whole an 8/10,"The uniforms are a solid upgrade from the previous minimalist theme we had from 2018-2024. Theyre a good mix of simplicity and a little flare. You cant forget about the touch of nostalgia, with the classic cursive font on the front as well as the nautical theme from the 1970s and 1980s. The only thing Id add is maybe a white outline outside of the wording for the red and blue jerseys, and a red outline for the white jersey (someone made a post about that yesterday). The sides of the jersey with all the nautical flags is cool too and reminds me of the shorts on the 2013 Alternate powder blue sleeved unis. Biases aside, these are one of the better uniforms in the NBA. 

The logo is pretty hit or miss. Personally, Im kinda digging the big ship in the front. Not many nautical themed teams in the NBA which sets us apart from the pack. The logo does kind of fall into the minimalist circle trap that many other NBA teams fall into where their main logo is just a basic circle with the team name on the outer band of the circle. The LA secondary logo however goes hard and I love it

Lastly, the new court is ok I guess. They couldve added more colors, specifically red, but Im fine with it. Overall, Id say this rebrand represents Southern California well and is really what the franchise needed.

2024-05-31,1717137451,Stop patting yourself on the backs for going to 6 against Dallas& this is just sad ,"We got served a first round exit while watching the ugliest offensive basketball all season and now a lot of people here or on twitter are celebrating that we won two while Minnesota won just one?! 

First of all - they won with PHX in 4, they won with Denver in 7 and they got to the WCF.
Meanwhile we're the oldest team in the NBA celebrating moral victories while watching other teams play for the last month because our team went down.  

Second of all - have you heard about momentum? Sometimes the first round is worse for some teams than the rest of playoffs because they just had to get the wheels rolling. Yeah we won two and Wolves won one. But in our series Luka was a shell of himself and we all noticed that. If he was playing against us like he did the other two times we met them in the POs it would be Dallas in 4. 

And third of all - how would you feel if in 2021 Lakers celebrated winning 2 games against PHX in first round when we lost to them in 6 in WCF? You'd call that loser mentality. And that's what it is. One team made it to the WCF finals going through amazing teams, the other got bounced and went home in first round. True in 2021 and true now. 

Stop pretending Wolves' performance in WCF is in any way comparable to ours and just give Dallas their flowers for getting red hot when it was needed most. Not like we can expect the same from our team... 

With that said - Go Clips! 

P.s. can't wait for comments with another trick in the moral victories bag - ""If Kawhi was healthy we would've won this round"". Yeah - we probably would've because the first round Dallas was not the same team we see now. But Kawhi wasn't playing. And we lost.

Firstly, have to give credit to the lakers for showing tremendous fight and exploiting our weaknesses amazingly well in that 4th. They showed us how its done.

With that said, if we cant keep our composure when Kawhi goes off for a brief breather. We are nooo where near close to championship level. Sports is all about momentum and we served that up on a big ol platter, all you can eat. 

Plumlee sucks. He runs around with the knees of a 40 year old retired dirk norwitzki. Looks like he might topple over at any moment. PJ does fuck all but at least he always does that so hes consistent.

The rest just looked clueless and scared without Kawhi to carry them. Then finally, our usual weakness came back to bite us. No PF or length to guard Lebron and then get a rebound once they missed.

Dont even get me started on Ty Lues dumb ass.

2024-02-26,1708966430,A simple stroke would improve the jerseys dramatically in my opinion.,"As Im sure you all know, the Clippers just announced a rebrand and I think that overall it looks great. The one thing that really bugs me though is how hard the jerseys are to read. Maybe its nitpicking but adding a simple stroke to the lettering really helps make it easier to read, especially from a distance. 

This is actually a very real phenomena known as chromostereopsis which is defined as a visual illusion that occurs when certain colors are placed alongside each other, making it unnecessarily difficult to focus on both colors. This is due to the way that wavelengths stimulate different areas within the eye. Red-Blue and Red-Green are the two most common problematic color combos but there are others. 

I am not a Clippers fan but when I saw the jerseys I thought they could be fixed rather easily. So I threw them into photoshop and put a super simple stroke around the lettering and I think that it greatly improves legibility and I like the extra white that it adds to the jerseys. I wanted to share with this sub since you all have much more vested interest than I do. Do you think they should have added a stroke to the jerseys or are you happy with them the way that they are?

2024-07-30,1722357852,should kawhi leonard get breast implants?,"i was thinking about how many injuries to the head players on our squads have sustained during the 213 era. obviously kawhi had to get stitches after catching serge's elbow to the mouth, norm making friends with jalen duren's elbow, hell even our opponents too - book broke his nose during our wcf run and recently walker kessler had to sit out against us because he broke his nose too. hits to the face can dramatically alter one's appearance, so it got me thinking, have any recent players went under the knife for cosmetic purposes? i looked it up, and no results. 

but could plastic surgery be used as an advantage for nba players? i went to the rule book, i looked up plastic surgery - no results. 

then i looked up breast implants - no results. 

so i think theoretically kawhi could get as many breast implants imbedded underneath his skin as possible. we all know how injury prone he is so he could use them as cushions to take more hits on defense, he could be an even better post defender, maybe he could use them to absorb more contact or prevent more injuries whenever he attacks the rim. speaking of injuries, kawhi's knees are on suicide watch. we're all aware of his deteriorating ligaments, so if we were to imbed breast implants in his knees, i feel like they'd not only have more protection, but have more functionality as well. he'd be more fluid on offense, more active on defense, and he wouldnt have to hesitate or even think about getting hurt as much with breast implants on his side (literally) 

last season kawhi had the 2nd highest ts% out of every small forward in the league at .626% (2nd to lebron). we all know kawhi likes his middy's, so whenever he's backing a guy down with a body full of breast implants, he could probably overpower them and shoot somewhere in the 80's. literally automatic. increasing your body area could also help you draw more fouls, and we all know kawhi's automatic from the charity stripe

now let's think of the logistics. breast implants can be LARGE. for the sake of this hypothetical scenario i'm gonna assume kawhi would be ok with 300cc implants. i did some calculations on his body, he's 6'7, 225lbs, hands are 9.75in in length 11.25in in width, wears size 14 shoes and has a 7'3 wingspan - but take into consideration that he'd still have to slip on shoes, dribble, and see (so minus .43sqft from his skull, .76sqft from his big ass hands, and .42sqft from his feet). kawhi would have an astonishing 25.36 sqft of bodily surface area (via du bois formula). now according to Boston Plastic Surgery Specialists, 300cc Mentor High Profile Smooth Implants (?) are .35sqft in area, which means you could stuff 72 300cc breast implants in kawhi leonard's body!!!!!! 300cc implants weigh about .65lbs each, so he'd have to take on 47lbs but really who cares? it's just a matter of conditioning at this point. cost doesn't matter either, ballmers pockets are so fat he walks around with a limp and shit he probably personally knows the best plastic surgeon in brazil

so should we do it? it's an untapped avenue no team has even thought about going down, and it means our franchise guy would probably play every game of the season (assuming none of the implants pop or something). with the new arena and kawhi being available every night, ticket sales would be through the roof and who knows, maybe we'd have our best shot at winning a title

tl;dr kawhi leonard can stuff 72 300cc breast implants in his body",LAClippers,66,https://www.reddit.com/r/LAClippers/comments/1efy6d3/should_kawhi_leonard_get_breast_implants/
