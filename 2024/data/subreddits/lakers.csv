How a franchise treats its stars matters. A lot. I remember the days when the Lakers were getting rejected by fringe stars like LaMarcus Aldridge. I also remember the days when the Lakers were a prime destination for stars. Even when they were not able to make the moves happen, players like Kevin Garnett (pre-Boston) really wanted to find themselves in LA. Kareem. Shaq. Our team his a rich history of being a destination for stars. A big part of that is that we were always seen as a place that takes care of its star players.

Rejecting LeBron is going to be a massive stain on this franchise, one we will regret for a long time.

On the court, I believe in our ability to build a team to compete during this coming off season. If we can get even a somewhat competent head coach, and get Vando healthy, we will be in a strong position, with three first round picks tradable and a bunch of salary that is movable, to upgrade key positions. But we will not recover if the Lakers are known as the team that fumbled the last few seasons of the most legendary player of the modern era, and one of the top two most legendary players in history.",lakers,399,https://www.reddit.com/r/lakers/comments/1b0sm4t/if_its_true_that_lebron_wants_a_3_year_60_million/

There were no terrible ""Taurean at the 4"" lineups. He called timeouts at the perfect time, at the hint of any Pelicans momentum. He basically coached a flawless game. 

Which drives me nuts because if this Darvin Ham was our coach all season we'd have easily been a top 4 team in the west. We've seen Darvin Ham coach well before, he outcoached Steve Kerr last year in the playoffs, he did a fairly good job throughout the IST. 

So, why did we have a bottom 3 coach on our sidelines for a huge chunk of the season if he was capable of better?

2024-05-20,1716178420,Karma is real Mike Malone. Learn to be humble when you are up and when everything is going right for you.,"I didn't want to jinx the wolves when they were up 2-0. But when the Nuggets won 3 in a row, I honestly lost hope.

But as I said Karma catches up quick. 

The Nuggets both in last season and this season scraped through us though the 4-0 and 4-1 scorelines suggest otherwise. The margins were minimal.

They were fully healthy last season and it took an injured Lebron, Non performing Dlo for them to get through.

This season as well - everyone was available for them, we didn't have Vando, Gabe was barely game ready, our POA defense was nowhere near optimal, and they scraped through again thanks to not ONE but TWO game winners by Murray.

Also, We had HAM. Our Most important weakness.

It irked me to no extent when the Nuggets (mainly Mike Malone) was more focused on us than even winning the Championship. 

The main reason I supported the Wolves Is not just due to Nuggets hate, but I liked Anthony Edwards attitude. Calm and composed, no arrogance and a classy player (not in-game i agree but post game - always respects the opponent, takes responsibility for his mistakes)

So ya, sorry for the long essay but I had it in my chest for too long and had to vent.

Let's regroup and get back to our winning ways next season.

For now, GO Wolves, Fuck Boston.

2024-05-01,1714581319,"[Brett Siegel] LeBron James is expected to opt out of his contract with the Lakers to become a free agent, sources told @ClutchPoints.  In doing so, James upcoming offseason decisions will be influenced by his connections with Steph Curry and Kevin Durant.","Saw this on the timeline, so I thought that I might as well share!

Some highlights from the piece:

* Early indications point toward the 20-time All-Star opting out of his contract in order to create flexibility by becoming an unrestricted free agent for what could be the final time in his career, league sources told ClutchPoints. Should LeBron opt out of his contract, the Lakers are not prepared to give up on the league's all-time scorer, as they hope to keep James in Los Angeles until he is ready to retire.

* While the 21-year veteran has backed off slightly on the narrative of playing alongside his son before he retires when speaking with reporters, James truly wants to play on the same team as Bronny, sources said.

* The New Orleans Pelicans do reserve the rights to own the Lakers' 17th overall selection this season, but the belief amongst league circles is that the Pelicans will decline this option for 2025 instead.

* The idea of moving on from Ham is another influence on James' decision this offseason, league sources confirmed. Executive Rob Pelinka and owner Jeanie Buss are expected to consult with LeBron, among others, before making a final decision on whether Ham will return for his third season with the Lakers. The overwhelming belief across league circles is that the Lakers will fire Ham and look to replace him with a coach who can bring out the championship potential of this roster by being the leading voice in the locker room.

* Leading up to the start of Team USA training camp in July, LeBron is not only expected to opt out of his contract with the Lakers for the 2024-25 season but actively lay out all of his options moving forward, sources said, with Curry and Durant potentially playing a role in what James decides to do.

* The possibility of teaming up with the Warriors is something Curry will undoubtedly talk with James about leading up to free agency and the start of Team USA training camp, sources said. With LeBron expected to seriously give thought to other opportunities entering what could be his final free agency, Durant is another voice James will listen to, given the Suns' need for help in their quest for a championship.

* Winning a third championship would do a lot for Durant's legacy, and he is going to do what it takes to make this happen. Whether that means he remains in Phoenix or jumps ship to another team is a whole separate conversation.

* Could LeBron leave Los Angeles and head to the desert to create the best quartet this league has ever seen? On the flip side of things, would Durant entertain the idea of requesting a trade from the Suns in order to go to the Lakers? =@

* Even though there is a strong belief that he will ultimately remain with the Lakers, the notion that James is going to give thought to what Curry and Durant have to say to him this offseason is very telling as to what he is thinking. Still, the overarching belief is that James will simply hear out the ideas presented to him rather than seriously consider leaving the Lakers, league sources said. LeBron declining to engage in the trade conversations involving him and the Warriors at the trade deadline gave Buss and the Lakers more confidence that their superstar is not leaving anytime soon.

* No matter what happens with everything else, the Lakers remain committed to winning, with James being the face of the franchise.",lakers,312,https://www.reddit.com/r/lakers/comments/1chqlht/brett_siegel_lebron_james_is_expected_to_opt_out/

2024-09-25,1727224498,"Darvin Ham needed eight months and nearly 50 games to land a starting lineup, JJ Redick needed two months and zero games. Redick revealed on Wednesday that he's already settled on his starting lineup: D'Lo, Reaves, Rui, LeBron and AD","Darvin Ham needed roughly eight months between the offseason and regular season to land on his starting lineup. JJ Redick needed two months on the job.

Throughout recent years, Lakers head coaches have kept starting fives close to the vest, to say the least. Both Frank Vogel and Ham gained reputations for never revealing their starting lineups until it was absolutely necessary.

JJ Redick isnt following that mold.

Despite being nearly a month away from the first game of the regular season and still a week out from even the start of training camp, Redick has already landed on his starting five. And on top of that, hes already willingly sharing it publicly.

Redick appeared on The Lowe Post podcast with Zach Lowe on Tuesday and, when asked if he had settled on a starting lineup, he simply...revealed the lineup. What a novel concept!

Itll be the starting five that went 23-10 last year.

Well, there goes a preseason storyline. And, to be clear, the lineup he is referring to DAngelo Russell, Austin Reaves, Rui Hachimura, LeBron James and Anthony Davis.

To be fair, there may not actually be much to debate about that lineup. The only realistic change that could be made is inserting Jarred Vanderbilt for Hachimura. However, if reports are to be believed, Vando might not even be ready from the jump this preseason, which pretty much makes the decision an easy one.

After spending last summer talking about continuity and then not leaning into that last season, the Lakers are, at the very least, going to ride that continuity this season with this lineup. In those final 33 games, only one other lineup  the Pacers starting five  played more minutes together in the entire NBA.

The Lakers found ways to leverage their size with that starting five and it really ignited Hachimura as well. The team also found success with that group in games LeBron sat out as well.

Now, the starting five struggled in the playoffs against Denver, but the likely hope is that a season of playing together and figuring out how to correct the weakness will only make them stronger.

And even when they struggled, the Lakers led for the vast majority of the series as well, so the struggles werent that great in context.

This is also just a general change for the Lakers, too, as its been some time since fans have known what the starting five would be heading into the season. Youd have to go back to the 2020-21 season after the Lakers won the title to have a year in which the team entered camp and the season aware of what its starting group would look like.",lakers,165,https://www.reddit.com/r/lakers/comments/1foruxr/darvin_ham_needed_eight_months_and_nearly_50/

2024-06-27,1719455341,Where Dalton Knecht ranked in mock drafts:,"Here's where Dalton Knecht ranked in a number of final mock 2024 drafts.

[ESPN](https://www.espn.com/nba/insider/story/_/id/40403204/2024-nba-mock-draft-latest-first-second-round-predictions-all-58-picks): 6. Charlotte Hornets
Knecht's draft range appears increasingly small, with teams picking from Nos. 4 to 9 all expressing significant interest, except for Detroit at No. 5.
Charlotte has worked out Knecht, and his fit alongside LaMelo Ball and Brandon Miller appears to be strong with the perimeter shooting and all-around scoring prowess Knecht offers. If Knecht isn't picked at No. 6, it might be because a player such as Sheppard or Castle (both of whom Charlotte has worked out) is available.
Rival teams say they would be surprised to see Knecht fall past both the Portland Trail Blazers and San Antonio at No. 7 and No. 8, where he also seems to be coveted. Buzelis worked out with Charlotte, as well, along with Ja'Kobe Walter and Cody Williams. -- Givony

[Yahoo Sports](https://sports.yahoo.com/2024-nba-mock-draft-100-updated-predictions-plus-the-latest-intel-on-draft-day-155833888.html): #6 to Charlotte Hornets
The Hornets could be looking to move up to No. 3 to possibly draft Castle before hes available at No. 4 to the Spurs, but if a trade cant happen, Knecht is a good backcourt option to add to LaMelo Ball and Brandon Miller. He's an older, experienced guard who was the best scorer in the SEC this season and can give solid minutes right away.

[NBC Sports](https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/basketball/news/2024-nba-mock-draft-round-1-and-2): 6. Charlotte Hornets
While the Hornets had another rough season, Brandon Millers progression was a silver lining in that cloud. The second overall pick in last summers draft, he earned first-team All-Rookie honors and still has not reached his full potential. How Miller and new head coach and former Celtics assistant Charles Lee mesh will significantly impact the future of the Hornets franchise. The questions lingering over the roster are about the health of LaMelo Ball and Mark Williams, as well as what will happen with pending free agent Miles Bridges. A player like Knecht, who can score on all three levels, could work well alongside Miller. He wasnt much of a creator for others during his lone season at Tennessee, but the Volunteers needed him to be a scorer. There are also strides for Knecht to make defensively, but he isnt a complete liability on that end of the floor.

[USA Today](https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/nba/draft/2024/06/11/nba-mock-draft-2024-alex-sarr-zaccharie-risacher/74030208007/): 6. Charlotte Hornets
Strong on catch-and-shoot 3s, can drive to the basket with power and finesse and is athletic. Will need work defensively, and yes, hell be 23 years old by the draft, but that shouldnt be a detractor. He delivered great offensive performances late in the season, scoring 40 against Kentucky and 37 against Purdue in the Elite Eight.

[The Athletic](https://www.nytimes.com/athletic/5528904/2024/06/05/nba-mock-draft-2024-vecenie-alex-sarr/): 6. Charlotte Hornets
The Hornets pick is seen as an inflection point, as teams around the league are unclear on the direction new head of basketball operations Jeff Peterson will take. Peterson was an assistant general manager in Brooklyn and Atlanta during times when his teams made varied picks. Knecht makes sense as a way to accentuate the trio of Miller, LaMelo Ball and Mark Williams, which the organization views as its core moving forward. Knecht scored at a dizzying pace, averaging 25.5 points in 18 SEC games while shooting 48.4 percent from the field and 42.4 percent from 3.
Overall, he averaged 21.7 points per game on 46 percent from the field, but those stats are dragged down by a stretch during which he played at less than 100 percent following an ankle injury. His offense should translate to NBA settings. Not only is he a terrific shooter, especially off movement, but also hes a higher-end athlete than most shooters who can sky in transition and finish inside with hang time. Hed open up a ton of space for Ball and Miller.

[Bleacher Report](https://www.nba.com/news/bleacher-report-top-5-shakeup-in-latest-mock-draft): 10. Utah Jazz
Pro Comparison: Wally Szczerbiak
After drafting three freshmen in last years first round, the Utah Jazz may be more inclined to add an NBA-ready player with a coveted, surefire skill. There is a level of certainty tied to Dalton Knechts shooting and shotmaking versatility. Hes an easy offensive fit with his off-ball skill set, though tough drives and athletic finishes in transition suggest Knecht has more to his game than a specialists.
Were hearing the interest in Knecht starts at No. 6 with the Hornets. But teams more enticed by younger prospects with theoretical higher ceilings could allow Utah to grab the 23-year-old at No. 10.

[SB Nation](https://www.sbnation.com/nba/2024/6/18/24179880/nba-mock-draft-2024-after-nba-finals-latest-rumors): 13. Sacramento Kings
This feels like the low-end for Knechts range in the draft, with the Blazers lurking as his floor with the next pick. Knecht fits Sacramentos existing style well: hes a high-volume, highly-accurate three-point shooter for a team that finished No. 3 in three-point rate last season. Sacramento could probably use a little more size at this pick, but Knecht feels like a plug-and-play option for a team that wants to stay competitive in the West.

[The Ringer](https://nbadraft.theringer.com/mock-draft): 8 San Antonio Spurs
The Spurs badly need shooting to create more space for Wemby to destroy the rimand Knecht would provide immediate help along with some on-ball chops. Going with two wings/forwards may go against the grain for the Spurs with so many guards available. But maybe theyll instead dip into the trade market to find their guard for the present and future, rather than rely on a rookie to adjust and create good looks.

[CBS Sports](https://www.cbssports.com/nba/news/2024-nba-mock-draft-frances-zaccharie-risacher-taken-by-hawks-with-top-pick-alex-sarr-falls-to-no-2/): 6 Charlotte Hornets
The intel out of Charlotte is that they would like either a 2 or 4 in this draft to add to the young core of Brandon Miller, LaMelo Ball and Mark Williams. Knecht is the best available at either of those positions and also one of the more NBA-ready perimeter scorers in the draft. Personally though, I'd give Holland a long look here.

[No Celings](https://www.noceilingsnba.com/p/2024-nba-mock-draft-v7): #5 Detroit Pistons
Paige: I know theres been some talk about the Pistons wanting to go with Matas Buzelis here, and I do understand the vision. However, if they have the option to pick up arguably the most pure shooter in the draft class and a prospect who can come in and take over games offensively, it would be a no-brainer for the Pistons to select Dalton Knecht. The 66 wing out of Tennessee shot 39.7 3PT% overall this past season, 42.4% off the catch, and 44.7% as a spot-up shooter for the Volunteers. The Pistons were 26th in the league in three-point percentage (34.8%) this year, so adding Knecht to the roster would obviously help with floor spacing and creating more room for Cade Cunningham, Jaden Ivey, Marcus Sasser, and Ausar Thompson to operate.
Knecht is also excellent in transition and does the most damage when attacking the rim off live dribbles and using his high basketball IQ to spot-up perfectly for his teammates to find him easily for a bucket. Hes also super capable of pushing the pace on his own as well given that he basically played 1-on-5 against defenses all year long. With Dalton Knecht not having to be the do-it-all guy in Detroit and having the likes of Cade Cunningham to find him in transition, in the corner, off screens, off cuts, in the post, and even off pick-and-roll looks (that would be fun), I would expect a lot more buckets to be Knecht-ed on in Detroit. Along with being a tremendous off-ball shooter, Dalton can still generate his own shot and is the type of player who could contribute right away for a young Detroit team.
