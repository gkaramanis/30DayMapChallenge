2024-07-02,1719881486,"If Klay performs at the same level as last year, He'll be a major addition for the Mavs","This is a *long* post, but I wanted to be thorough. There is a TLDR at the bottom for those that don't care as much about the underlying data!

---

Klay at 50M/3 is absolutely a great bet by the front office, in my opinion (and, he took less than the Lakers' reported 20M/year offer!). Once again, Nico has shown  he is very, very good at his job. And I suspect that a lot of the people who had heartburn at the thought of Klay will be much less concerned now that they're seeing it at a 16M/year deal and the mavs *receiving* picks, vs some 70M+ deal and sending out multiple players or picks.

However, I think this absolutely has the potential to go beyond just a 'smart' move on the margin, but a major, 'cant-believe-people-doubted-this'  idea improvement, at least for the next season.

The team will nominally be starting Klay at the 3, but in terms of his role in the offense, it will almost certainly consist heavily of THJ's old role (though we should expect Kidd, who knows way more about building an offense than we do, to change things up with different personnel). He has two obvious uses within the existing approach:

**1. Klay will get the typical start at the 3, given his pedigree, but where he is most valuable to the team is in the 12-18 minutes a game the Mavs are resting Luka or Kyrie.** The Mavs got better at the trade deadline last year, but they had the *same* weakness they always had: they were reliant on Luka and Kyrie to create *open* looks for role players, ideally near the basket where Mavs were 2nd in FG% after the AS break and the corner (where they were 3rd in FGA per game, but LAST in [corner 3P%](https://www.nba.com/stats/teams/shooting?DistanceRange=By%20Zone&amp;SeasonSegment=Post%20All-Star&amp;dir=D&amp;sort=Restricted%20Area%20FG%20PCT) due to their shooting limitations). When both Kyrie and Luka are on the court, this is tough for a defense to stop, but when there is only one creator on the court, a good defense only has to take away open looks to limit the offense. For all the ""washed"" talk on Klay, this is still a player that is one of the best 3P shooters in the game (more on this below). The minutes where only one of the star guards is out there will be considerably easier to generate and capitalize on open looks now that we are adding a shooter of his caliber. In this part of the game, he will take over the ""THJ"" role.

2\*\*. When Klay, Luka, and Kyrie are on the court together, the spacing will be absolutely ridiculous.\*\* The defense that Boston used to smother us simply does not work anymore, because Klay running off ball screens for catch and shoot 3s is, on average, better than the PPP for some of the best offenses in the league. (we'll get to the defensive concerns later as well).

**Let's start with the THJ baseline to understand why it is almost all upside for Dallas to use Klay for these minutes:**

* 61% of Tim's FGs were 3s, of which 19% where pull ups and 42% were Catch and Shoot. His numbers were pretty average (slightly below) across either category, at about 35% for each. For his 2P shots, he shot nearly no C&amp;S, 18% frequency for pull ups (42% FG), and 18% for &lt;10 ft from the basket (55% FG). This left him with a middling (and below his career average) 52% eFG (1.04 ppp).
   * **On 3s, Tim was a good shooter when** ***wide*** **open (defender 6+ feet), at 43%** (20% of his overall shots), as well as on his wide open 2 PT shots (71%, only 3% of his shots). But **for anything that was just 'open' or tight (2-4 ft ) or very tight (&lt;2), he was mediocre to** ***bad***, shooting 32% and down from 3 and 40-52% from 2.
* **If we compare against Tim's best** [**year**](https://www.nba.com/stats/player/203501/shots-dash?SeasonType=Regular+Season&amp;PerMode=Totals&amp;Season=2020-21) **in 2021, when his eFG was 56% and he was 5th in 6MOTY voting, Tim took 58% of his shots from 3, hit 41% from open (4-6 ft), and a very solid 36% when tightly contested** (2-4 ft).
   * Keep in mind that fairly small differences in points per possession are huge in terms of relative offensive performance. The best offense in the league last year was Boston, at 1.22 [ppp](https://stats.inpredictable.com/nba/ssnTeamPoss.php). You have to shoot 41% from 3 (41% \* 4 = 1.23) to generate that type of offense.The league [average](https://www.basketball-reference.com/leagues/NBA_stats_per_game.html) for 3s was 36.6%. The Mavericks were a hair better than average at 36.9%, while the Thunder and Celtics [led](https://www.statmuse.com/nba/ask/nba-teams-3-point-shooting-rankings-2024) the league at 38.9% and 38.8%, respectively. These #s also show you why falling in love with the wrong 3 point shot is so dangerous -- for most teams the 3 is pulling their offense performance down (1.11 ppp for Dallas vs their 1.16 overall, 1.16 for Boston vs their 1.22)
* So the best version of THJ was shooting 36% on contested 3s, basically giving an 'average' quality 3 shot when defenses are doing a good job.
* **I'm going to zoom in on the contested 3PT% because these are the types of shots you get against good defenses, and in the playoffs; the wide open looks just dry up. In '21, Tim notably was** [**hitting**](https://www.nba.com/stats/player/203501/shooting?SeasonType=Regular+Season&amp;Season=2020-21) **about 39% from both corners and above the break overall, so for Tim at his peak, him taking a 3 was usually a good shot. The catch here was that of the 528 3s he took overall that season, only 112 were tight shots. He was still dependent on the defenses giving him an open look-- otherwise he would  revert to his 36% contested percent.**

By comparison, here's how Klay performed last year, where he was 2nd leading scorer on 30 mpg:

* Much [like](https://www.nba.com/stats/player/202691/shots-dash?SeasonType=Regular+Season&amp;PerMode=Totals) Tim, **about 61% of Klay's shots came from 3. He hit 39% of them**, despite a slow start shooting 36% across October and November before finishing at 42% in March and April.
   * Klay took 50% of 3s on C&amp;S (38% made), with his pull ups being 41% on a smaller sample (not statistically significant difference given the \~100 shots). This compares very favorably to Tim shooting 34% on pull up 3s in 2021, but either way this is a small part of the expected roll
* **What makes Klay such a great shooter, however, is that he is** ***not*** **as dependent on others generating open looks for him to be effective. He shot 40% on tight (defender 2-4 ft) from 3, a fantastic 1.19 ppp (above the Mavericks offense, and ahead of OKC's 3rd ranked offense overall at 1.18).** His % are not statistically significantly different based on distance of defender, at 39% for open and wide open looks. This is surprising, but still very good (and he shot 42% when [open](https://www.nba.com/stats/player/202691/shots-dash?SeasonType=Regular+Season&amp;PerMode=Totals&amp;Season=2022-23) the previous 2 seasons). **This is a huge advantage vs the best THJ has ever contributed to the team, the equivalent of 10.5 points per 100 contested shots.** It is better than [Luka](https://www.nba.com/stats/player/1629029/shots-dash?SeasonType=Regular+Season&amp;PerMode=Totals&amp;Season=2023-24) (34.1%) and [Kyrie](https://www.nba.com/stats/player/202681/shots-dash?SeasonType=Regular+Season&amp;PerMode=Totals&amp;Season=2023-24) (36.7%) in similar shots, and above anything either star has delivered in the past half decade that I checked. **Klay was better than anyone Dallas had last year, stars included, at hitting contested 3s, and he took more (195) tight 3s than Luka and Kyrie combined (189).**

**Klay is not a 'stick him in the corner and hope the defense messes up so he gets an open look' kind of 3P shooter. 597/689 (87%) of his 3P shots (excluding heaves) were above the break.** He shot an excellent 39% above the break on 3s, vs the league average of 36.6% for all 3 pointers. And this is coming despite the fact 29% of his 3s were tightly contested. Tim's best year above the break was also 39% but 88% of his looks were open looks, so much more reliant on open looks to deliver positive value shots.

**The best team in the NBA last year on hitting tightly contested 3s** [**was**](https://www.nba.com/stats/teams/shots-closest-defender?CloseDefDistRange=2-4%20Feet%20-%20Tight&amp;SeasonType=Regular%20Season&amp;dir=D&amp;sort=FG3_PCT) **the LA clippers, at 37.2%. Dallas was 8th in the league at a gross-looking 31.7%. Remember... Klay was hitting these at 40% last year** (with a still excellent 35% the year before on smaller volume)**.** He will *massively* improve the Mavericks shooting, and if teams don't commit to guarding him very closely above the break, he can generate positive offensive possessions.

**All of this is to thoroughly make a pretty simple point: Klay, on a worse GSW team where he was the #2 scorer, was better than anything Dallas has ever gotten from THJ, and better at contested shots than what we got from our stars last year.** You will absolutely find players with higher 3P% of C&amp;S %, but to pick on Grayon Allen, who is cited by a lot of players as one of ""the best"" C&amp;S players this past season: 98% (416/425) of his 3s were open or wide open looks. **I've seen people lazily claim that Klay has fallen to Hield's level of production, and when you control for shot difficulty, you see how wrong these detractors are: Hield, who shot 42% overall** [**from 3**](https://www.nba.com/stats/player/1627741/shots-dash?SeasonType=Regular+Season&amp;PerMode=Totals)**, was a poor 32% on tight shots, and his 37% above the break 3P% was pulled up heavily by his high volume of corner 3s (45% 3P%). Klay took far harder 3 point shots than your average shooter, and hit them at an excellent rate**. **Even other ""elite"" 3P shooters like Derrick** [**White**](https://www.nba.com/stats/player/1628401/shots-dash?SeasonType=Regular+Season&amp;PerMode=Totals) **(28.3% on contested 3s), Sam** [**Hauser**](https://www.nba.com/stats/player/1630573/shots-dash?SeasonType=Regular+Season&amp;PerMode=Totals) **(30%), Michael** [**Porter**](https://www.nba.com/stats/player/1629008/shots-dash?SeasonType=Regular+Season&amp;PerMode=Totals) **Jr (32.5)%, Donte** [**DiVincenzo**](https://www.nba.com/stats/player/1628978/shots-dash?PerMode=Totals&amp;SeasonType=Regular+Season) **(29%), and Mike** [**Conley**](https://www.nba.com/stats/player/201144/shots-dash?SeasonType=Regular+Season&amp;PerMode=Totals) **(17%) owe their shooting % to cherry-picking only open 3s, and many like Donte (38.1%), MPJ (38.7%), and Hield (37.1%) have the same or lower above-the-break shooting %s than Klay, and only have better numbers because they take easier, open corner 3s.**

This is already a very long post, but to address the ""Klay isnt playable on defense"" bit: I believe this to be vastly overblown, in that **while Klay is no longer a plus defender by himself, and there will be some lineups to avoid, he can remain a major net positive when on the court because of how good his shooting is.** When [guarded](https://www.nba.com/stats/players/opponent-shooting?CF=PLAYER_NAME*E*klay&amp;DistanceRange=By%20Zone&amp;PerMode=Totals&amp;SeasonType=Regular%20Season) by Klay, players shot 40% from mid range, 51% from non-RA paint, 40% from corners, and 36% above the break. By comparison, these are better (lower) than the 10th ranked offense for each of these categories averaged: 43.1% from mid range, 45.9% from non-RA paint, 40.6% from corners, 37% from above the break. Klay is not going to be some elite defender, but there's no reason he can be part of a top 10, good team defense if the rotations are as clean as they were this last year\*\*. The GSW defense did not provide the same defensive back stopping at the basket that Dallas' did (they lacked a true center, and relied on guys like Looney at 6'9 to play the part), so it required players to perform at a higher individual level of effort on defense\*\*. There absolutely will be opposing lineups where it doesnt make sense to have all 3 of Luka, Kyrie, and Klay out there, but Klay doesn't need to be out there in all lineups to make this team better. Klay also ranked ahead of the ""better"" defender Andrew Wiggins on his team, at least as far as defensive rating goes, to show how GSW's 15th ranked defense had too many issues on defense to attribute to one person. Dallas acquired Grimes and Marshall for the express reason of having a defensive stopper available for guards and forwards if Klay is not the right matchup. I fully expect them to close with Klay when they need the shooting, and go with defense-maximizing lineups (usually without him) when playing with the lead. I imagine the Mavs analytics team/FO saw the same offensive upside and manageable downside for Klay.

You never know how a player will adjust to a new team or age, but for the price and the expected role, I think it is a great bet.

**The TLDR:**

1. Klay has value to the team to make the non Kai+Luka minutes much more effective on offense, taking the THJ role
2. When all three are on the court, the spacing is likely to be absolutely exceptional
3. This is because Klay took 87% of his 3s from above the break, and hit tightly contested (defender 2-4 feet away) 3s at a ridiculous 40% last year. The Mavs hit an above-average 32% on such shots, but Klay will likely be their best shooter in this regard.
4. Klay remains one of the very best shooters in the game when it comes to his above the break 3P% and contested 3P%; many/most of the statistically best 3P shooters in the game are worse in both of these categories compared to him.
5. Klay's overall mix of 3P shots on the Warriors last year was significantly harder than the typical shot from the statistically best players in the league, and he will very likely benefit from being the #3 scoring consideration on a team vs. the #2.
6. A large portion of Klay's value will come from him taking on the THJ role/shots, and his numbers last year were better than anything THJ ever provided during his time in Dallas. It is these minutes that are likely to make Klay a significant positive to overall team performance.
7. His defense is no longer a positive, but is probably overblown as a concern overall, and certainly overblown when you factor in his ability to hit tough shots. The Mavs have Marshall and Grimes available to play plus defense at the end of the game if Klay's tough shot ability is not what is needed. His defensive limitations were easier to exploit in the Warriors' undersized lineup than likely will be the case in Dallas.",Mavericks,63,https://www.reddit.com/r/Mavericks/comments/1dt936e/if_klay_performs_at_the_same_level_as_last_year/

2024-07-07,1720351565,TIL Klay Thompson and Paul George are the same age (long rant in comments),"Both Klay and PG are 34. 

One got a 4 year max $212 million and the other got a 3 year $50 million. 

Those are the facts. 

Stop reading here if you just wanted the TIL but keep reading if you want to hear the ramblings of a 15+ year Mavs fan. 

Now you might say Klay didnt play for 2 years with the ACL and Achilles injuries so the price has injuries factored in. In the last three seasons after recovering, Klay has averaged about 59 games while PG averaged 53. Many of us forget before the injuries, Klay was seen as one of the NBA best iron mans, consistently playing 70-80 games per regular season. 

To be fair, PG is a better defender and rebounder at this stage in his career than Klay. Is that really worth a $36 million dollar per year difference? Especially when Klays shooting efficiency far exceeds PGs. While the Sixers have turned into a legitimate big 3, no one is talking about the Mavs having a real big 3 potentially due to how Klays departure went in GS. 

Why is this important?

EVERYONE IS STILL UNDERRATING THE DALLAS MAVERICKS. 

Go look at any next season rankings. Many have the Celtics,Thunder, Wolves, Knicks, possibly Nuggets all ranked higher than the Mavs. 

This is absurd. A team that was JUST in the Finals with their superstar not at 100% and added not only one of the best shooters in the league but one of the best shooters OF ALL TIME to replace a vet min wing who over performed for us (we still love you DJJ,) should EASILY be a title favorite. But according to betting odds, the Mavs title odds didnt change AT ALL after landing Klay. 

We, as Mavs fans have always known that the franchise has been criminally underrated, keeping us from signing many free agents in the past. Now that Klay has also become underrated as well, there is now a massive discrepancy in how the Mavs are seen as well. 

Critics say the Mavs defense will take a step back this year since we lost DJJ. As much as we all love DJJ, when has losing a vet min player ever been that impactful for a championship caliber team? I, for one, am personally excited to see a non vet min player (Naji Marshall) perform in DJJs role and given Kidd and Sweeneys resume, I think they will be able to get the  most out of this defense. 

Side note: the Mavs usually play their best defense after scoring on a possession so imo adding Klays shooting will really help energize Luka on defense. 

After the Celtics won, we have seen the blueprint for modern championship teams: having an extremely deep roster to surround your two stars. This is now what Nico Harrison has built. Kyrie and Luka are now surrounded by Klay, PJ, DLive, Gafford, Grimes, Marshall, Hardy, Maxi, Exum. A roster that is legitimately 10-11 players deep. 

To quote one of my favorite movies Moneyball: People are overlooked for a variety of biased reasons and perceived flaws. Age, appearance, personality. Nico Harrison and mathematics cuts straight through all of that.

All joking aside, Nico has built this roster in a way I didnt even think possible. The Mavs should be title favorites with the Celtics and have the best big 3 in the league hands down. 

I am so excited for next season and all Mavs fans should be as well. This is the best roster the Mavs have ever had in their entire franchise history and I dont think its particularly close. 

/rant

tl;dr Take all of your money and put it on the Mavs winning the championship this year and Luka winning MVP

2024-04-09,1712683907,Who has to step up for the Mavs to win the chip?,"The team looks awesome right now (top 5 baby!), but we've had LuKai operating at their best and role players stepping up when we needed them. I think most of us would agree that there's a path to the championship, but what needs to happen and who needs to step up?

Luka: Our boy has historically been a menace in the playoffs. As long as he's healthy and going strong, we will always have a chance.

Kyrie: This year has been one of his healthiest seasons in the league. Can he stay that way through the playoffs? When LuKai both give us 20+ points, we are usually in a winning position.

Kidd: This is his year to prove himself as a coach. Our outcome this year will likely label 2022 as a fluke forever, or Kidd will earn everyone's respect officially. He seems to be focused on culture and trust, and it looks good right now. But when we lose and he's trusting the guys that make us lose, it looks bad.

Lively and Gafford: These guys are possibly our biggest X factor this year. They've blown away expectations this season, but can they hold up against big men on the biggest stage? Can they keep get momentum swinging buckets against playoff competitors? Should we be worried about Lively's injury outlook?

THJ: Love him or hate him, he's still a big factor in our success and I think that's why Kidd and the team seemed okay losing a few games to try and get him hot for the end of the season. We're lucky, though, because Exum and some of these other guys are proving to be better than we expected, which is taking some pressure of Tim and allowing him to find a new role. Before, we lived and died by his 3s. Now he can stop shooting and we still can win. But, if he's shooting well, we almost always win. So let's hope he gets hot.

PJ: If this guy can limit the scoring of other stars through the playoffs, his role will already be huge. If he can efficiently score 20-30 points regularly, I don't know who can stop us.

Exum: Love this guy's story this season. If he can stay healthy he could be a highlight of our post season. Hopefully his 3s keep falling.

DJJ: I'll admit I'm not super familiar with his role right now. He seems to be a solid all around role player. Does he have a next level? What are we hoping for from him?

Green and Hardy: These are young guys that show sparks, but also can be pretty quiet. If one of these guys takes a leap in the playoffs, I don't know if opposing teams will have a good game plan against us. However, I think the expectation is for them play their role solidly.

Dwight and Maxi: If we're lucky, these guys don't get too much play time. I think Kidd still wants Maxi to have a role, but hopefully he'll make him earn it for playoff minutes. But he had some huge moments in the 2022 run. If he can hit some clutch 3s, he could still be a decent piece.

Obviously this is all a bit premature and we still need to finish the season. I think, and hope, that the team is focused on the upcoming games and securing a 5th or 6th seed, but as a fan I'm just curious what our distant forecast really looks like in such a competitive conference. It increasingly looks like we will get the Clippers in round 1. Who needs to step up in that matchup? What needs to happen if we end up facing what seems to be our scariest matchups in Denver or Boston?

Awesome night.  Keep celebrating.  Dare I say the vibes are immaculate.  Etc.  Just one quick thing...

The Thunder did not help us get Lively.  I'm seeing this over and over commented in Mavs threads and threads on r/nba and it's a silly thing but it's driving me crazy.

We had 10, Orland had 11, OKC had 12.  We were taking Lively at 10 with or without the Thunder.  The Thunder wanted Cason Wallace but were worried he wouldn't get past Orlando at 11 since they were definitely targeting a guard; therefore, we traded BACK two spots with OKC.  In exchange for us moving back, OCK took on the Bertans contract, which opened up the trade exception Nico would use later in the night to take on Holmes's money and the pick that became OMax from Sac.  

We helped OKC Get Wallace. They helped us dump Bertans (and in that way they helped us get OMax)...but they did not help us get Lively.  We were going to just take him at 10.  With this trade, we got to get off of a bad contract, get flexibility for future moves, and STILL get the guy we were already getting anyway.

Small thing...but it's just been really killing me seeing it commented over and over.

2024-06-03,1717373818,How many here became fans because of Luka? ,"Ill cap this off by saying I live in Missouri, so I never had a big home team to root for. A lot of people around the area were Thunder fans, but eh I could never really get behind Westbrook. I wasnt a fan of his game. So Ive always tended to follow players more than teams. I know thats kinda frowned upon by many, but its just how it is for me I cant change how I feel. Being a fan is all about passion, cant always force it. Not the case as an nfl fan, Im a packers diehard through and through since birth (family ties to team). 

But like as a fan who doesnt have a team to follow consistently, the nba was just super boring in that mid-late 2010s era. The playoffs were cool an all (2016 was obviously awesome), but I couldnt make myself watch a regular season game. But I kept hearing about this kid in Europe who is killing grown adults, watched highlights and I just knew hed be good. Kept my eye on him as a rookie and by year 2 I was fully on the bandwagon. Not even cause hes amazing, but no one else makes basketball this fun to watch, at least in my opinion. 

Cant say the team hasnt rubbed off on me, lively is EASILY my second favorite player. I truly think he could be a hall of hamer, if hes playing with Luka he honestly has a solid chance. His playmaking is going to be phenomenal in 2 years. He will learn from guys like Luka, kyrie, Kidd, Chandler, dirk. Hes got so many amazing people to learn from. Hes setup to be a big problem in the future. 

Anyways, just curious how many here have a similar story. Mavs seem to have a lot of faithful diehards cause of dirk, so Im just wondering. ",Mavericks,185,https://www.reddit.com/r/Mavericks/comments/1d6rhtb/how_many_here_became_fans_because_of_luka/
2024-05-16,1715881970,I love how NO ONE in the media or other forums are talking about what we are doing to the #1 team in the West,"First of all, this series SHOULD be over had we not squandered the last 6 minutes of game 4. Can you imagine the #1 team in the West, ousted in 5 games of the second round? Hopefully we only have to wait until Saturday to do that. 

Luka is held together with spit, glue, athletic tape and leggings and still dropped a 31pt triple double masterpiece last night. Kyrie hasn't had his Kyrie game...yet. Maxi is out and the best team in the West is being handled.

Our defense gets better and better throughout series. It did last round against the Clippers too. 

OKC was one of the top offensive teams this season and we are taking it to them and shutting them down pretty nicely.

3rd in Scoring Per Game at 120.1  - We have held them to 117,110,101,100 &amp; 92.

3rd in FG % at 49.9 - We have held them to 45%,47%,47%,38% &amp; 42%.

13.3 3PM per and lead the league at 38.9% - We have held them to 34%,33%,33%,26% &amp; 25%.

Its not like the Mavericks offensively are just overwhelming them and everyone is shooting lights out either. And Luka and Kyrie have been, for their standards, relatively quiet this series. And we have been really sloppy with the ball and turning it over. And yet we are still up 3-2.

We have taken advantage of matchups, size and athleticism. Gafford and Lively keep OKC on their toes in the paint and on the Lob. DJJ and PJ are absolutely killing it. 

After game one we have been the better team for the last 4 games. Lets continue that on Saturday and put the nail in the coffin. LFG!",Mavericks,79,https://www.reddit.com/r/Mavericks/comments/1ctj1ys/i_love_how_no_one_in_the_media_or_other_forums/

Who knows the next time they will make it? They are in it right now! The next time someone asks when the Mavericks made the Finals we can tell them 2024 rather than 2011.

There are so many things that came out of this year that we can enjoy. The arrival of Dereck Lively. The acquisitions of PJ and Gafford. The Clippers/Thunder/Timberwolves series.

We are still in this! Im very grateful for this team and what theyve accomplished this year. Redditors/the media/the annoying person at work will always have something to say.

He's gotta fill in the minutes that are normally given to THJ, and maybe take the role that Exum was supposed to be for us in terms of adding another ball handler and playmaker. I like Exum, but it seems like the bright lights are having a definite effect on him.

Hardy wasn't that efficient with his shot against OKC but I think that won't last long. He's a decent 3PT shooter, but his playmaking ability showed flashes when he was in the game. But most importantly, he didn't look overwhelmed by the moment, and still played his game and was able to give us good minutes when Kyrie or Luka were out.

It's an exceptional thing for the team you cheer for to get to the Finals. Let alone get to WCF and NBA Finals within just three years. We have what appears to be a perennial contender and dear God does that feel good. 

I believe in this team this year. I'm cautiously optimistic and I think they are fairly considered the underdog but I believe they can win it all. That's a great feeling. 

To the younger guys that are commenting on other subreddits and reposting stuff from r/Celtics, that ain't it (same goes to the Celtics people reading this on our sub).

2024-05-16,1715833298,Hardy should get THJs minutes now,"At this point Ive seen all that i can handle &amp; Im sure i cant be the only one&THJ is just too much of a liability in these close games, he had two shots in a row that didnt even get CLOSE (one quite literally hit the top of the backboard surprised refs didnt call it out of bounds, to then get the rebound to jack up another brick). 

Side note: I was ECSTATIC to see the boy Hardy finally get some quality minutes, maybe he didnt flash too much but i think he was just trying to make the right play, not make mistakes. I think thats great. 

VS

THJ who when we were up 16? 18? Single handed 3 possessions in a row does THJ things which led them to have a run to almost, thanks to the ice cold shooting of Pj kept the lead at bay. Like COMON bro, enough is enough. He needs to be pushed. I believe Kidd will actually start to trust him more. 

Anyway that was my major takeaway from the game. Our boys played like gladiators tonight &amp; we didnt even flinch in that environment.

2024-07-09,1720512079,Lets revisit some absurd Luka passes from Game 2& except with Klay Thompson on the floor instead ,"This will be long just FYI. I believe someone made a video on YT splicing Klay shots after a Luka pass, but Im not that talented and think theres actually much bigger ramifications Klays mere presence will have on defenses beyond wow having the second greatest shooter ever taking those 3s should be fun. I mean yes, obviously thats a pretty neat option but these 6 plays from game 2 would be fundamentally different (probably to the extent they never happen) because of Klays pure gravity.\
\
1. **Luka-Maxi high ball screen, Kleber pops, great look just missed it. Live with that shot every single time.** But imagine Klay is in the strong corner and Ky is on the wing, now what? First, before the play is even initiated I guarantee you White (Im gonna leave BOS defenders as is for simplicity even though Jrue/White likely swap places) aint sitting top of the key off Ky. So just putting Klay on the floor has already eliminated the triple team lol that Luka ultimately receives. Now he can attack KP hard with no nail help from White, and Jrue or Tatum have a decisionwe helping off Klay or Lively? **OR** lets presume thats Naji popping, Luka engages KP, makes same pass, and its a wide open look or more likely Naji putting that shit on the floor and stuffing it on Tatums head or dropping it off for an easy Lively slam. **OR** what if we use Klays strengths now? He starts in the weak corner (again Whites gotta go too) and when Luka initiates the high screen, Klay runs baseline off a Lively pin down to the SSC, or receives a second stagger screen from Ky and flashes to the wingeveryone ends up in the *exact* same spots but instead of BOS sending 3 to Luka and playing 2v4 they have to deal with multiple switches off-ball before actually trying to defend a Mavs stock PnR look.\
\
2. **Luka trapped, insane pass to PJ, just missed it. Live with that shot every time.** But imagine just Klay out there while Ky gets a blow and its Hardy/Exum/Grimes/whoever for Josh. Again, youve probably eliminated that trap on Luka. But now you simply slide PJ to the corner and Klay on the wing. Either of those is a far better look than PJ above the break. Theres plenty of other things you could do but since the trap likely doesnt come its irrelevant.\
\
3. **Luka drives, kicks to Green, best corner look all series just missed it. Live with that shot every time.** But imagine Klay is in that SSCyou can be damn sure Jrue aint the one helping off now. Which opens up endless possibilities but the important thing is everything changes based solely on a different guy standing in the same spot.\
\
4/5. **Luka blitzed, finds open shooter. More A+ looks.** The key thing on these is reiterating the dilemma teams will have deciding to send multiple guys at Luka with Klay one pass away. But I think what could be *very fascinating* is how you wanna guard Klay setting the screen? You can ignore DJJ popping top of the keywouldnt recommend it with Klay. You can trap and rotate to Klay but thats perfect. The issue DAL had vs BOS wasnt just missing shots, it was the complete inability to get them in rotation. When you have to actually guard 5 guys thats a bit harder to pull off.\
\
6. **Luka silly pass to Exum, play reset.** The intriguing part of this play (besides with Klay that bitch going up lol) is despite the Mavs accidentally running some off-ball motion action and they ended up wide open which they somehow never thought to try intentionally, but I digress. Klay is literally the best at that in basketball history so I thought that was a good example how even the simplest movement when its Klay Thompson moving also opens up endless possibilities. And none of the things Ive mentioned require the Mavs to change their offense (although I think and hope they will at least a bit).",Mavericks,121,https://www.reddit.com/r/Mavericks/comments/1dyww63/lets_revisit_some_absurd_luka_passes_from_game_2/

Thats not what Thunder, who I believe are a fraud 1 seed, were doing.

Dort was playing an entirely different sport, he should try out for freestyle wrestling

Shai for the second game in a row was throwing elbows at DJJ

Chet shoves guys in the back then somehow he gets rewarded for it with a foul 


In all honesty it makes for a terrible viewing experience when you are wondering if they are going to Injure Luka, DJJ or anyone else 

Hope the league sorts it out otherwise someone WILL get injured.

Why are Lukas shortcomings the only ones mentioned? As if hes the only superstar who isnt elite at literally every aspect of basketball or complains at refs. 

I swear they put Luka in SGA and Tatum talks for so long all season to diminish his accomplishments that they actually raised the ranking of those two second tier super stars. You mean to tell me SGA is so much better at defense than Luka that he not only ranks above him in the MVP voting, but also above 2x DPOY Giannis? When will SGA ever win DPOY? What does he do better than Giannis aside from being an average low volume 3pt shooter. Hes not even the best defender on his team. 


Jokic is having an average season by his standards.

2023-11-16,1700147674,Just to reiterate that the Mavs FO did an amazing job this offseason,"I was so fucking desperate for a center this offseason that I was begging for them to just take Lively at 10 and call it a day. We all know now the Mavs have this tendency to get cute with their moves instead of just taking the carrot in front of their faces, and there were rumors floating around that they would trade the pick *just* to dump salary, or for some old over the hill vet.

Well hey, Nico really pulled out a masterclass and showed why he's GM and we're not. He shed Bertans' salary, got Dereck and OMax out of the draft, traded peanuts for Grant, re-signed Curry for a bag of Doritos, then reached into the darkness like the hand of God and plucked Exum and DJJ out of the void.

Because that's why they won, crazy shot after crazy shot. That's it. Just like game 1, which albeit had a little more to do with poor rotations in the first half. 

You're just emotional, mainly because we came back from down 31, if we hadn't have retaken the lead, and lost by 12 again, the temperament would be that the Clippers just shot the lights out. Which is the only way they have been in the series. Anytime they shoot average, we have dominated them.

Again, in case you didn't actually watch the game, the Clippers won because they made 60% of their 3s and most of them were contested.

Man I really hope he is back next game. Dwight Powell looked like a headless chicken and Maxi looked bit rusty as well.

Also, we cannot just play Gafford 40 minutes, and Lively has looked better than him.

Neck strain could be tricky but I think he should still be fairly effective.

Same injury would be way worse for our playmakers like Luka, since they have to move their neck all the time to scan for open players.

The crazy thing is this team still has some assets to work with to make additional moves this off-season. On top of that, this team is very young and should be even better next year. Outside of maxi and thj, every player (that gets actual minutes) is either in their prime or yet to enter their prime.

Our young core is showing tons of potential as well. Lively, Green, and hardy are all 23 or younger. Omax made tremendous progress in the g league and is looking anunoby-esque. Luka, pj, and gafford are only 25, which means we most likely haven't seen their best play yet.

# Mavs Dereck Lively IIs bond with second graders in Grapevine-Colleyville

A chance meeting with the mother of the Dallas Mavericks rookie connected an elementary teacher with the NBA star.

[Dallas Mavericks rookie star Dereck Lively II \(center\) poses with Grapevine-Colleyville ISD teacher Brittany Cohen \(right\) and her most recent class of second graders. At a December game, Cohen met Lively's late mother and told her about her class' love for the player. Soon after, the Mavericks NBA All-Rookie second-teamer surprised the class with a video  spurring a close bond between him and the second graders.\(Brittany Cohen\)](https://preview.redd.it/bzir39rm4t6d1.jpg?width=919&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=cf360897d4fc0e5491e71ada75f64118658bbc74)

Second grade teacher Brittany Cohen has been a Dallas Mavericks fan since she moved to Texas as a teenager.

So in her classroom at Glenhope Elementary in Colleyville, Cohen incorporates what she coined Mavs Math to make numbers fun for her students by having them track scores and team stats. Her reputation as the Mavs teacher quickly spread across the school  and caught the attention of Mavericks center Dereck Lively II, the teams rookie star.

***They know I love them. They know that for sure***, Lively said of the class at a recent news conference.

Over the past few years, Cohens students have graphed how many points Mavericks point guard Luka Doncic scored per game, compared their height to that of former center Boban Marjanovic and collected data on how many dunks Lively made in a season.

While watching a preseason game at lunchtime, her recent class of 18 students became enchanted by Lively. His game highlights became a staple at morning class meetings, with the 7- and 8-year-olds discussing his performance and watching clips.

Hes young, and hes 7-foot-1. And he makes these cool dunks, so they just fell in love with him immediately, Cohen said. They just went crazy for him.

Her students from the Grapevine-Colleyville ISD school even wrote him letters saying that he inspired them.

\[Youre\] pretty much my favorite player on the Mavs, Pierce Austin, 8, wrote in a November letter.

Then during a December game, the educator, who is a season ticket holder, met Livelys late mother, Kathy Drysdale. Cohen gushed over how much her kids love him. Hes been a huge inspiration to them, she recalled.

It meant a lot to her that he had already made an impact on another generation, Cohen said. You could tell that she was so proud of him.

Later that month, the Mavericks NBA All-Rookie second-teamer surprised the class with a video.

Thank you guys for being able to just show all your love and support for me on the basketball court, Lively said. It is so inspiring. Being able to know that you guys are watching me, it just makes it that much more fun.

It was the start of a close relationship between Lively and the class, which attended a game in February. The students sat on the court during warm-ups, talked to Lively, got autographs and met other players. Cohen, unfortunately, was unable to go because she was traveling for her daughters birthday.

Lively said at the recent news conference that he wanted to make a positive impact on the students lives and to be able to make sure that, no matter if youre 5 years old, 10 years old, 15 years old, whatever you want to do, whatever you want to be, do your best to do it.

Cameron Cloud, 8, was in disbelief after meeting the basketball star.

I was like, How did I get to meet him? Oh my gosh. Mrs. Cohen, how are you doing all this stuff for me? he said.

Cameron, who plays basketball, baseball and football and aspires to become a professional athlete, hopes to similarly inspire others when hes older.

I get to meet some fans and like, I can say hi to them, like Dereck Lively did to me, he said.

Class parents also followed Livelys year, recognizing that he was going through so much  including his mothers illness and her death in April, playoffs pressure and his own injuries.

But still, he made these kiddos a priority & \[It\] speaks volumes of his character, said Britney Cloud, Camerons mom.

Cohen said her students feel important because of the time Lively spent with them, so they wanted to pay it forward.

After brainstorming in class, they decided to set up a lemonade stand at their school in early April to raise money for UT Southwestern Medical Centers cancer center in his name. Livelys mother had been battling cancer since 2013.

The children hoped he would stop by, but Cohen managed their expectations. Hes an NBA player, she reminded them. It doesnt mean that he doesnt care. It just means that hes busy.

Little did they know, the player had messaged their teacher that he was rushing over to Colleyville to surprise the kids, who exploded in shrieks and jumped up in excitement when he arrived.

Whenever were young, we have many dreams. We have many aspirations, and when we grow up, we lose those, Lively said at the news conference. We lose sight of who we wanted to be, what dreams we had as a kid, and I feel like we should never lose those things.

About a week after the lemonade stand, Livelys mother died. She had spent more than a decade battling Hodgkins lymphoma, a kind of cancer that develops in the lymph system.

To make time for a bunch of kids that he doesnt even really know when hes going through something so terrible in his personal life, says so much about him, Cohen said. Hes so special. Hes changed our kids lives.

First 7 games of the playoffs (compared to regular season): FG: 39.5% (-9.2), 3P: 22.7% (-15.5), EFG: 44.5% (-12.9), TS%: 50.2% (-11.5). 4-3 record.

Luka had a really poor early stretch of games but he is back to playing as efficiently as ever to help us win all the games in the second round. Conflating that stretch with his current form in not logical imo. 

Yes, he is shooting about 25% less but that makes perfect sense in a set of 5 games where PJ Washington averaged 25.3 over 3 games and DJJ averaged 19.3 over 3 games at game breaking efficiency. It would be absurd for Luka to prioritise his scoring when multiple role players are hotter than the sun.

2024-07-20,1721514887,Klay Thompson ranked 2nd Overall in the NBA on Off-Ball gravity this season [Krishna Narsu],"Explanation of the metric 
OFF-BALL GRAVITY
This metric aims to measure how much attention and resources a team uses trying to defend a player when they don't have the ball. Players that are stronger 3-point shooters will do better in this metric, and if players are able to shoot off movement and utilize off-ball screens to generate 3-point attempts they'll tend to grade out higher in this metric.

The way the data is gathered: The way it works is it looks at different coverages (do you get blitzed, do defenders go over/under etc.) and regresses that against ORAPM. So the scale is similar to impact metrics (per 100 possessions).

Klay on the floor will give insane spacing to Luka and Kyrie. This was a big hole of ours too we had nobody to create spacing. Like how much better filling in the holes we had at backup c and PF.

2024-06-07,1717772731,Honestly how can we be successful on D against them ? ,"They have an 8 man rotation and they are all great shooters and good defenders(except Horford). They play a 5 out that is supported by all 8 of them. Usually these teams play with a small ball center so you beat them with paint points. But their starter center is a 7.3 rim protector that moves almost like a guard and takes threes from 30 ft. 
 
I'm not too pessimistic because Kidd has consistently good adjustments after losses in Game 1. But even if we click offensively I honestly don't know how we can stop them. Offensively though our team looked afraid. Only Luka and Pj looked comfortable taking shots. You can't pass up on good shots. If you miss them you miss them, but at least it shows nerve and good decisions. I'm trying not to overreact because it's the first serious playoff run for all of them so it's natural, but we have to be more comfortable shooting if we want to have any chance. 

Also why were we consistently challenging Porzingis and Brown in drives. Instead of playing patiently we took bad layups/dunk attempts that were either blocked or bad looks. 

Edit: Because many people commented it. I don't consider him a bad defender, I just think he's decent. No more than that. Could be wrong though. 

Edit 2: I get I was wrong about Horford defensively (though it was kinda overblown, I said he was decent , not that he was bad). The exception part went only to his defence, offensively I know he can drop 25 any day.

2024-05-31,1717173136,Luka and his Lobgoblins have weaponized the alley-oop like no one else," I nearly fell off my couch when a graphic popped up in the Game 3 broadcast of the Western Conference Finals stating that the Dallas Mavericks had five time as many alley-oop dunks in the playoffs as second-place Denver. Even accounting for the extra games Dallas has played, thats outrageous. I had to know more. So I dusted off my Excel skills, got out my data-shovel, and did some digging.

The oop is a curious thing; it has that oh-so-rare combination of efficiency and beauty. (Its hard to know exactly *how* efficient, given that a missed oop can be categorized a number of different ways, but lobs still convert far more often than they dont). There have never been more alley-oops in the league than in this era. Passing skill has never been higher, and spacing for rim-runs has never been more prominent.

But lobs still occur less frequently than you might think. Per my data, Dallas tied with Utah (!) for 121 made alley-oop dunks in the regular season, the most in the league. Thats 1.5 per game. Atlanta (102), led by talented lob-thrower Trae Young, is the only other team that even cracked 100.

*\[Thanks for reading! This was originally intended for a more general NBA audience, so please apologize for some of the ""no duh"" stuff in here for Mavs fans. As always,* [*I've collected a bunch of illustrative video clips that can be found here*](https://www.basketballpoetry.com/p/luka-doncic-and-the-lobgoblins) *or linked throughout the article.\]*

If we narrow it down to just the 30 games starting Feb 10th, the first game after the trade for Daniel Gafford, the Mavs led the league by a mile. They tabulated 61 alley-oop slams compared to just 39 by the second-place Golden State Warriors over that stretch, or two per game. In the playoffs, though, against multiple talented defenses locked in on the lob, that pace would be harder to maintain, right?

Hilariously wrong.

Smash-cut to the Western Conference Finals, where the Mavs converted on 16 made alley-oop dunks (compared to two for Minnesota, both KAT-to-Gobert connections). 16 divided by five (\*whips out abacus, moves some beads\*)& thats more than three per game!

If you need one play that symbolizes the entire Western Conference Finals, its this from Game 2. Mike Conley misses Rudy Gobert on an alley-oop, the ball slams off the backboard and ignites a Mavericks fast break, and uberstar Luka Doncic finds Dereck Lively for a far more successful lob attempt: \[[video here](https://www.basketballpoetry.com/p/luka-doncic-and-the-lobgoblins)\]

In total, the Mavs have 54 total playoff alley-oop slams in 17 games. Second-place Denver totaled *nine* in nine games; Minnesota only accumulated six in three rounds (their collective inability to find Gobert on lobs is criminal).

Some fans have taken to calling this group the Lobgoblins (get it? Like hobgoblins?), which I love. The squads earned it. This is a weapon unique to the Dallas Mavericks.

Heres how Dallas lobs look distributed by passer and finisher: \[[fun graph here](https://www.basketballpoetry.com/p/luka-doncic-and-the-lobgoblins)\]

Hilariously, all of Lively (22), Gafford (17), and Derrick Jones (10) have finished more alley-oop dunks than any other *team* in these playoffs. Theyre even throwing lobs to each other: \[[video here](https://www.basketballpoetry.com/p/luka-doncic-and-the-lobgoblins)\]

(By the way, someone should lob all involved Mavericks leadership in jail for not getting Doncic a center who can jump over a phonebook before this season. Its long been a common complaint among the Mavs faithful, but Im still so retroactively angry on his behalf.)

How has Dallas upped their oops? The playoffs strip the fat from an offense. Starters play more minutes, and coaches dont mess around. They go for the optimal offensive play every time, and if you have the personnel for it, *nothing* is a better play than presenting a lob to a dunker-to-be. So Mavs coach Jason Kidd and superstar Luka Doncic have designed a playoff offense largely around the alley-oop.

It starts with the personnel, of course. Kyrie Irving isnt on Doncics level as a passer, but he can get into the lane at will, with or without a pick. Hes more than good enough to launch a perfect oop even after losing his dribble on the way up: \[[video here](https://www.basketballpoetry.com/p/luka-doncic-and-the-lobgoblins)\]

Doncic is on the short list of greatest lob-throwers in the game. He has the size, passing skill, vision, and creativity to find vertical passing lanes in places the mortal basketball mind cant comprehend. Here, he sees DJJ streaking to the hoop and launches this pass while Jones is still *behind the three-point line*: \[[video here](https://www.basketballpoetry.com/p/luka-doncic-and-the-lobgoblins)\]

Jones is nicknamed Airplane Mode for a reason, and yet he is just the third-most important dunker on the team (and, curiously, only Luka has found him for a lob in these 17 games). The Mavs two-headed dunking hydra, Dereck Lively and Daniel Gafford, provides Doncic with the perfect center pairing. Both have large catch radiuses and can go up and get a lob even at a standstill. The rookie Lively, in particular, has become elite at high-pointing a ball and slamming it through the cylinder even in a rush-hour traffic jam.

Of course, its not just about the lob. The *threat* of the alley-oop is what opens up the entire offense, and defenses havent been able to adjust. Theyre playing whack-a-mole: tag the rolling rim-runners aggressively to take away the lob, and an easy kick out for a three appears. Stay home on everyone, and ballhandlers stroll to the rack.

Minnesota should have been able to slow the Mavs. The leagues best defense stifled Denver, preventing them from getting to their spots and largely relegating them to the perimeter (see Nikola Jokics three-point attempt numbers). But Doncic and Irving had few problems against Minnesotas perimeter stoppers, using screen after hand-off after screen to get a foot into the paint. Once they pass the first line of defense, no center has a chance. Stepping up a tiny bit too high opens up the lob lanes. Dropping too much concedes the floater, and Doncic and Irving are *buoyant:* \[[video here\]](https://www.basketballpoetry.com/p/luka-doncic-and-the-lobgoblins)

Heck, sometimes they dont even need a floater. Sometimes, the threat of the lob opens up uncontested layups. Look how reluctant Gobert (the best in the world at this particular aspect of defense, by the way) is to leave Gafford alone in the dunker spot: \[[video here](https://www.basketballpoetry.com/p/luka-doncic-and-the-lobgoblins)\]

Teams have tried helping harder off the corners than Minnesota generally did, but Jones ([46% on corner threes](https://cleaningtheglass.com/stats/player/1934#tab-shooting_accuracy)) and PJ Washington (41%) have hit every important shot during this playoff run. Here, the Thunder do a good job stopping Irving and crowding Lively on the catch, preventing the oop, but Washington still buries the triple: \[[video here](https://www.basketballpoetry.com/p/luka-doncic-and-the-lobgoblins)\]

Defenses have to live and die with that shot, in my opinion, since expecting point-of-attack defenders to stymie Doncic and Irving consistently is asking too much. Some of the meanest, stickiest dudes in the league have had issues recovering onto Doncic, especially, and if youre on his back, youre at his mercy. Even when defenses *do* contain Doncic at the point of attack, he draws so much attention that cracks open up in unexpected places: \[[video here](https://www.basketballpoetry.com/p/luka-doncic-and-the-lobgoblins)\]

Thats too damn sexy.

There are as many reasons to enjoy basketball as people who watch it, but *everyone* enjoys seeing a good alley-oop. Thankfully, Luka and his marauding band of Lobgoblins have transformed it from an occasional highlight into a core concept of their offense.

2024-05-28,1716908132,The unheralded MVP of this series? It's PJ Washington.,"There is no question we are witnessing one of the greatest offensive duos ever performing at peak powers and dominating in the clutch. Anyone watching this series would primarily credit those two for the Mavs unbelievable success. Our alley oops are on track to be a playoff record too.

But there is one player who has not gotten enough love amidst all the highlight reel dunks and clutch game winners: PJ Washington.

According to his [head-to-head tracking stats](https://www.nba.com/stats/player/1629023/head-to-head) he has spent more minutes guarding KAT in three games than any other player this playoffs (26:45 through the first three games.)

KAT is shooting 28.6% FG% and 9.1% 3P% with PJ as his primary defender, Currently he has the ignominy of being the worst true shooting percentage in conference finals history in the 3-point era with &gt; 50 shot attempts.

While a lot of that is Towns' own shortcomings, PJ's disruptive defense has been stifling and prevented him from having a shot to break out of his slump. And Towns's massive underperformance and wasted possessions is easily the difference maker in a series that had three relatively close games where the Mavs were trailing at some point and won in the clutch.

Coming in, many of us were concerned that we didn't have anyone to stop Towns without Kleber but PJ has blown past any expectations and turned KAT into a scrub. If you watch the [KAT lowlight videos](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YL0jiT_0p5k) you see how PJ and our centers are pressuring him and contesting every shot, and how PJ funnels any attempts to drive right into our center to help. Washington isn't allowing him to get started or find any rhythm at all offensively.",Mavericks,37,https://www.reddit.com/r/Mavericks/comments/1d2lg1l/the_unheralded_mvp_of_this_series_its_pj/
2024-07-07,1720349202,Nico. F*cking. Harrison. ,"I know we give him a lot of love as is in this sub but letting it all sink in with how hes completely revamped the roster over the course of just 3 years really puts it all into perspective. If you had told me in 2021 that by 2024;


- the Mavs would have a Finals and a WCF appearance

- their lineup would include Kyrie Irving, Klay Thompson, PJ Washington, and somehow still Dwight Powell

- A player on their roster in 20-21 would be named Head Coach of the Lakers 


I wouldve asked you to put down the pipe, and yet, over the course of 3 years Nico has leveraged a 19 year career at Nike working with players that included calling Steph Curry Seth in the pitch meeting that made him change to Under Armor and turned a roster that actually let Nicolò Melli and Boban get playing time into a 2-3 year championship window, solid younger players on Lukas timeline to continue to contend when the older players dont fit anymore, and a roster that was only thwarted by a stacked Boston team coached by some unholy combination of Ron Swanson and Rain Man.

1. They took Bertans off our hands because they are bros.  They took that albatross of a contract off our hands so we could get Omax Prosper and we still were able to pick Lively.  This is a NoHo Hank level bro move by an ""adversary"".
2. They gave us a free 2024 first round draft pick for entering into a pick swap agreement for 2028.  We used that pick (and the junk left over from the above mentioned Omax deal) to get Daniel Gafford.  OKC literally gave us the draft pick to go get Gafford.  OKC GAVE US THE DRAFT PICK TO GO GET GAFFORD.  We should probably go get them a cake or something.
3. They fleeced the Clippers for Paul George, making them the old slow team that the Mavs dismantled.  OKC has been looking out for the Mavs for years!  They didn't want us to have to play against Kawahi and Shae.  Super hommies.

It's going to hurt a little to have to take down such a nice franchise that has helped us out so, so very much.

2024-06-28,1719589811,Goodbye Tim,"During the KP era , I believed he was the best player we got use out of in the trade. I really thought he couldve made a difference against the Warriors in 22 if he had been healthy.at the beginning of the season, I was first worried when he found out he was coming off the bench, but for the beginning of the season I saw he took it as a challenge he was performing as 6MOTY candidate. I truly believe there is a great handful of games we would have lost without him at the beginning of the season.

 Im not sure what had happened with his performance but as time went on I just became more upset. I just wished things happened differently. I want any player on our team to perform well and I will always root for them. 

Im happy for the trade because hopefully he can find what is wrong and fix it. Im happy for us because when it comes to me cringing when a player starts to attack and then out of the norm he makes a great read leading to an assist (cant remember the exact play but it was a big nail biter, because it was close and we all just expected he was going to shoot/drive and lose the ball). My heart just cant take it. 

Also will never forget when he called safe instead of closing out.

2024-05-19,1716133545,Jason Kidd just became the 1st coach in Mavericks history to coach the team to 2 conference finals.,"Give this man some damn credit right now. He just achieved something never done in Mavericks history in only his 3rd season as head coach. Not Rick, not Don Nelson, nobody.

Dereck Lively is not having the game he had yesterday without the coaching he has received all season from Kidd and staff (shoutout Tyson). Kidd showed faith in him and empowered him from day 1 while putting him in great positions to succeed. Credit to Dereck for the work he has put in and his mentality, but that kind of development doesn't happen in a vacuum. 

DJJ has been a total journeyman who has had a breakout season and was huge in game 6. Again Kidd and crew have empowered him and put him in positions to succeed in a way that previous teams could not.

This team has managed to completely gel with a huge mid-season shift in their roster. That is a credit to the coaching staff, that doesn't happen just magically. And it doesn't happen magically to get guys from losing situations and get them ready to play under the bright lights.

Finally, I don't think the Lukai chemistry would be this good without Kidd and his staff. They have enabled that duo and helped them find their rhythm together, something that did NOT seem inevitable at the end of last season. That is good coaching, and it's clear those two respect Kidd in a big way. 

Shoutout to Sean Sweeney too, my dude always flying under the radar but all of the above goes for him as well. I bet he gets a look at a HC job soon.

His percentage on wide open 3pt shots (+6 feet out) is a scorching 42%, and his percentage on open shots is 37%.

And just for the funsies, he is also improved as a FT shooter, going up from 74% last season to 78% right now, a whole whooping 4% improvement!

2024-05-14,1715716489,I believe in The Don. Am I the only one left? Mavs in 6. ,"Luka Doncic has done things at his age only MJ, LBJ, Wilt and the like have done. We have all witnessed him do things in the playoffs and regular season few men will ever touch. 

He is by no means perfect, but the fair weather fans calling him a lazy fat baby and all that bullshit need to get the fuck out of here. 

This is his first season with a proven #2 and championship level pieces around him. Despite a multitude of injuries, (since the end of the regular season) Luka has led us to a playoff series win and we are in a position to reach the WCF. Luka has one leg right now, no one can shoot without legs! 

Give this man some respect and a fucking break! This sub sounds like a bunch of ungrateful bastards, he aint Kawhi or AD. Hes the most injured hes ever been and fighting through like a motherfucker.  

Luka aint perfect, but if you dont think hes fighting his ass off right now nothing will ever seem like fight to you! Hes getting tripped, elbowed and thrown around for two series with already fucked legs. Hes had one bad playoff series ever!

Yes, Luka needs to control his temper better and grow as a leader and I 100% believe he will. This whole team needs to mature. We all saw last night. But have you not seen the leaps and bounds Lukas defense has grown in 2 years? We are only beginning to see what Luka can do. We are only beginning to see what this fantastic Mavs core can do.

If Luka was healthy playoff Luka right now wed be in the WCF in 5 games and probably cooked the Clips in 5 too. This is obvious to me whether we win this series or not. 

if we do lose, Im ready to run it back with the fucking dawgs we got on this team, the MF Don, and the third eye guru weve come to love so well! 

But as long as theres still a chance. ITS MAVS IN 6!! 

 I believe in the Mavs and I believe in Luka Doncic.

2024-05-20,1716213356,No Ones Picking Us,"Everyone watches this Minnesota team and sees the 92 Bulls. This league and its followers want the next face of the league/best player in the world to be an American so badly and I dont completely blame them for it, but that combined with the massive bias against Lukai that many fans have is distorting everyones perception of how this series is gonna go. 

It doesnt matter how well they defend if we can match that and get four good nights of offense. Mavs in 6.

Edit: I totally agree with yall that being an underdog has its perks, I just dont think were actually underdogs. Im totally cool with our squad being doubted and flying under the radar though, itll probably help. 

Edit #2: I am not on the team, I do not have to block out the noise, I do not have to ignore narratives and focus on my craft. I simply think this topic is interesting and Im sorry if you dont.

2024-01-08,1704683484,I love Kyrie Irving," i wasnt sure it would work when they signed him. The narrative was he didnt play defense and caused drama on teams

Well all of that couldnt be farther from the truth about him. He plays his ass off on defense. His hands are insane. He rebounds bigger than he is. He can do anything on offense. Scores at all three levels at will but also is fine playing off the ball if thats what team needs. Absolute dot at the foul line. Incredible teammate- takes young dudes under his wings. No drama whatsoever. Stays up and keeps team around him up. Not talked about much but chose to stay even after it didnt look good down the stretch last year.

But out of all of that, my BIGGEST brag on Ky is that he gets better late in games. He has that ice that you simply cant teach a man. When most ppl get tight, games on line, Ky gets loose and focused man and *that* wins ball games.

Game 1's have been a letdown except against Min, where Kyrie started off strong. He tried in this game 1, just didn't have it. Jkidd will make the needed adjustments. The team will be ready. The jitters were there game 1. Our stars have to step up, and so do the others. Luka will play better and have a few statement games in this series. Fk the curse, Kyrie will be Kyrie game 2 and moving forward. Lively will play better and smarter. PJ and DJJ will knock down there shots and make the right plays. Bench players will step up.

With all that being said, Boston is good. Really good. Us fans know how important game 2 is in this series. The Mavs do. The coaches. The whole organization. The players. Luka. They're gonna win as a team, but Luka is gonna elevate his play. Just watch. Think of your favorite dominant Luka performance in the playoffs and watch him one up it. Luka ""after a loss"" Doncic will be great to watch.

2024-07-01,1719862787,The Mavs have fixed their biggest problem,"We lost the finals because DJJ, PJ and our center duo can't consistently shoot from outside. 

As a team we shot 25% from 3 in the WCF (how did we win in 5?!) and 27.3% in the Finals. That is unacceptable.

* PJ shot 31.4% from 3 in Dallas last year.  
* DJJ shot 34% this year (mostly open 3s) and 25% in the Finals. 
* Neither Gafford nor Lively have a game ready outside shot, Lively fluke aside.
* Hardaway shot 35% both in the season and playoffs - not good enough for a shooting specialist.  He was our best hope at having somebody step up.

The problem with the Mavs is nobody consistently capitalized on Luka's passing and gravity because we had so few true shooters. And it makes no sense because we had so many wide open looks.

Klay, Marshall and Grimes are exactly what the doctor ordered. 

Klay may have fallen off athletically but as a shooter he is still elite, shooting almost 38.7% on 9 attempts per game. And that is the second lowest year of his career. With the space Luka and Kyrie create, he is going to feast.

Marshall shot the same exact % (38.7%) as Klay on almost 5 attempts a game.

Grimes, in his first two seasons averaged 38.4% from 3 on almost 5 attempts a game. He had a down year with injuries and inconsistent minutes but he can get back to that percentage easily.

Basically 3 guys who should be in the 38-42% range from 3 on high volume. And Grimes and Naji are young!",Mavericks,159,https://www.reddit.com/r/Mavericks/comments/1dt1z04/the_mavs_have_fixed_their_biggest_problem/

Its extremely rare for any rookie to make a positive impact to a team getting so many wins, much less a pick outside the top 10.

I mean come on. Luka was moving ok until Dort tripped him once again. Next chance he gets he undercuts Luka during a rebound. Even in the situation where Luka clearly pushes into him - instead of selling the contact to draw a foul on Luka, he grabs him on his way down an pulls him on the floor again. 

Then in the fourth Luka has the ball in a low down dribble and Wallace rushes in from behind full speed and just stepped on his ankle. 

Can't tell me this isn't intentional. Luka was bleeding all over his body after the game. All while we can't get a whistle at all on the offensive end.

2024-07-09,1720496692,Rewatching the Pels/OKC series... Naji Marshall is the TRUTH,"Naji Marshall is a significantly better player than DJJ was.

Much better on offense, and not a smidgen worse on D.

Much respect to DJJ, this is not meant to be a diss thread. I love what he did for the team and like him as a player and human being.

But Naji Marshall is not a replacement, he's a substantial upgrade.

This is a player who was given the ball to bring up the court and set up the offense even with CJ and BI there. Hitting multiple quick release contested threes. Dribble driving into the paint and creating plays at the rim and cross court.

Not all the time, of course. Otherwise he'd be an all-star. But compared to DJJ, his skillset may as well be all-star level. There is a reason they called him ""the Knife"" and I am discovering it in real time. He can handle, pass, score, and shoot all better than DJJ or Josh Green could.

And that's just on offense. On defense, he's the primary defender on SGA and is doing a better job than anyone on our team did. Not just that, but he's also sticking J. Williams and actually has the bulk to prevent him from bullying into the paint.

Imagine that. A player quick and shifty enough to stay in front of SGA in isolation, while also big enough to guard J-Dub. With quick hands that are good at stripping.

Again, all respect to DJJ, but he was not to Chicago what Marshall appears to be to NOLA. And we all know role players are going to have an even easier time playing alongside Luka and Kai.

Marshall knows how to defer too -- not once has he hijacked the offense out of BI or CJ's hands. He patiently waits for the play to come to him, and is all too willing to let the stars cook and play off them.

Klay &gt;&gt;&gt; THJ

Marshall &gt;&gt; DJJ

I'm about to start scouting old Knicks games for Grimes, but just from highlights I can tell his skillset is also more developed than our past guys'.

I want to state again this is not meant in any way to diss our guys, I still love J. Green and DJJ and always will. Especially Josh. Our home grown boy who I miss already.

Just trying to emphasize to anyone still questioning our offseason moves that we're not just in good shape, we're in MUCH BETTER SHAPE than last year.

Maybe I'm just hyped because of the Mavs success this season, but I think on Wednesday, we're going to be witnessing the beginning of a potentially all-time rivalry of this era.

Think back to the Celtics-Lakers rivalry of the early to mid 80s. The Chicago vs Detroit playoff rivalry of the late 80s and early 90s. The New York vs Indiana rivalry of the 90s and early 2000s. The Mavs vs Timberwolves has the potential to become that IMO.

I think Luka and Antman will likely be an all-time classic matchup that people will talk about 20 years from now; two elite players in their primes that have many years of high level basketball left in their careers. Both have the belief that each of them is the best player in the league. Both have extremely talented players around them.

I'm just glad to be here to witness it. As a Mavs fan, win or lose (hopefully win), I'm here for it.",Mavericks,117,https://www.reddit.com/r/Mavericks/comments/1cwpy9u/were_about_to_witness_a_potential_alltime_playoff/
2024-06-18,1718735528,We Ranked Dead Last in FT%,"I honestly think this is one of the top reasons we didnt win the chip this year. 71% at the line in the playoffs. 

We probably would have had close to a cake walk as Boston if we actually made FTs with us closing out all 3 series before the finals 1 game earlier. 

I dont know if its enough to beat Boston but it looks like our guys, particularly Luka was just gassed by game 5. He was short a lot on his shots.  Its not just minutes played that takes a toll as not all minutes are equal but also mental fatigue. Luka and Kyrie could not rest without having to check back in quickly.

2024-02-23,1708711438,The most underrated part of Kyrie is that 77 doesnt have to divert his shot attempts to get Kyrie going despite both being combo guards. Luka is actually taking slightly more shots this year compared to past seasons while Kyrie somehow conjures 27 points playing within the bounds of the system. ,"There was all this talk after last season that Luka has to sacrifice his style, be less ball dominant, take less shots, let Kyrie cook for portions and lay back as a facilitator. 

Luka is still the same relentless ball dominant raging bull on offence on normal possessions. He has in fact slightly more FGA (22.4) and higher USG% than ever. He is taking slightly less plodding drives and more 3s but thats it. 

Kyrie is fitting within the same formidable offensive engine and using Lukas passes which would have gone to Spencer or Bullock in the past to generate even more assists within the system, hitting deep uncontested 3s, turning contested catch and shoot 3s into miracle lane lay up and 1 and sinking last second heaves for 3s. He is taking the same pass or shoot passes at the perimeter that we see guys get for years and playing like an artist within the tight contested confines of the perimeter.

On top of that, he has so many possessions either on fast break or when the opponents has just scored to rush and score when the opponents defence is not set yet. He is incredible in playing in non-set possessions of a turnover because he has a lethal running 3 as well as the goat penetration ability. 

Even when hes playing the minutes without Luka, he doesnt try to play like someone else and dominate the ball. Hes happy to let the likes of Hardy and Green bring the ball up and see what the possibilities are.

He is the best ever Luka ball perimeter player ever and is proving that you dont need to be a catch and shoot statue in that role if youre good enough.

Kyrie is the nitrous working within the same Luka engine. 

* (Lukas FGA is 22.6 with Kyrie this season compared to 22.2 pre-Kyrie last season and 21.6 in 2021-22 in roughly similar minutes (34.5-36 with the lowest  actually being with Kyrie this year)

His actual FGA this season is 23.5 but thats only because he has played 40+ minutes for 25.5 FGA in the Non-Kyrie games which is not a happy place.)",Mavericks,69,https://www.reddit.com/r/Mavericks/comments/1ay77uk/the_most_underrated_part_of_kyrie_is_that_77/

2024-06-07,1717744491,This team has no quit in them.,"I'm so proud of this team's DAWG stat. This team is full of fucking DAWGS. Since March, whenever we go down by a lot, I've had absolute faith we'll pick ourselves back up and make it a real game. Let's look at all the DAWG the Mavs have shown.

* March 17th: Held on against the champs despite a blown 13-point 4th quarter lead and won off the Kyrie game-winner.
* March 29th: Battled back from down 15 and won against the Kings on the road in a must-win for our playoff positioning.
* April 5th: Beat the Warriors without Luka.
* April 7th: The Exum shot. Came back from down 22 against the Rockets, including down 3 without the ball with 20 seconds left.
* April 21st: Went down 29 to the Clippers in Game 1, but kept fighting all the way to the end and cut it to a respectable 12.
* April 28th: Went down 31 in Game 4, but again kept fighting and even went back up, despite the eventual loss to that insane PG shot. Certain teams would have mentally quit long before the 4th quarter.
* May 1st: Needed a road win to avoid going down 3-2. Came out and shellacked the Clippers by 30 in their last home game at Staples.
* May 15th: Same situation against OKC. Came out and controlled the game the whole way on their floor to take the 3-2 lead.
* May 18th: Came back from down 17 to win the series against OKC and go to the WCF.
* May 24th: Came back from down 18 in Game 2 against Minnesota to go up 2-0 on the road.

Even today, though we went down big, we kept fighting. We didn't look prepared to deal with Boston's defense or KP's impact on offense, but I have complete faith we will respond as this team always has when it faces tough situations. I trust in the best basketball player in the world. I trust in the clutchest basketball player in the world. I trust in the coach that has outcoached two COTYs on 1-seeds. I trust in these motherfucking DAWGS.",Mavericks,60,https://www.reddit.com/r/Mavericks/comments/1da4q4q/this_team_has_no_quit_in_them/

2024-06-18,1718681411,This is only the beginning! dallas will win 60 games next season and have a rematch with the Celtics. ,"a few months ago we were worried dallas would not make it out of the play in. now we are feeling the finals loss but the finals wasn't something we even considered at the trade deadline. Now dallas has a fleshed out roster that is under contract for a few years. they have young players in green, hardy, omax, and lively that will only improve and make the team a much better contending team. There are a few players that would need to be moved in order to free up playing time for the young players but dallas is good to compete.

  
the silver lining in this is that it exposed some of the flaws the roster still has and will force the mavericks to address them. Dallas should really focus on running an offensive system besides letting kyrie and luka create, the system wouldn't be for them but for role players to be able to execute so an offensive minded assistant coach would do wonders.

dallas reached the playoffs banged up, specifically luka, so next season rather than trying to jump up from play in to 5th seed dallas can lock in a top 3 seed early and allow luka to come into the playoffs with less wear and tear on his body. hopefully they bring down his minutes from 38 MPG down to about 33-34 so he can give the luka playoff performer we are used to. 

  
just last season we thought dallas was years away, now I see dallas coming back next season and winning 60 wins. ",Mavericks,291,https://www.reddit.com/r/Mavericks/comments/1dih276/this_is_only_the_beginning_dallas_will_win_60/

2024-07-16,1721102426,"Warriors fan here to set the record straight about Klay's defense (spoiler: media narratives about it the last 2 yrs have been so warped that they've become completely detached from reality). Funniest part about the narratives is the 3, where he'll play for y'all, is where he's best now defensively.","I pulled a bunch of Klays defensive possessions from this season - these are mostly from February and March, so definitely just a selection and not remotely the sum total of his defense this season, but figured I'd pull from the most recent games - to show just what I mean about how detached from reality the narrative that he's a ""defensive liability, tantamount to a cone on defense, and/or needs to be hidden on defense is. 

The media harping on his fit defensively with the Mavs has me so annoyed because of how laughably off base it is that I feel like I have a duty, as a longtime Warriors fan who has watched literally every game, every season, to make sure you all know that not only is he not a defensive liability, but ironically enough, where you guys will be playing him (ie at the 3) is where he's best suited and most effective defensively at this stage lol. He can't - and so doesn't - guard fast, twitchy guards at the POA any longer, but he's still very much a high level defender against slower guards and wings and can scale up to effectively guard some of the biggest and best (Jokic, AD, &amp; Brook Lopez to name a few) centers with single coverage if/when he ever finds himself switched onto them, because of how strong he is.   

A big part of what made Klay so elite defensively at his peak was his incredibly sound fundamentals - try to get him dance all you want, he's not gonna bite; elite footwork and use of angles to force the shot he wants the offensive player to take, not the one they want to take; defensive positioning - he's always sitting down, you'll never catch him straight up and susceptible to getting caught on his heels, etc. His ACL and Achilles tears took a step or two away from him laterally*, but they didn't take away any of the aforementioned defensive fundamentals and at the end of the day, those fundamentals are what make great defenders.   

The best, most pure example of this - meaning the ability to be very very good defensively post-injuries that took a hit to a player's athleticism - to drive it home, is Kevon Looney. He's probably the most athletically limited big you will find in the league and yet, is one of the best switchable bigs and one of the only bigs in the league during the Warriors' long run to never get played off the court in the playoffs because of it, locking up prime Harden and Chris Paul &amp; had Brunson in fits during our 2022 WCF series vs you guys. Really great breakdown with game film about his switching defense in the playoffs [here](https://www.nytimes.com/athletic/3323396/2022/05/22/kevon-looney-playoffs-defense/?source=user_shared_article) for proof lol because unless you watched him during those runs and already know, the suggestion that he ever locked up prime Harden or Chris Paul in single coverage out in space would sound ludicrous.   

What makes Loon able to be an incredibly effective switching big and defend out on the perimeter and in space like this despite his two hip surgeries that effectively sapped all of his athleticism, is because he's one of the most defensively sound, fundamentally speaking, guys you'll find in the league. It's that same adherence to bulletproof fundamentals that allows, despite media narratives to the contrary, Klay to still be an incredibly effective defender post-injuries.   

*To be clear, he's not incapable of moving laterally and still can move his feet to keep the vast majority of guys in front of him, he's just a half step slower, which is why he can't keep up with twitchy guards anymore, but slower guards and wings he's got down just fine.

The extent to which the NBA media has completely turned on Luka is outright embarrassing. 

So many ""analysts"" are claiming that it's Luka's defense that cost us the Finals. 

No context that our defense was actually not the problem and that it's our offense that failed or that Luka was playing with multiple injuries including a knee sprain. 

I feel like this is going to affect the voting for awards next year.

2024-05-08,1715170549,[Grant Afseth] Kyrie Irving on defending a player like Shai Gilgeous-Alexander without fouling:,"Long Quote:

""I'm going to show my respect and say that he's a great player. But tonight, in the first half, there wasn't really a rhythm for a lot of players out there. It was a lot of slow down, watching free throws being taken, and adjusting to the way the game was being called. It felt like a regular season game tonight, in my perspective.

I don't speak for anyone else, but I think it was like a regular season game because we came off a very physical series against the LA Clippers, then we had some fouls called, and some of them may have been fouls or a majority of them. But as a competitor, you want the flow of the game to feel like the playoffs, with high physicality. It just feels better. 


It's all about adjustments. It's about continuing to stay positive through some of the runs they make and being mature about who we're going against - a good team that's shown it all year. They have a starting five with a plus-minus through the roof and one of the top defenses. So, we'll give them credit, but we have to come into game two ready and prepared.""

Its incredible. DJJ will kingfuck the production of any player he is on and PJ guards all 5 positions and a 6th one to boot while communicating to the defence. 

I know that Luka and Kyrie are the best players but they can have bad games on offence. This man DJJ  refuses to have a bad game on defence. 

Obviously its great for our ceiling if these guys ball out for three but the reason for our floor to not unravel and the primary reason we are in the finals is our defence and these two have been so consistently driven and intelligent on defence.

According to the article: 

After a very exhausting season, during which he reached the NBA finals with the Mavericks and also supported Slovenia in the Olympic Qualifying Tournament, it was time for Luka Doni to relax.

The Slovenian star stayed in Greece after his country's elimination from the Olympics at the hands of our national team and went to Mykonos for his summer vacation.

There, he even met Giannis Bourousis and took a selfie with him. In the photo, his good friend Jaka Bla~i, who did not participate in the Olympic Qualifying Tournament due to injury, is also present.",Mavericks,78,https://www.reddit.com/r/Mavericks/comments/1e0v9xa/doncic_vacation_in_mykonos/
2024-07-03,1720019153,"[Amick/The Athletic] Why Klay Thompson chose Dallas over the Lakers and put the Warriors in his past
","There's a lot of interesting details, but two are particularly heartening when looking forward at the next season and beyond. Not just Nico but also Finley's role as a trusted ex-player might really change Mavs' prospects going forward.

&gt;And so the series of questions began for Finley, ... He asked about the Dallas scene and Texas living, about the Mavericks fans and the arena environment that came with them. Thompson is a bona fide hooper, no matter the setting, and his regard for Finleys journey and insights came with an authenticity that struck those at the dinner as quintessential Klay.

There have been some concerns if Mavs' offence will fit Klay who's used to a movement heavy offence. Seems like he might be fine with catching the ball wide open and shooting - shocking!

&gt;Thompson had watched the Mavericks Finals run and told those close to him how he envisioned fitting in, creating space for Luka Doni and Kyrie Irving on the offensive end while bringing his championship credentials to their rising program.

2024-05-23,1716436748,Man lets talk about Dereck Lively,"First of all I want to start by saying that Lively needs to start from here on out and he needs to play the majority of the center minutes. Gafford has been pretty bad in a lot of stretches here in these last couple series. Lively in my opinion is a lot smarter even as a rookie and he understands switches better and pick and rolls. He is such an intimidating presence under the rim you can tell that when players drive in they are second guessing whether or not to shoot it. 

Sometimes he gets in trouble by jumping too much and falling for pump fakes but man he has been awesome at the line lately and his pick and roll game offensively is incredible. And playing like this after losing his mom has gained my ultimate respect. Can we show some love to D Live? 


Edit: The point of this post was not to slander Gafford thats not what I am trying to do. He is a great player just playing bad recently in my opinion.

But he was truly the heart and sole of this team.  Him and Jose were our enforcers and he always stood up for his guys and was an excellent figure in community.  Bro is always down to take pictures and talk with fans so just as a human youre getting an A+ human being. As far as his game is concerned bro has grown so much since being an undrafted rookie and has became a more than acceptable three point shooter.  He thrives with the ball in his hands as a playmaker and is going to suprise you with his playmaking abilities.  He works best when he goes iso on defenders and drives as he is very strong and has excellent touch around the rim. Great corner three point shooter and as a spot starter in 22 season he was averaging 16+. The negatives: he has slow foot speed and  his over aggressiveness on defense causes him to get cheap fouls.  Will get cooked by fast guards like Fox but will thrive against guards like shai. Another negative is basketball iq and that is where most Pels fans were drove crazy bye.  Not me cause I always understood his value was above his mistakes but he will play outta control and make some bonehead decisions at time like dribbling off foot or throwing ball 10 feet into stands.  All that being said I just wanted to let you know ur getting a good one.

Given what just happened there was more than enough reason to expect some ""Chippyness"" on that screen. Instead, PJ sets a solid, legal, screen with nothing extra. Just went about his business. Also love that PJ was walking away from Mann after the altercation and no malice or the macho get in your face BS. Then you have the ""Pose"" which was awesome. Like you aren't rattling us. We aren't going away. We aren't backing down. Simply Brilliance.

And even though he pushed Russ it was only after he shoved Luka. That was it. Just a simple you shove my Star im gonna shove you. When he gets ejected for his second T there was no cursing and swearing at the refs, just grabs a towel and hustles off the court. To wild cheering from the Mavs faithful. LOVE IT.

In the NBA finals. Being behind 0-2. I don't care how much you do on offense. Truly pathetic and simply not the behavior of a champion.

How many mental lapses can you have on defense? 

I can't put into words how disappointed I am of this. Really thought we would run away with it, with KP being out. Congrats to the Celtics, they beat us in every way possible. 

I don't want this series to have any redeeming qualities anymore. No fucking excuses. I want this to be as painful as possible for this team and especially for Luka.

2024-06-02,1717365420,Boston fans have no idea what's about to happen to them,"**EDIT**: Congratulations to the Boston Celtics and fans. Great team, great season. I obviously thought things would go differently, and I couldn't have been more wrong. Love you guys. I had to close my DMs because of the guy who kept sending me tentacle porn, but if you wanna keep shitting on me in here, feel free.

Losing sucks. Still, getting to the Finals is better than getting kicked in the dick. Mavs fans, there's work to be done. Let's fucking go!

  


I have a few friends and relatives who are Boston fans. I respect their passion and they can trash talk as well as me, which is nice. This week, though I realized they've been living in a bubble. It's a lot of ""I'm not worried, our team is obviously the superior team. You have a nice little story for a 5 seed"". These people have not been watching any non-Celtics basketball games, and are just deep in Celtics message boards. All they know about Luka is that he whines and he's a flopper (lol)

Bro, your team is out there getting cooked by T.J. McConnell and Aaron Nesmith. We have the best player in the world. They are not ready for this.

That's the thing about Luka though. You have to actually watch him play. If all you do is watch SportsCenter highlights and listen to podcasts you can't understand what he's doing. He's not like LeBron or Kobe or Giannis where you can tell 10 seconds that he's the best player on the floor. He wears you down over time.

Watch Luka 5 minutes: Who the hell is this guy.  He's slow and out of shape, he can't jump, he doesn't play defense, and he's bitching about calls on every play. This is the guy you're telling me is the future of basketball?

Watch him for 20 minutes: How did that shot go in? Wait are we just gonna leave guys open in the corner for him to pass to every time? Why aren't we defending Luka he's slow we should put people on him!

Watch him for one game: He got lucky so many of his 3s went in. It'll be different next time. He'll fold once someone punches him in the face and the refs won't listen to his crying.

Watch about a month: Holy shit how does anybody ever beat this guy.

This is why he's even better in the playoffs. One game during the regular season sure you can do what you can to hold him in and move on the next day. Having to face him night after night is a nightmare. We're see it series after series by the time these teams get to game 5 or 6 they just look completely cooked.

The Celtics are soft and the East is a joke. Boston fans who think they're just gonna walk to a championship are about to find out. I can't wait to hear their whining excuses.",Mavericks,907,https://www.reddit.com/r/Mavericks/comments/1d6ojsh/boston_fans_have_no_idea_whats_about_to_happen_to/

2024-07-03,1720026884,A lifelong Warriors fan on Klay ,"Klay is an absolute legend through and through. And youre going to hear stuff in the coming days and weeks about being washed, selfish this and that.

Dont buy it. The Warriors ownership has been inching closer and closer to being the spitting image of Jerry Krause in the late 90s for some time now. The last 5 years have been marred by a front office prioritizing rookies and the year 2030 over our core players. Our 2022 title was in despite of the ownership of the team, and they even admitted they werent trying to compete that year and were shocked at the result.

The resulting angst around Klay has been because he has not been willing to step aside for unproven players that truthfully are not high value prospects. But management wants them to be. So when people call him selfish, its because hes desperate to win and not eager to be a sage advisor on a bad team. The shot selection , while he can be bold , also was a reflection of a team that only had one other shooter on the roster this year.

And despite all this, he was willing to take a smaller role and a 2/40 contract from us and our owner gave him a cold shoulder, all too excited to start a rookie who averaged 9 points and shot 34% from distance in a 63 frame when he was given the chance to start. Unfortunately, some in the Bay have been red pilled to buy into this. But thats the same crowd that thought we gave up on James Wiseman too soon (it wasnt soon enough)

He made 268 threes this year on a team that didnt have to be guarded outside the paint and yet simultaneously had no interior scoring threat. The level of shot making he displayed was completely under valued because he couldnt lift up what was objectively an idiotic roster construction. What he cant do anymore is cut hard toward the rim. But with the spacing you have, it will still be easier for him

Defensively , theres much said about a drop off. Here is the truth. He cannot get around screens. That is gone. But his man to man defense on wings is still reliable. When we played teams like LAC, Orlando and Phoenix he was our guy for Kawhi, KD and Banchero and he did an admirable job. He has strengths and weaknesses on that end. But so much of the washed allegations come from a situation that had Chris Paul as the help defender at 511 and 39 years old. With actual size next to him, this wont be nearly as much of an issue

You guys got objectively one of the best shooters ever who is a wildly competitive and prideful person. And we in Golden State , barring an immediate title winning turnaround , are going to have a stain on us for decades to come the way we disrespected one of our most cherished players.
