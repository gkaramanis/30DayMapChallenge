2024-04-21,1713678528,Why We Are Here,"\*\*Gonna get downvoted to hell, but f\*\*\* it. I wanna say this\*\*

The Orlando Magic kicked off the rebuild in the 2021 season by trading off the previous core at the deadline. Since then, the plan has been rehabilitate Isaac and Fultz, acquire young talent and draft capital, and develop said young talent. 

While Fultz has continued to be derailed by injuries, (including knee tendonitis which appears to have also aggravated his TOS), Jonathan Isaac played 58 games and made it to the post season healthy. Young star duo Franz Wagner and Paolo Banchero have emerged as legitimate top options on a playoff team, leading the Magic to the 5th seed. 22 year old guard Jalen Suggs has emerged as one of the NBA's best 3 and D players, with possible nomination to his first (of many) all defensive team. 

Orlando has successfully acquired young talent and rehabilitated one of their projects. Now what's next is to develop their core. After a successful season where the Magic won 47 games, the most since the 2011 season, the Orlando Magic find themselves in the playoffs as the 5th seed. While nothing is set in stone yet, the Magic have found success with 4 core players leading the way. Franz Wagner, Paolo Banchero, Jonathan Isaac, and Jalen Suggs. The task now is to get their feet wet with some post season basketball.

Right out the gate, NBA ALL STAR Paolo Banchero showed that despite only being 21 years old, he was comfortable in a playoff setting. He put up a statline of 24 points, 7 rebounds, and 5 assists on 9/17 shooting from the field (52.9%). While he had his struggles, namely 9 turnovers, he was one of Orlando's few bright spots and showed that he is not afraid of the big moments. 

Orlando's second star, Franz Wagner, started the game with 6 points in the first quarter and showed that he too was ready for the playoffs. But when Cleveland switched to the zone, Franz struggled to adjust to the physicality and schemes of the playoffs for quarters 2 and 3. The lights appeared to be a bit bright for him, but then he adjusted in the 4th, dropping 8 points and finally knocking down 2 3s. If there is a silver lining, it's that Franz looked comfortable dealing with the zone in the 4th and hopefully he can carry that confidence into the rest of the series. He recorded 18 points, 7 rebounds, 3 assists, 1 steal, and 3 blocks on 7/15 shooting from the field (46.7%) and 0 turnovers.

Jonathan Isaac made his return to the starting lineup for back to back games, the previous being the final game of the regular season. While JI is mainly relied upon for his historic defensive prowess, he recorded 10 points and 5 rebounds to help the struggling Magic pull within striking distance on multiple occasions. Only 3/8 shooting from the field (37.5%), but he did knock down 2 3s on 2/4 shooting (50%). The 6'11 forward was an active presence on the defensive end all game, recording 3 steals and 3 blocks. His defensive impact is one of the reasons Orlando was able to stay in the game for so long despite a woeful outing from most of the players.

Coming into this post season, one of the players garnering the most hype was Jalen Suggs. Because of his ultra competitive spirit and college postseason run, many assumed he would rise to the occasion when the lights were brightest. The 22 year old guard struggled to adjust to the post season, shooting 4/16 from the field (25%) and 1/7 from 3 (14.3%). Despite his poor offensive play, his heart and impact still affected the game as he hounded Darius Garland on defense and recorded his signature moment of the playoffs (in game 1) with a steal on the former all star, then the dunk.

Orlando Magic head coach Jamahl Mosely had a shaking game for his playoff debut as well. He had questionable rotations, such as all bench lineups and the lack of staggering Franz and Paolo, along with struggling to make adjustments to J.B. Bickerstaff's zone defense. Despite his struggles as a coach, there were bright moments as well. Coach Mosely was quick to call timeouts to stop large Cavs runs and was quick to use his coach's challenge as well. 

This playoff run is a first for the majority of this young Orlando Magic team, including the coach, so the goal of this season is for everyone to gain experience and learn what it takes to win at the highest level. Paolo, Franz, Jalen, and JI each got the taste the waters of the post season today and each walked away having learned something. 

Winning 47 games and making the playoffs has made this season a massive success, no matter what happens from here on out. However, the players and coach gaining experience and learning what it takes to win is a massive bonus and is the main goal currently. In game 1, Cleveland shot out to an early lead that they would never lose and Orlando struggled to find any offense for most of the game. Every team must go through this, being punched in the mouth during the first playoff run is tradition in the NBA. But that doesn't mean the players should give up and in game 1, they showed they wouldn't, fighting until the final buzzer and even pulling within single digits in a final run that Cleveland survived.

Orlando has a chance to tie up the series in game 2, but perhaps the most important thing about this series is what the Magic can take into the offseason. Paolo and Franz need to become better shooters if they want to prevent teams from limiting their effectiveness with the zone defense. Franz specifically needs to add additional scoring moves to his repertoire if he wants to take the next step forward into stardom. Jalen needs to work on his ball handling to take the pressure off of Franz and Paolo as well as allow himself to better leverage his improved shooting and quick bursts to the rim. The team as a whole needs to work on 3pt shooting attacking mismatches. Coach Mosely needs to develop an offense that leverages the gravity of his 2 stars to create better shots for the rest of his players, rather than relying on what his 2 best players can create in isolation.

After game 1, I personally am feeling even more excited than I did before the game began. Despite arguably the worst offensive performance this team has had all season long, the Magic still remained in the game, even pulling within striking distance multiple times in the second half. Orlando's defense was certainly playoff caliber, holding the Cavs to 97 points. And Franz appears to have adjusted to the playoffs in the 4th quarter, which I am hopeful will carry on for the rest of the series. This series is far from over, but the thing I'm most interested in is whether or not the young Magic learn something from this experience. I feel that the core 4 and coach did in game 1 and hope they will continue to soak up knowledge in each of the remaining games.

This is year 3 of the rebuild. Orlando is led by the youngest stars of the playoffs, the youngest all star in the NBA, and Paolo is only in year 2 while Franz is only in year 3. There is plenty of development to come before Orlando is ready to take the step toward contention, but this experience will certainly speed up the timeline. Win or Lose, there is something to be excited about in Orlando and this is the first time in over a decade that the city and fandom have hope.",OrlandoMagic,36,https://www.reddit.com/r/OrlandoMagic/comments/1c9aj6z/why_we_are_here/

When he came in he immediately started cooking us and was an extreme mismatch for us defensively, put simply we dont have the personnel to guard someone like him. He scored like 10 points in what felt like 20 seconds. He got subbed out mid way through the second quarter I believe? and my dad and I both had a sigh of relief. 

We were dreading when he was going to check back in which& for some reason didnt happen until there were 3 minutes left in the 3rd quarter? He once again made a huge impact and then I think checked back out, and then played at the end of the game for a little bit I think. He finished with 25 points in like 23 minutes or something prett crazy.

Was this just a really good game from him? Does he not usually see many minutes? Does your coach just have set rotations he doesnt deviate from?

2024-02-09,1707449623,Steve Ceruti Appreciation,"His take on Simmon's podcast is always very level headed. He seems to see the whole picture instead of just being reactionary to whatever's currently happening. I like his response to the lack of moves by Orlando in pt2 of the trade deadline episode. Russillo agreed and it sounded to me like Bill did too. He made some excellent points.

We even got a shout out. Bill mentioned see Isaac defend Tatum next time they place and Ceruti said ECF!

Having him on such a high profile show intermittently to represent us is pretty lucky.

But seriously, his points about Isaac's D and him guarding the best player on a team in the playoffs (with less or without minute limitations) will be crazy.

Having Black develop more before a possible playoff run this year.

Paulo and Franz and Suggs continuing to develop rather than possibly stunting their growth, ala Mobley. Look at how far they've come in such a short time. Suggs 3 coming with D. His rookie year his handle was weak. Now it's good and he's shooting really well. 

We have some of the best defenders in the entire NBA who are working on shooting and rapidly improving (Suggs, Black), and Isaac's shot would probably be way better if he didn't always get hurt.

Some of our players are just getting healthy. Wendell shooting 3s helps a lot with spacing. Franz seems to have found his shot again. Black is semi reliable now. And we have one of the easiest remaining schedules. I see a strong finish to the season.

I added a lot of my own thoughts in, but his point seems to ultimately be that this isn't our year to possibly win it all. We'll probably make it regardless and get great experience for our players to make a run for next year and the following several.",OrlandoMagic,21,https://www.reddit.com/r/OrlandoMagic/comments/1amenrm/steve_ceruti_appreciation/

But Orlando at number 20 I'm gonna, every time I do this I'm gonna have a BSS all star of the week and it's gonna be, I used to do this when I, when I wrote my column back in the day JI used to call 'em the Bill Simmons all stars. Just people that I just liked for whatever reason. I love Jalen Suggs. I don't really know fully what he is. He tries harder than everybody on every other team. He really gives a shit. He feels additive in all these different ways and, and yet at the same time he'll absolutely like Airball a three in one of the biggest moments of the game. 

But that guy caress, I watched a game where he got this hustle rebound, I can't remember who they, they lost at the buzzer, get this hustle rebound and dribbled back out and took a three and missed it and put his jersey over his head for like the next minute and a half. I actually think he might've been crying. He was so upset they lost. He is the most competitive random guy in the league. I love Jalen Sugg. Ohs said it's a Laker game. I love Jalen Suggs. I don't know what he is. He might just end up being like a seventh man on a championship team at some point he's gonna have a moment on a good team. I don't know if Orlando's gonna be the team, but it's gonna happen for that dude.",OrlandoMagic,36,https://www.reddit.com/r/OrlandoMagic/comments/17qyva2/bill_simmons_showing_jalen_some_love/

Watching Jalen Suggs, Im not surprised our defensive rating is that good. Regardless of his offensive woes I think he is very important to the success and identity of his team. 

Overall, I think the defense is going to be the main reason we may make the play-in or even full on playoffs.

They exceed expectations. The summer will be interesting, we have a ton of ca$h to go after 1 or 2 new players to pair with our crew. I would throw a bag at Derrick White and try and snag him from BOS. Would target Malik Monk as my second ideally. There are other shooters out there for the FO to find if they don't work out. I trust them. We need 2 bonafide shooters who can defend...one who can run point would be ideal. Let Chumma and Gary walk. Resign Fultz to a super team friendly deal. Then run it back. I don't think we should go after PG-13 or Clay. Paolo is SUPER SPECIAL and we need to make it all about building around him as the #1 but not only option. Franz and Suggs are developing into future all stars and we need to nurture them as well.

They only had one game with national coverage for the entire season. I know this team will get a lot more going forward because how it looks right now as they will be a playoff team. 

I just find it funny how we have Paolo Banchero, who was the number one overall pick in 2023 and he barely gets any love around league outside of the players and he was an all-star this season. Wemby is on a team that is far from going to the playoffs this season and yet he gets so much love from the media and he was also a first overall pick.

But also talk about these two players, its funny when people talk about the future faces of the NBA, how Wemby is talked about highly for that and Banchero is never mentioned . Also, SGA who plays in Oklahoma City, which is also a small market team, is mentioned a lot.

2024-01-29,1706555571,Why Jett Howard isnt getting minutes.,"Theres been an outcry of fans wanting to see Howard on the court just for the hell of it (theres no denying he has a smooth jumper). I understand it. Im a magic lifer and work in basketball for my career. Stops along the way for me include the Spurs and NY Liberty in various capacities from lineup analysis to opponent scouting. Hes my reasons why Jett isnt happening. 

#1 Hes been a walking turnover at the GLeague level. His 0.58 AST/TO ratio is worst among all guards on the roster. In my opinion this is really hurting his stock with the big club. The GLeague is a league of offensive firepower so turning it over so much against lesser defensive schemes is concerning (hes a rookie though so this is expected)

#2 Second worst individual defensive rating on the GLeague roster. The nba Magic are near the top in nearly every defensive category. It would take a multitude of injuries for Mose and the staff to give him meaningful minutes. As soon as he touches the court the opposition would immediately look to expose him. Jett has struggled to defend in the GLeague and tonight you could guarantee the Mavs would do everything in their power to schematically work Jett onto Luka every single possession. Its how the league works. 

#3 Queen is getting his run because hes experienced as a pro. Additionally, in the event someone facts checks, while Queen is worst in defensive rating on the GLeague magic ahead of Jett, Queen is #1 in AST/TO ratio and top 30 in the GLeague among qualifying players. He can be trusted with the ball, Jett cannot. Its not complicated. (Houstan for what its worth also has the lowest TO rate on the nba magic, the shots may not be falling but again, he can be trusted in the flow of offense)

Food for thought as we work towards the allstar break. I can imagine Jett is getting a lot of attention at both levels when it comes to understanding Moses concepts so he can work his way into the rotation at some point in the next year or so.",OrlandoMagic,46,https://www.reddit.com/r/OrlandoMagic/comments/1ae3fyu/why_jett_howard_isnt_getting_minutes/
2024-01-08,1704684008,Houstan appreciation thread!,"I made the Queen one a little late as I had to watch the Denver game on record but this Atlanta game Paolo's partner in crime was CALEB!

He was deadly with the 3 ball in catch and shoot even with defenders in his face.  The real surprising component, though, was his defense.  He was all over the court contesting shots, cutting of driving lanes and closing out.  

Just such a great sign that guys have no fear to step-up in critical situations.  This coaching staff is amazing.",OrlandoMagic,17,https://www.reddit.com/r/OrlandoMagic/comments/191b55y/houstan_appreciation_thread/

The Book is about the first two years in Orlando from the perspective of their mother, including the world championship win in 2023. A lot of stuff about living in Orlando, facilities of the magic, some words of Franz, Moe, Coach Mosley and other people.

Asked Moe to sign with wishes of becoming 2025 NBA dunk contest champ. He was a little hesitating, but encouraged himself doing it, with ""i wish"". He f-d it up a little bit writing ""with dunk contest 2025"" instead of ""nba dunk contest 2025"", but I can understand it, there were around 1500 people for the book signings.

The youth club Alba won their do or die game in the semis and is playing this week for the german championship against Bayern Munich. (1-1 at the moment, best of five).

2024-09-06,1725660861,Jalen Suggs is going to be the most interesting player to follow next season,"Jalen Suggs is the X-factor for our success next year in my opinion, and his performance might be the storyline I focus on the most. 

For one, hes going to see a pretty big change in his role in operating the offense. He no longer has to defer to Markelle, and hes going to be that guy who controls the flow of the offense when the ball is out of Paolo and Franzs hands or theyre in foul trouble/resting. 

Hes a fantastic All NBA-defense combo guard as it is, but is he going to trusted all season to run the type of sets / control the offense in the way that youd except your starting PG on any other team to? Id expect he wont be asked to do a lot of that initially, because as mentioned we already have two tall ass forwards who can be asked to run a set with confidence, but his further development as a playmaker can give our team an added option to attack defenses. 

Suggs shot an amazing 39.7% from 3 last year. He has seen a massive jump in efficiency year-to-year from deep since he has been drafted, going back to when he shot an abysmal 21%, only averaging 0.4 makes from 3 a game, in his rookie year. I dont think it can be understated how incredible that improvement is, and to me his form has always passed the eye test , even as a prospect. 

Is he going to show that same consistent from deep next season on possibly higher volume? Or is he going to bounce back down to around league average? It cant be understated how badly we need one of these young guys to become near automatic from 3 on a consistent basis. KCP can shoot, but having multiple floor stretches is the hallmark of any contending roster. We simply dont have that yet on paper, although I do believe in Da Silvas shooting and expect improvement from our other core guys this year anyways. 

Though he will never be a high volume scorer with Paolo and Franz on the roster (thats also not his role and thats more than fine), he has the potential to grow into a well rounded playmaker who will always be a threat from 3, combined with his already incredible defense. Is he going to realize those roles fully or will this teams playmaking once again be inconsistent due to a variety of factors that may or may not be completely of Suggs control (3pt shooting/spacing/team health)? 

Either way, I believe calling on him to step into a different role is going to be huge for his confidence and development, and im excited to see how he improves.

By the way, he just turned 23 only 3 months ago. Someone get this man a contract extension?",OrlandoMagic,13,https://www.reddit.com/r/OrlandoMagic/comments/1farl23/jalen_suggs_is_going_to_be_the_most_interesting/

2024-05-06,1714992338,Opinion from an almost 3 decade Magic fan,"Quick backstory, I first became a Magic fan at the age of 5 in 1995 when my family relocated from Connecticut to Orlando. My first game was an eastern conference semifinals game vs the Bulls that my late uncle took me to. What a time to be alive! Shaq and Penny vs Jordan and Pippen&

That said, being 34 years old now, Ive stuck by my beloved Magic in the few good and many too many not so good years. Im incredibly proud of this young team and what theyve accomplished this season, as we all should be. I feel like Playing the Song after every dub has helped us unite as fans and I think we have more fun after dubs than any other team for it. 

While this season didnt work out the way wed hoped, I feel our future is bright. I recall the 2007 and 2008 playoffs where we got slaughtered by the Pistons, the former year being a sweep. This current team is better than those 2 in terms of wins based off this latest series. If management can continue to nurture these guys and allow them to blossom (and not send them to the Lakers for cash considerations) I see a championship in our future. 

How can any non-Magic NBA fan not respect the way our guys have been playing? They play with all their heart and soul because theyre young, hungry, and have a deep desire to WIN! Stay in faith, great things are coming Orlandos way! I believe and declare that next NBA season were going to see the Orlando Magic conquer teams no one believes they can. 

And of course the non-believers will still say were a joke of a team. Cmon man, the Magic cant pull it off, they never have I can recall even when we made it to the finals in 2009, we STILL werent taken seriously as a team by anyone. Next season us Magic fans will say No thanks, we know what our team is capable of, its not my fault somethings wrong with you

In the meantime, lets enjoy Boston getting their brooms for Cleveland

2024-03-24,1711248783,Jonathan Isaacs game tonight,"Tonight, I was at the Kings game and Jonathan Isaac legitimately received MVP chants during free throws in the fourth quarter. When he checked in for the first time in the second half, it was some of the loudest applause I had heard at a Magic game for a player in some time. 

This came after his monster 17pt first half performance, and he finished the game with 25 points. He had some nice defensive plays and was locked in on the boards. Watching him out hustle Sabonis was awesome. As soon as Isaac was subbed out for Mo, the Kings went on a run and he was subbed back in almost immediately. 

At this point its hard to deny, he is going to be important if we are trying to get out of the first round. I am glad to see that based off tonight, our fans opinion on him is turning around. I hope he can keep it up!",OrlandoMagic,16,https://www.reddit.com/r/OrlandoMagic/comments/1bmai3z/jonathan_isaacs_game_tonight/

2024-05-09,1715295380,Orlando may have pulled off a sneaky great move with the pick swap trade last off-season,"[https://www.nba.com/news/magic-first-round-pick-swap-suns-2026](https://www.nba.com/news/magic-first-round-pick-swap-suns-2026)

I think this move is flying under the radar, but very intriguing...  
  
  
If my understanding is correct, this trade gives Orlando unprotected pick swap rights to one of either the Suns' or Wizards' first round pick in 2026. 

- With the trajectory of Orlando only going upward, it means our own pick will probably be in the mid-late 20's by this point in time.

- With the trajectory of the objective dumpster-fire that is Washington, and the apparent/impending dumpster-fire that is Phoenix, it could very well mean they are both picking in the lottery in 2026. And Orlando will be entitled to one of those picks. 

  
This could be draft capital the Magic use to bolster their team with young talent, or it could be a very valuable trade piece when the timing is right to bag another superstar",OrlandoMagic,14,https://www.reddit.com/r/OrlandoMagic/comments/1coak5q/orlando_may_have_pulled_off_a_sneaky_great_move/

2024-03-11,1710124581,Today the heat just lost to the wizards healthy and the knicks lost to the sixers without Maxey and Joel,Point being shit happens I learned that you can lose on any given night in the NBA because every team also has nba players and they also get paid to win. Pacers and knicks were prideful not trying to get swept by us in the season series. We are young and inexperienced and we are still the 5th seed after these two loses. All we should want this season is for the team to get some playoff experience anything else is a bonus. ,OrlandoMagic,33,https://www.reddit.com/r/OrlandoMagic/comments/1bbsibo/today_the_heat_just_lost_to_the_wizards_healthy/

Winning teams really need a guy like Suggs who plays hard and sets the tone and actually gives a shit. Jaylen Brown and Jayson Tatum definitely picked up on that with Marcus Smart and I see a lot of that in Suggs. Hes on my short list of guys I wish were in Boston.


I also think Cole Anthony is super underrated.",OrlandoMagic,19,https://www.reddit.com/r/OrlandoMagic/comments/18kvz0u/boston_fan_jalen_suggs_appreciation/

2024-05-24,1716577968,Anthony Black to Orlando?,"Think we could use the PG we drafted in the lottery last year? I noticed his defense is good, good passing and well liked team player. Shooting improved in rookie season and he performed fairly well as a rookie.

Should we just totally give up on him and trade assets for a mediocre short lived upgrade, or possibly give him a chance to run it with more experience and a summer to practice?

Yes this is mildly a shitpost. No I'm not saying don't look at other PGs or sign anyone. I'd love shooting, especially at PG. But I almost guarunfuckingtee the team is gonna give AB a chance. Especially when this playoffs has reinforced the power of lockdown team D. And from his growth in year one.

2023-11-03,1699019477,Going 2-2 on the West Coast road trip was actually a very good result,"Yes I know our two wins came against lottery teams, but we need to remember how young this team is and the collective shooting slump weve had to battle through to begin the season. The biggest thing I also wanna point out here is that I believe last year, we would have dropped one (if not both) of the Blazers and Jazz games. Those are fellow young teams that gave us a fight on the road, and last year that was one of the exact situations we really struggled in. 

We went 14-27 on the road last season. This year we came out of a Western Conference road trip 2-2 and we pulled out those 2 wins while in a shooting slump.

2024-08-10,1723300380,Final Summary of Franz Wagner's Olympic Run,"With the disappointing defeats to France and Serbia ending his historic German run, Franz Wagner will be returning home without an Olympic medal. Between now and October 1st, he has about 7 weeks to work on his game before training camp. Let's review what the 6'10 German wing has shown us over the past month and what he still needs to improve on before the season begins.

**Strengths**

Physical Tools:

Franz clearly put on muscle between the playoffs and the Olympic exhibition games, there's no denying it at this point. He's stronger with a quicker burst and even looks a bit more explosive than before. With this, he's been able to finish through contact, bump defenders out of his way, and take on physical defensive assignments. I've been VERY impressed with the way he's added bully ball to his game, rather than always relying on finesse and now that he has both in his bag, he's become a problem for defenses to deal with.

Franz has also gotten faster, blowing by defenders in transition and making decisions so quick that even DPOY runner up Victor Wembanyama found himself on a poster.

  
Finishing:

Not only has he finished well through contact, but when his drives have been successfully interrupted by the defense, Franz has switched to his floaters and hooks well which are becoming more reliable. I'd like to see continued improvement from this area, because this could make him dangerous if these became automatic, given his ability to always get near the rim. This was one of the areas I've been critical of Franz on improving and he did look much improved during these Olympics. He's also finished some difficult crafty layups near the basket and by the time the Olympic playoffs started, teams were afraid to even let him near the rim.

Playmaking:

Passing, ball handling, leveraging defense attention, whatever you want to draw attention to, he's done well. During the France vs Germany game, France sent doubles at him nearly every time he got close to the 3 point arc on the perimeter and blitzed him on every single screen, even if he received one near half court. France was clearly determined to not allow Franz to get downhill and dared anyone else to beat them and Franz leveraged that defensive attention by finding the short roller (usually Theis) which led to open shots. Theis finished the game with 6 assists and Germany had many opportunities just off of this simple trick that may have been borrowed from the Warriors, namely the Steph and Draymond pick n short roll. Missed shots and turnovers became the undoing for Germany in that game, but it is worth noting that the only time Germany was able to create any decent looks was with Franz running to offense. 

I've been very much impressed with his ball handling and creation ability. He's had no issue changing directions, using a variety of dribble moves and counters, and not turning the ball over, given how high his usage rate was. He genuinely moved and played like a guard who happened to be 6'10 rather than a point forward.

Isolation:

It hasn't mattered who's guarded him during this run, Franz has been able to iso any and everyone without fear. Whether his defender has been Yuta Watanabe, Rui Hachimura, Nic Batum, Bilal Coulibaly (elite in NBA), Victor Wembanyama, or Rudy Gobert, Franz has taken them off the dribble and scored without issue. Taking the 7'4 alien to the rim and finishing over his 8' wingspan while talking trash to him multiple times in the same game in certainly something to brag about. He's had a few interesting step backs fall for him from deep, but I'll talk about his shooting later.

  
Defense:

This is one area that Philip RR of the Orlando Magic Daily has been calling attention to on Twitter, his podcast LockedOnMagic, and in his articles at OrlandoMagicDaily.com. Philip believes that Franz's defense has been so impressive that he could be gunning for an all defensive team this year. At first, even I myself was skeptical. While Franz has always been a very good defender, he's usually just a step behind when it comes to guarding the truly elite players. For me, Franz has always been a very good defender, but maybe a tier below elite which is nothing to sneeze at. But as the tournament went on, my eyes started to open at what was in front of me. Ignoring his 2 steals a game, his on ball and off ball defense have been nothing short of elite. He's guarded everyone Germany has needed him to and I don't think there's a game that highlights this more than the 2nd France game. 

Franz started the France game guarding Batum and Germany quickly takes a double digit lead. Franz picks up 2 early fouls and has to sit for most of the 2nd quarter. During this time, France takes advantage of Franz's absence to chip away at the deficit. Cordinier (starting point guard) is given the green light and absolutely abused Dennis Schroder and the German defense, and the game was tied at halftime. With no other options, Germany is forced to move Franz to point guard, having him glue to Cordinier and absolutely shutting him down, while creating for Germany on the other end to keep them in the game. France takes advantage of the size mismatch with Victor Wembanyama down low, who is able to make things difficult on the German defense. So they stick Franz on the 7'4 alien and he's unable to scoring, missing all his shot attempts against Franz and recording a turnover when he tried to get fancy with the dribbling. But now, Cordinier is again free to put the German defense in rotation, leading to more easy points. In this game, Franz guarded the Point Guard, Small forward, and Center and shut them all down in his minutes. In fact, when Franz was on the floor, his team outscored France by 9 points (game high), but Germany was outscored by 13 points when Franz was on the bench, leading to a 4 point loss. 

Everything from his defensive instincts, strength, quickness, and IQ are all improved and now I'm on the same page as Philip RR. I could see Franz on the all defensive ballot by the end of the year.

  
Aggression:

The number 1 thing I've wanted out of Franz since he was a rookie was for him to be more aggressive and he's done that this tournament. There have many many games where he demanded the ball and went to work to put the game out of reach. His shot attempts are up from the World Cup and he's not backing down from rim protectors at the rim. After a back and forth chess match between he and the Cavs bigs in the playoffs, I was interested to see how he's overcome his issue with rim protectors, who always seem to bother him at the rim. This time, he's taken it to the rack against the 2 best ones on the planet multiple times. He's taken contact from them and thrown off their timing with delayed steps, switching hands, and fast twitch layups. And when he decides to be a menace, he's posterized them. If Franz brings this level of aggression into the regular season, he'll be a problem for defenses on a nightly basis.

  
**Weaknesses**

  
Shooting:

Shooting. Schießen. Tiroteo. Tiyita. Tournage. Whatever language you want to say it in, it's shooting. From the midrange or the 3, his shot is broken. He's added arc to his shots, but they're still falling short consistently. This is problematic because Franz is a wizard off the ball, but cutting is only half his game. His relocation 3s from his first 2 seasons has created many easy points for himself and made him an easy find for ball handlers. And he's leveraged this to create more cutting lanes for himself and teammates. Without this, Franz is leaving so many points on the table and these 18 point games are really 22-25 point games that didn't reach their potential. He had an amazing play in which he crossed Victor Wembanyama, made him fall to the ground, then missed the wide open midrange shot off the front of the rim. This play could've been everywhere, but instead it's lost to history. 

The 2 positives I can come away with after this tournament are: he's still hitting his free throws at a high rate (88%) and his shots that are missing are all falling short. The latter is good because it means that he is working on shooting and there is consistency in the results. It'd be alarming if his shots were missing in different directions every time. He needs to get back to work and edit his shot form. He might even need to see a shot doctor to rebuild his mechanics. But it is doable. 

  
Rebounding:

I've been impressed with some of his rebounds this tournament, but he just doesn't seem interested in grabbing defensive boards. I'm not sure if this is Germany's gameplan because having him in transition is more important than staying back to help on the glass or if this is his own decision making. On one hand, I'd like to see him close out more possessions. On the other hand, Germany is fine rebounding without him and benefits far more from him in transition. But this is the only other area of concern I've had for him this Olympic tournament. 

  
**Conclusion**

Franz has improved a ton in the 6 weeks he's had to train this offseason and is looking to be in for a monster season, even without the shooting improvement. He still has about 7 weeks between now and the start of training camp to continue working on his game. If he takes time off from basketball like he usually does after a long tournament/season, that should leave him with about 4 weeks to train. I am eager to see what he brings into the preseason and whether he can do something about that shot in that time.

I apologize for not having the usual film and stats to show you. These Olympic guys have been tough on copyright and stats are tough to get other than raw box score data. So to atone, please accept these highlights that I was able to get and can use on this post.

2024-06-27,1719519071,Orlando Magic General Manager Anthony Parker hinted at Jett Howard (who spent his rookie season in Osceola) being in the rotation in his sophomore season today on @969gameon  We think that hes gonna be someone that helps us with a lot of the shooting that people say we need,,OrlandoMagic,45,https://www.reddit.com/r/OrlandoMagic/comments/1dq0u4n/orlando_magic_general_manager_anthony_parker/
2024-05-21,1716325448,Anfernee Simons vs Malik Monk,"Blazer fan coming in peace. Curious about the Magic fan base perspective on trading for shooting vs signing a shooter in FA. Would a more talented guard be better than a cheaper guard that doesnt require relinquishing assets or young talent?

I think its safe to say Simons is better overall than Monk, and younger with a similar AAV contract. but how much would you be willing to give up for him or a similar player rather than just throw a bag at the player that gives you 80% and keep all your draft capital? 

Edit 2: thanks for the thoughtful engagement! Im going to go back to my own teams sub but this has been insightful, looking forward to seeing what yall do this summer. 

Edit: the trade framework below is not mine, just an idea I have seen from Blazers forums. I understand its an overpay lol please dont yell at me. 

E.g. Blazers fans in most hypotheticals want some version of 1-2 protected FRP + Anthony Black for Simons.

Ill go first: based in the southeast of England and I follow Orlando because my grandma had a place there while I was growing up where I spent a lot of time as a kid& 

(although only ever been to one live game: a pretty boring one at Amway against a then-New Orleans Hornets team featuring some kid called Anthony Davis, no idea what became of him&) ",OrlandoMagic,282,https://www.reddit.com/r/OrlandoMagic/comments/1cicc1m/where_you_from_and_why_orlando/
2024-02-15,1707983504,Just popped up on my Facebook memories from seven years ago today.,,OrlandoMagic,39,https://www.reddit.com/r/OrlandoMagic/comments/1arachl/just_popped_up_on_my_facebook_memories_from_seven/
2024-01-10,1704901122,"Fultz, Isaac, Chuma, and Harris have very little trade value. We should stop with the ridiculous trade ideas.","Just opening friendly discussion here: many of the trades and comments centered around our players are outlandish. 

1. Theres no reason that other GMs are going to value players who cant stay on the floor and stretch the floor. Every time someone mentions that a team needs Fultz or Isaac for one of their strengths, the idea fails to mention that the Magic do not benefit from this strength because of their lack of durability. Theres no real reason for a contender to trade for these players and if they did, it would be for pennies. 

2. These players contracts make it very hard to trade for equal value without taking on bad contracts in return. 

Fultz and Isaac make ~17m each. There are very few players that make ~17m that would be traded for these players and actually contribute positively to our roster. This also makes packaging them together to get a better player difficult.

3. There isnt a realistic player on a non-contender that would fix our problems. Id love to package a bunch of players to trade for Markkanen, Murray, or Siakam, but we cannot trade for these players without trading either Banchero, Franz, Suggs, or Cole and possibly multiple 1st rounders with the last 2. Not to mention it would destroy team chemistry. 

The current pool of good players on non-contenders do not address the teams weaknesses (LaVine, Wiggins, Thybulle). This is a point that Id like to see your opinion on. I dont see a player on a non-contender that is both realistic and fills a position of need.",OrlandoMagic,110,https://www.reddit.com/r/OrlandoMagic/comments/193b3rl/fultz_isaac_chuma_and_harris_have_very_little/

I was excited to go to the game last night. Knew it was going to be a really close one. Couldve flipped a coin on who would win. 

Ive been to a lot of games as an opposing fan, across all the major sports, and I have to say, you guys are the most respectful fan base Ive come across. There was some fun playful banter, fun mutual respect, mutual admiration of jerseys, and met a lot of nice people. Yall let me do my own thing, no heckling, no verbal abuse, nothing&. Before, during, and after the game. 
Its bound to happen anywhere, but I was just absolutely surprised. I plan on going to a lot of games there, wether against the kings or games that seem like it would be competitive, and its nice to know theres a safe sports environment out there.

2024-04-11,1712830622,Some perspective on this team's and others' development,"I see a lot of people reacting really strongly in the game threads. We win 2 games in a row - Paolo is all-nba, Mosley is COTY, Suggs is DPOY and we will beat anyone but Celtics. We lose 2 games in a row - Weltman should be fired, Mosley is at best mediocre, roster is terrible and we will lose in play-ins. Guess what - teams have streches of bad games, teams have streches of good games. People thinking we are legitimate top 3/4 seed this season are overreacting, people going full doomer mode calling the roster construction terrible are overreacting. 

Here are some facts:

\- Paolo is in his 2nd year, Suggs and Franz are in their 3rd year

\- This is the 4th youngest roster in the league

\- This team won 34 games last season

\- Our preseason over/under was 37.5 wins, we are currently at 46

&amp;#x200B;

Here are some comparisons:

\- Denver with Jokic didn't make playoffs for the first **3 years**

\- Warriors with Curry didn't make playoffs for the first **3 years**

\- Wolves are finally coming together in Anthony Edwards' **4th year**

\- Mark Daigneault who will now probably win COTY won **22 and 24 games** in his first 2 seasons with Thunder, **40 games** last year and lost in play-ins.

\- Shai has made his MVP jump in his **5th year**

\- Tatum made his leap in **3rd/4th year**, Jalen Brown in his **4th/5th** year

\- Suns with Devin Booker made finals in his **6th year**, all the previous years they were out of playoffs

Teams need time. We are on the right path. But we are still a year or two from being actual playoff threat. Yes, we need to add the right pieces in the coming years but calm down. We were still half-tanking just year ago. The winning has just started.",OrlandoMagic,76,https://www.reddit.com/r/OrlandoMagic/comments/1c1bijd/some_perspective_on_this_teams_and_others/

2024-04-21,1713737112,Franz Wagner: Role Player Pretending to be a Star or a Monster Waiting to be Unleashed?,"Orlando Magic forward Franz Wagner has regressed as a 3 point shooter, straight up disappeared at times during the regular season, has only managed to increase his scoring average by 1 point, and disappointed in quarters 2 and 3 of his playoff debut. Many Magic fans have taken all of this to mean he's not meant for stardom and is far inferior to his costar Paolo Banchero. Maybe Franz isn't good enough to be a star. If he isn't, that's okay. He'd be a very valuable role player. Maybe he isn't developing and is actually regressing. Or, maybe it's quite the opposite. Maybe Franz is actually progressing towards of level of stardom not seen in Orlando in decades. Maybe he's improved in areas across the board. And maybe, just maybe, he's on a path towards the basketball hall of fame.

Has Franz actually regressed? In his first 2 seasons, he shot 35% and 36% respectively from 3. But in the 2024 season, he's dropped down to a career worst 28%. As a 3pt shooter, his attempts slightly rose from 4.5 to 4.6 attempts per game, but dropped down from 1.6 to 1.3 makes. Because of this, Franz has lost confidence as a shooter and taken less 3's off the dribble, even opting out of taking them all together on certain possessions. This has impacted his ability to drive to the basket because defenders aren't worried about his shot and can sag off of him. Because of this, Franz has seen a massive decline in driving efficiency, points in the paint, and playmaking since the defense doesn't respect him as a scorer. Or at least, he should have. 

&amp;#x200B;

[via basketball-reference.com](https://preview.redd.it/cye4k2u2ewvc1.png?width=1292&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1ae51bc1fbc4e0edb75326e8921918adc19f73aa)

Surprisingly, Franz has actually seen an improvement on his 2pt%, jumping from 54.4% to 57% and his raw FG% only dropped slightly from 48.5% to 48.2%. When a player drops from 36% from 3 to 28% on increased volume, we should see a noticeable drop in raw FG%. Yet that's not what happened. While his shot has fallen off a cliff, his driving ability has skyrocketed. Amongst all forwards, Franz ranks 6th in rim shot creation/75, 6th in rim shot making, and 4th in finishing talent behind only Giannis, Zion, and Lebron.

From 0-3 feet, Franz is shooting 71.6%, a slight drop off from his 72.8% last season, on increased volume. This season, 31.5% of his overall shots coming from 0-3 feet, a rise from 27% last season. He's also improved from 3-10 feet on more attempts as well, indicating better efficiency on his runners, floaters, hooks, and layups. In short, Franz has become a legitimate threat inside the arc among the league's best.

 

[via basketball-reference.com](https://preview.redd.it/1uko04alfwvc1.png?width=1417&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0a153dfe58061309c001c6b96d35c6c8f5f225c5)

In addition to his finishing, he's also improved as a rebounder and playmaker as well. Not only have his rebound numbers improved (4.1 to 5.3) and his assist numbers improved (3.5 to 3.7), his rebound% and assist% have improved as well. For those of you unfamiliar with what rebound% and assist% are, they are the percentage of overall assists/rebounds the team as a whole have when this player is on the floor that are directly attributed to the player. This season, 9.6% of the rebounds the grabbed when Franz was on the floor were grabbed by him, up from 7.1% a year ago. His assists% jumped from 17.2% to 18.8% as well. When it comes to playmaking talent amongst forwards, this season Franz ranked as high as 2nd behind only Lebron James himself. 

[via BBall Index](https://preview.redd.it/rz6qza93hwvc1.png?width=532&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ab95f6aff36cb3b9fddab754b63910c9a82b163f)

In his Playoff debut, Franz Wagner recorded 18 points, 7 rebounds, 3 assists, 1 steal, and 3 blocks while shooting 7/15 from the field, 2/6 from 3, and 2/4 from the free throw line with 0 turnovers. He was an overall -7 for the game. While he started out strong with 6 points in the first quarter, he struggled against the Cavs zone defense in the 2nd and 3rd quarter, only to adjust and rally in the 4th quarter for 8 points to close the game. It was a rough game, but nothing to be alarmed about. Here is Giannis' first playoff series: 

[via basketball-reference.com](https://preview.redd.it/yawg5p9uhwvc1.png?width=1277&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b647c205da72cb065f4efcff1819fec3fbbc1ee4)

First playoff series do not typically go well for young players, especially not when teams can run zone the way the Cavs did. For a playoff debut, he was fine and appeared to figure things out in the 4th quarter, which I expect will carry over into game 2.

Franz's slashing talent, playmaking talent, and overall versatility have him sitting at a borderline all star level currently while shooting 28% from 3. Once his 3 point shot is figured out and the overall spacing is better, he's projected to have a nasty leap into stardom with a ceiling I'm not sure can be measured. He's like a soda bottle that's been shaken up with a pack of mentos inside and left to build pressure. Based on his touch around the rim and free throw shooting, it is very likely Franz will become an elite shooter eventually, the question is when.

DARKO DPM tracks the daily plus-minus of players to display overall impact and career progression, as well as future projections. If we compare his DARKO DPM to similar talented slashing forwards based on age, here's how he tracks:  

[via darko.app](https://preview.redd.it/tq3yeupakwvc1.png?width=1162&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8f156fd5388271a33a857c5837633fa3e536e1c9)

If we decide to track DARKO DPM based on games rather than age, it starts to look more like this:

[via darko.app](https://preview.redd.it/z68gvp8okwvc1.png?width=1146&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1a5792c176731596f09d362e3177f1647dfa4d59)

While Franz sits in the middle of or below the trends of the others in both charts, he's estimated to be in the range of those players at this point in their careers. His projection currently has him trending more towards Giannis and Zion rather than Siakam, but it's impossible to tell where he will go. He could take a Zion-like dip or start to plateau a bit more like Siakam, or he could shoot off like Giannis. There really is not a way to say for certain.

But what happens when he treat him like a wing instead of like a guard and track him that way? If we compare him to wings of his tier: 

[via darko.app](https://preview.redd.it/pnddpf2rlwvc1.png?width=1138&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e143156787539191f1236c662ce1ae1939a0929f)

When compared to Jalen Williams, Jaylen Brown, Scottie Barnes, and Gordon Hayward, only Jalen Williams stands out as a player currently ahead of Franz at this point in their careers and only Jalen Williams is trending in a direction to be better than Franz long term. Now let's compare Franz to the elite wings of today:

[via darko.app](https://preview.redd.it/4bt9ofximwvc1.png?width=1151&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=33e5afa76a6951ad5f422f4db03dd15aa64a182d)

When compared to Paul George, Jimmy Butler, Kawhi Leonard, and Brandon Ingram, only Ingram was behind Wagner at this point in their careers. While Franz's trendline is better than the others, it's difficult to say whether he'll end up in their tier or not. The main point of showing this was to display how Franz stacks up against the elite talents as a wing vs as a forward. Of course, if Franz figures out his 3 ball next season, he'll likely throw a wrench in this data and skyrocket up, but that's an ""if"" thing.

Finally: How good does Franz project to be? If we use craftedPeakPM which projects the plus-minus of a player when they reach their prime (age 27), here's how Franz stacks up against players under 25: 

[via craftedNBA.com](https://preview.redd.it/6vfjhwhunwvc1.png?width=672&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c2afba94794721fcdf715db9eab1ed46801cf78d)

Conclusion: Franz has not regressed, he has improved across the board minus shooting and has a very high ceiling as a player. In all likelihood, he becomes an all star sooner rather than later and takes a jump into ALL NBA not long after that.

Slightly edited for readability

Zach:   
""  
This was the team I described as: ""when the line came out it was higher than I would've thought and I nodded and gave Vegas &amp; ESPN-Bet a hat tip"" cause I'm like, 'I'm glad that you believe in this team. I'm glad that you believe that this young team was a real thing.  
  
As we always say with these young teams, that development is not always linear--- like the win total don't go up in a straight line for a million different reasons, and a diagonal line with a nice slope-- But I think this team is a good regular season team, we'll see what they are in the playoffs. They will never get far in the playoffs until they develop an offense that is not one of the 10 worst offenses in the NBA.  
  
But I was very surprised to see the Orlando Magic at 47.5 wins.   The same total as the Cavs, and a bunch of other high profile western conference teams. Again, the east has a bunch of wins baked into your schedule, but that's a **fat** total, and they won 47 last year-- so you think 'oh that's where you'd set it' but sometimes with these young teams you see sort of... umm.. unexpected setbacks in their development. Like someone gets injured or someone's 3-pnt shot proves to not have been real the previous year.... contracts get into it or whatever... obviously this team added KCP who should fit this team like a glove into their starting 5.  
  
**And I** ***love*** **this starting 5,** ***give me all*** **of Jalen Suggs, KCP, Franz Wagner, Paolo Banchero, Wendell Carter JR. Off the bench? You wanna talk to me about a good NBA bench? This is one of the best benches in the NBA. Cole Anthony, Jonathan Isaac, and Mo Wagner are the 3 most important bench players and you can just fiddle around with both staggering minutes and who among the guards... whether it's a veteran like Gary Harris-- it's Anthony Black time-- is Jett Howard alive? Whats going on?? I think this team is DEEP. The defense is completely real.**

Like you look for little holes in their defense, this is the 3rd ranked defense in the NBA. And you look at-- where are all the holes gonna be? Where is the evidence that this was luck? Ok-  
  
Opponent 3pnt shooting..? No.   
Shot profile allowed? No. They allow a good shot profile, nothing outrageous.  
They do what they do really well, which is force turnover's and get rebounds and they foul a lot because they play ultra-physical. Everything about their defense checks out as what you would expect. Offensively they were 22nd which I believe is either their 12th or 13th consecutive year with a bottom 10 offense in the NBA. Truly a remarkable streak of incompetence offensively, but there's room for improvement across the board.

I'm a top 5% Jalen Suggs fan. I think Jalen Suggs is awesome, and I hope that shooting proves real. No one's working harder at it in the NBA. I'm not saying I'm like 'over over over'.. I'm just saying that if you told me even after the playoffs when, yeah they pushed Cleveland to 7, but nobody came out looking great in that series, especially not Franz Wagner. Banchero came out fine, but on the team level no one came out and was like, OK this is a rising juggernaut. 

I think this team is going to be rock solid again next year, and if you told me Fred Katz, that when we get to the end of the year you want to lock in the top 4 eastern conference playoffs seeds as Boston, New York, Philly, Milwaukee, you wanna lock those in ...OK?... lock them in and that often doesn't work out. If you told me that ORLANDO had home court in the 1st round next season over one of those teams, and over Cleveland, and over Indiana, I'd be like-- 'It's not shock.. It's not a shock' ""

Fred:  
"" They were one of my favorite teams last year and just to add to your point Zach, last year Jalen Suggs, Franz Wagner, Paolo Banchero, Wendell Carter on the court together--- Magic are +8.8. Now you're adding KCP to that mix where before it was Gary Harris. Now you're adding KCP who is perfect as a 3 &amp; D guy""

Zach:  
""He is purely additive.""

Fred:  
""One of the best players in the NBA that you can plop onto any team and he will help them on both sides of the ball without disrupting their eco-system on either side""

Zach:  
""Yeah I mean if I were a western conference championship contender with the best player in the world in my team I would ... like... KCP seems like a guy I want to have on my team.. seems like a perfect fit""

Fred:  
""Yeah but I don't know... can you trade him for Russell Westbrook? Then you might gotta do it Zach. I will say.. I'm with you. I love watching them defend, and you talk about how there is no outliers in the numbers that says it's fluke-ish in the numbers. If Jonathan Isaac can get to a place where he can just play 20 minutes.. my personal opinion.. he might just be the best defender in the eastern conference. Maybe the best per minute defender in the league other than Wemby.""

Zach:  
""I think he is.""

Fred:  
""There are times where he'll guard bigs- he's tremendous coming over from the weakside as a shot-blocker. They'll just put him on the primary assignment on just a point guard. They'll just throw him on a point guard and they'll be like.. Jonathan Isaac you're a center but you work like a wing, so just go disrupt that point guard with your insane speed and athleticism and unbelievable, never-ending length. If they can get to a place where he can play 20 minutes, and play consistently.. which I have no idea if they can because he's been so hurt for so long.. but if he can get him to that place-- that defense is better than it was last year. Not worse. Then you can get to a place where you can throw out these unbelievably long line-ups that just beat the crap out of you. They have a fantastic defensive culture.""

""Mo Wagner would try to take a charge against his own mother""

Fred goes on to praise Coach Mose and getting the players to buy in and the convo continues for another couple minutes--- but I don't have time to type out the rest.

In fact, the moment Minnesota won game 7 against Denver I knew Boston was about to win the title. So I was bewildered by all of the ""Mavs in 6"" talk when Boston was clearly the better team top to bottom with the exception of Luka. And dear god, today's closeout was insanely boring to watch. Felt like I was watching a play in game.

I'm not even a Boston (or Dallas) hater. I just feel like this should have been a sweep and the fact that Boston probably lost on purpose just to win at home made this series even more of a waste of time to watch.

2024-07-02,1719923687,This off-season has been a major success ,"I understand that Weltman's extremely patient approach has been frustrating at times, but I'm having a hard time understanding a lot of the doom and gloom I've seen spread from the fan base so far this offseason.

I think everyone's expectations may have shifted too far when it seemed like PG was a real option, but I feel we need to keep into perspective how much weve already improved.

The Gary Harris spot essentially lost us the Cavs series and we immediately upgraded it with one of the best players on the market. We locked up our deep bench by bringing back Goga and Gary on friendly contracts and we still have the space to bring in a veteran guard.

Our franchise has top 11 draft capital invested in AB and Jett. They are going to get more opportunity next year. A veteran floor-setting PG in the light of what Mike Conley has been for Minnesota on a short-term deal is what we need, and I think there is a good chance we still get it. Gary Harris at this stage in his career on that contract is not a rotation lock by any means. If Jett is what we hope he will be, he will have every chance to beat out Gary next season.

Giving runway for our stars and unproven young guys to still grow and play big roles for us was a huge priority for me, and we've accomplished that while still improving a major position of need.

One thing I've noticed lately is his 4th quarter rotations seem to be more on point. He is more willing to make adjustments down the stretch and play with different lineups.

This was evident in last nights game. Isaac subbed in with around 3:30 to go, a lineup we've seen a little bit and as fans, we love so far. However, Denver quickly went on a 5-0 run and Mosley quickly subbed Goga back in with around 2:30 to go. We went on to win the game.

Not only that, but I think he's also realized Paolo/Franz need shooting around them, especially in the 4th. Around the 2 minute mark, Gary Harris subbed in for Cole to give us that little bit of extra spacing.  


This is great to see; It has often been complained about by fans.

2024-07-20,1721463594,Franz Wagner: Orlando's Other Star,"When Franz Wagner suffered an ankle injury on January 3 @ Sacramento, the Orlando Magic would lose that game, then go on to lose 5 of their next 8 games, bringing the record to 3-6 and nearly falling out of playoff contention. When Franz Wagner returned, the Magic went 27-18 and put themselves in good position to snag the 2nd seed, only for Franz to again injure his ankle vs Chicago and miss the next 2 games. Orlando would go on to lose both those games and fall into the Play In, only for Franz to return again and help the Magic split their last 2 regular season games. If we're keeping track, that leaves the Magic at 3-8 in games Franz plays fewer than 6 minutes and 44-27 in games Franz plays 6 or more minutes. So what does this mean? Why does Franz lead the team in win shares every year, excluding his rookie season? Why do all the advanced stats favor Franz as the highest impact player on the team? And did Franz's game fail to translate to the playoffs?

Franz Wagner and Paolo Banchero have played 141 career games together and led the Magic to win improvements every season. While Paolo's midrange game, post heavy offense, footwork, and athletic dunks have entertained fans, Franz's game has flown under the radar. Because it's not as pretty to the average fan, many walk away wondering why the advanced stats point so heavily to Franz being the largest reason for Magic success. Win shares, which serves as a metric for giving credit for team wins, point to Franz contributing the most to wins.

https://preview.redd.it/dkdoigpgdmdd1.png?width=1427&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=54e79c305fcfbecb34ce27eabefa1bd107555653

Impact stats like EPM (Estimated Plus Minus) and RAPM (Regularized Adjusted Plus Minus) both place Franz not only top of the Magic, but in the Top 50 players overall. Paolo Banchero became one of few players in NBA history to lead his team in points, rebounds, assists, but what if I told you that Franz Wagner was right behind him in each of those numbers? For the 2023-2024 NBA Season, Franz Wagner ranks 2nd on the Magic in Points, Rebounds, Assists, and Steals and if it weren't for the injury placing him on minutes restriction  in January and his annual March burnout, Franz would've been right on the heels of Paolo in basic box score numbers.

https://preview.redd.it/ublgi1pzemdd1.png?width=1407&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4db15735e75a2a33301379120b6b045360b839f3

The glaring stain on his 2024 season was his dip in 3pt shooting this season where he started the year in the mid 20's, worked his averages up to 32% for the year, only to absolutely plummet in the last 3 months, leading his final 28% for the year. Many find this to be a concern and some even suggest that this negates Franz's impact, but I do not have the data to agree. His first 2 seasons served as a strong indicator of future success as a shooter and his career 85% free throw shooting suggests he has the shooter's touch. The best explanation I can provide is that this was probably tired legs from his World Cup run. Players like Tyrese Haliburton, Bodgan Bogdanovic, and Austin Reeves have also seen similar drop offs from 3 this season. Only Franz knows what happens and we will have to see what the future holds. But if prior shooting seasons, his consistency as a free throw shooter, and his touch around the rim are to be believed, he is due for a stronger year next season as a shooter.

Now, advanced stats and a shooting explanation look nice, but why wasn't Franz better in the playoffs? The current narrative for the Magic this postseason is Paolo hooped and carried the Magic to 7 games and his teammates pooped the bed. But how much of this is really true?

  
Take game 1 for example. Paolo had 24 points to kick off the postseason opener, but the Magic still lost by 14. What's forgotten is that Franz was behind Paolo with 18 points of his own, led the Magic in 4th quarter point with 10, and helped the team outscore the Cavs by 6 points while Franz was in. Unfortunately, too late. Story of the game was the Cavs blowing out the Magic in the first quarter, then cruising to an easy victory.

[Total Game Box Score](https://preview.redd.it/7qnz9gqihmdd1.png?width=1282&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4161da21b18635c95ad5c026ce527d863fd42ce6)

Game 2 kicked off a similar theme. Paolo had 21 points, the Cavs got out to an early lead, and Franz shot terribly as the Magic were once again blown out. But this game can be told in two halves. In the second half, Paolo came alive for 15 points and was by far the Magic's most impactful player on the court while Franz could only record 1 point and shot an abysmal 0/6 when the Magic needed every bucket they could find.

[2nd Half Box Score](https://preview.redd.it/h4fukqgbimdd1.png?width=1282&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=710db1da2fd544b99d973c107b5593368b0cd8f5)

Yet in the 1st half, it was actually the opposite. The Magic only recorded 44 points to the Cavs 58 and Paolo had just 6 points on 3/8 shooting. When the Magic needed points, it was Franz who recorded 17 of the Magic's 44 to barely keep them in the game. 

[1st Half Box Score](https://preview.redd.it/m9z4zmtoimdd1.png?width=1286&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8c14e082ab9099ded116b04bfe57438f2a76a3ef)

The Magic now fell down 0-2 and were headed back to Orlando for a Game 3. This is where Magic fans remember Paolo Banchero exploding for 31 points, 14 rebounds, and 5 assists while Jalen Suggs pitched in 24 points as the 2 managed to pick apart the Cavs in just 3 quarters to keep Orlando alive. Here's what they forget: Orlando started Game 3 shooting 0-8 from the field and Paolo was 0-5. The Magic could not get the lid off the basket and the Cavs were getting off to another hot start. Game 3 started out as a repeat of the 1st 2 games and the Magic were in danger of going down 0-3. That was until this happened: 

[Franz 1st Quarter Brilliance](https://reddit.com/link/1e7qt23/video/fp3ygxr7kmdd1/player)

Thanks to Franz, the lid was officially off the basket. Paolo and Jalen were able to take us home and Franz recorded 16 points to go with 8 assists and 5 rebounds in just 3 quarters.

https://preview.redd.it/bvh7q0rjkmdd1.png?width=1297&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d479c7c770029da65f14ff96d0176f2939b49ed8

This led us into Game 4. We remember Game 4 for the game Franz exploded for 34 points and 13 rebounds. Paolo saw Franz was hot, took a backseat, and the Magic coasted to another blowout victory.

https://preview.redd.it/jo9ku530lmdd1.png?width=1297&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=fe9f8f17a224aae311a0a4dc764d8590f4104a05

Except that's not what happened. Despite his best efforts, Paolo could only put up 5 points on 2/6 shooting with 4 turnovers in the first half and the Magic were down 9. Franz kept the Magic in the game again with 11 points, but all the momentum was headed in the Cavs' favor. Orlando was on the verge of falling down 3-1. Then, Franz exploded in the second half for 23 points and led a furious 3rd quarter run that had the Magic outscore the Cavs by 27(!!) points while he was in the game that quarter. For the game, the Magic outscored the Cavs by 32 points when Franz was in the game. This +/- of 32 stands as one of the largest in the entire postseason for all teams. A quiet 9 point on 4/14 performance from Paolo was able to be forgotten thanks to this explosion by Franz.

[First Half Box Score](https://preview.redd.it/30sb2faxlmdd1.png?width=1281&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a545a29e97048d8912fc52edfd765c70b3b14078)

So the series is now tied 2-2 and the Magic have figured out their formula. Let Franz open the games and Paolo close them. As long as this formula is followed, the Magic shouldn't fall that far behind in the first and won't have to worry about clawing back in the rest of the game. Unfortunately, this would be the 1st game Franz truly would poop the bed. Only being able to muster up 5 first quarter points and 14 overall on 3/11 shooting, the Magic couldn't pull ahead like they did in the previous 2 games. Up until this point, Franz had been shooting an absurd 75%(!!) when guarded by Evan Mobley and took the opportunity to drive on him in the clutch. However, this would be the game Mobley finally got revenge and blocked Franz's game typing layup to seal the game in the Cavs favor. Paolo's 39 points were wasted. 

https://preview.redd.it/yoly0bg3nmdd1.png?width=1282&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b66494264555ffa558da44e0590ab7378184456d

Headed back to Orlando for Game 6, everyone knew that this game would be a dogfight. Fortunately, the Magic were aware and followed the winning formula. Franz erupted for 14 1st quarter points while playing the shooting guard position. 

[1st Quarter Box Score](https://preview.redd.it/n9kpz1lonmdd1.png?width=1282&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2d69ab7e4f4df80901b1c843cd1aebf0c391e364)

This allowed the Magic to actually lead at the start of the game. Jalen Suggs and Paolo would soon join him on this scoring frenzy and the 3 would make history as one of only 3 trios to each score 20+ points in an elimination game while being 22 or younger. The others were Kevin Durant, Russell Westbrook, and James Harden and Kevin Durant, Russell Westbrook, and Serge Ibaka. Paolo and Franz would become the ONLY duo in NBA history to both score 25 points in an elimination game while being 22 or younger. And Paolo Banchero was able to put on a clutch masterclass to end the game and force a game 7.

[Full Game Box Score](https://preview.redd.it/1u5fv3ecomdd1.png?width=1281&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4e68a652ab77e51a8ebcb1546042ac20822540c5)

Game 7 unfortunately is the other game this series where Franz flat out pooped the bed. While no one on the Magic shot well, Franz's 1/15 performance stands as the worst game 7 shooting of all time. I wish I could show the film, but reddit only allows me to post so many media forms on a single post. I reviewed Franz's game 7 performance so many times because it just doesn't make sense to me. Was it the size that limited him? Had his shooting woes finally caught up to him? What I found was that he just really couldn't get anything to go that game. Multiple open layups were missed. Drives he normally converted on didn't fall for him. And his shot wasn't there that game. Honestly, it was a nightmare performance that can't be explained by just pointing at a flaw or 2. Yips? Who knows, but I've never seen him miss so many easy layups before. 

https://preview.redd.it/dx2odto6pmdd1.png?width=1281&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e0ab0c96c6b1922f3623d00f11e14cda3931511c

Before game 7, Franz was averaging 21 points, 7 rebounds, and 4 assists on 60% true shooting while Paolo averaged 24/7/4 on slightly worse efficiency. After game 7, Paolo's numbers went up to 27 points a game, but Franz's dropped to 19 and his efficiency PLUMMETED. 

Knowing all of this, has Franz's game been overrated by the advanced stats? Was he a playoff dropper? My conclusion: NO. Franz had roughly 2 bad games and a bad game 2 second half, but the rest of the games revealed a level of dominance that only stars can muster. There were many moments in these games where he did what great players do and took over. Sometimes his takeovers set up Paolo for finishes. Sometimes Paolo couldn't capitalize in time. Sometimes Paolo took over and set up Franz to contribute. And sometimes Franz couldn't capitalize. While his game 7 numbers skew his averages to look far worse than they were, it's important to remember that bad playoff games are common amongst stars and even moreso when the stars are 22 years old and younger. For example, here's Anthony Edwards' game 7 against the Nuggets for the first half:   


[1st half](https://preview.redd.it/h2809pztqmdd1.png?width=1285&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1628c18ef08c9c36b7a06b044415a57c6cb08de3)

And here's for the 4th quarter:

[4th quarter](https://preview.redd.it/oe841qbzqmdd1.png?width=1281&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=33f243f4780a5d078ae7263d2f84808f042e2320)

Do we say that Anthony Edwards isn't a star because he pooped the bed when it mattered most? No. Because we understand that young players have bad games. And before anyone asks, no, he did not have a dominant 3rd quarter. It was solid, but no where near enough to makeup for his pooping of the bed:

[3rd quarter](https://preview.redd.it/l54ekh9brmdd1.png?width=1283&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=fa2bd8fbdbc4c2e5c0ded697630bf8951da92506)

So, young stars have the occasional bad playoff game. Sometimes it's an important game 7. It happens. Franz's impact followed him into the playoffs and with the exception of 2 bad games and 1 bad half, he rose his game when the Magic needed him to. Where does that leave Franz Wagner's future outlook though? 

Well, if we decide to compare Franz to his peers, we see that his impact is currently ahead of theirs.

https://preview.redd.it/5h093nfurmdd1.png?width=1193&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a385331d2bba5a6d0c31805ab3e984aa1d73a039

Franz is on a very clear star trajectory. One final concern I'd like to address is his improvement. Many fans, for whatever reason, feel that Franz has regressed this season or not improved much because of his box score stats. First, let's address the elephant in the room. While his 3pt% plummeted, his FG% stayed the same, meaning that he somehow improved enough in 2pt% to offset the 3pt% drop off. And he has. This season, he shot 57% (!!) from 2pt range, mainly on rim finishes, without being a post scorer. Doing this mainly on drives is honestly astounding, but I'm out of media that I'm allowed to use on this post, so I can't display comparisons. He's had a career year in points, rebounds, assists, and steals WHILE the Magic DROPPED in pace. That's right, Orlando is actually playing at a slower pace than in prior seasons, meaning he has less possessions this year than he did last year. 

If we use per 75 possessions (the average number of possessions stars play in today's game), Franz's season stats become:

2022: 17.85 ppg / 5.3 rpg / 3.45 apg

2023: 20.63 ppg / 4.8 rpg / 3.9 apg

2024: 22.58 ppg / 6.08 rpg / 4.28 apg

These are the number Franz puts up on most other teams that play at average NBA pace. If he played on a team like the Pacers, these numbers would likely be even higher due to their extremely fast pace. But when adjust for pace, it's easier to see the growth in basic box score stats that fans wanted to see so badly. And yes, this also means that if the Magic had played at last year's stats, Paolo probably would've averaged closer to 25 ppg. That's how much pace can effect box scores.

Franz is Orlando's 2nd star and he did show up when the Magic needed him, even if the ending to what was otherwise an amazing postseason left a sour taste people's mouths.

We still go through these infuriating droughts where the ball sticks and it becomes clunky, but in this game at least, our defense forced the same ice-cold scoring on them.  

We have to maintain our defensive intensity because we simply don't have the weapons to keep up a shootout with them.  However, if we do it and Paolo has a bounce-back game in Cleveland, we can very easily be heading back home to close it out.",OrlandoMagic,35,https://www.reddit.com/r/OrlandoMagic/comments/1cf7pej/game_4_is_exactly_what_we_needed/

2024-06-06,1717689976,Orlando Magic Rebrand information @OmarMagic12,"Hey guys, I saw the thread yesterday and wanted to clear up the information. 

Q The Orlando Magic are working towards a rebrand with a modern take on the classic jerseys. 

Q They have been working on it since 2021 and I originally heard it was meant to launch for the 2024-25 season. Now, I am hearing that it may potentially be pushed to 2025-26 which I believe would be a massive mistake and let down. 

Q Yes, I think the number font should be classic, but I think the team will likely keep the old font since they used it on Shaqs jersey banner.

Q I believe the ball logo will stay since they've invested in placing it everywhere, including the new training center. The blocky modern text will not be used. 

Q The rebrand has been in the works since 2021 and I believe the jersey designs over the last few years have been testing the waters. The team is listening to the fans.

Q This design is my own prediction. 5{555 55 5u5v5{ 5 5555 55 555 555555.

2024-07-02,1719937239,The Jalen Suggs disrespect has to stop ,"I get that people are upset that it's shaping up for Suggs to be our starting point guard again, but I'm legitimately seeing people say that he needs to be coming off the bench in favor of Tyus freaking Jones and is not a starter, as if he didn't just make an all-defensive team and shoot 39% from three on high volume. He's also shown the ability to make sizable improvements in his game year over year.

To me, the front office is making a fair bet. It's a bet on Franz/Paolo continuing to take steps forward as playmakers on this team. That's the only reason this works. Suggs has the title of point guard, but he will never have the responsibilities of one in this offense.

We saw enough last year to continue with this experiment for one more year imo. The more reps Franz/Paolo get, the better off we will be in the long term. Suggs is awesome, and I genuinely think there's going to be real internal development next year that's going to shock people.",OrlandoMagic,122,https://www.reddit.com/r/OrlandoMagic/comments/1dtpvhh/the_jalen_suggs_disrespect_has_to_stop/

Yes, today was one of the worst chokes of the playoffs. Franz had an absolutely atrocious game. JI sucked. Suggs sucked. Everyone outside of Paolo was complete ass. 

But I'm not that disappointed. We were the best defense in the league. Paolo was a first time all star. Then we competed for home court advantage and went to 7 games against a (relatively) seasoned playoff team. 

Most important is that we found our identity again. And after 11 years of horrific basketball thats about as much as I could ask for personally.

We should have won this series. But this team is still learning how to win. The important thing is that we're getting better at it. Much, much better at it.
