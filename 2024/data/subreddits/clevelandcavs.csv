2024-06-27,1719456623,My Dream has been crushed,"I had a dream last night. The Cavs are trading up for the 26th pick. It seems to be taking them a good amount of time to pick; its honestly strange. Finally after a lot of time I see Adam silver walking up to the stage with the envelope. All of a sudden someone rushes onto the stage and pushes Adam silver out of the way. ITS JIMMY HASLAM! Hes says Ill take it from here Adam. He takes out the big envelope and looks out into the crowd. He points to Myles and smiles. He then gets out the envelope and throws it to the side. He says with a bright smile& Bronny, welcome to Cleveland. All of a sudden the crowd erupts and Lebron comes sprinting onto the stage and screams Clevelanddddd this is for you!.
Then Kenny Atkinson hands him the contract and he signs for 1 million a year. Then bronny comes up daps up Lebron and Jimmy; they both scream Cleveland Im coming home. Then the Cavs that year win the championship with Darius Garland and Jarret Allen skipping in the flower field!",clevelandcavs,12,https://www.reddit.com/r/clevelandcavs/comments/1dpgw7b/my_dream_has_been_crushed/

2023-11-14,1699972195,Garland and Mitchells chemistry,"Is non-existent. Waited all last year to see a glimpse of them being able to play together, understood it takes time to mesh, kept waiting, never saw it. And this year looks even worse somehow, just two dudes trading off pounding the ball then forcing a drive or 3 point heave. Its now safe to say these guys are not a good combination together, and never will be. 
  
Garland and Mobley are our future, I dont care what anyone says about Garland he is a legitimate rare point guard who can facilitate and score even if he has serious flaws in defending and clutch scoring. I think he needs a Klay type of SG who doesnt need the ball in his hands at all times to be effective like Mitchell. He needs a dude that moves off ball, ready and happy to catch and shoot, happy to pass back to Garland instead of hunting a score every time the ball touches his hands, and can defend at a respectable level. I dont blame the FO for taking a chance on Mitchell, it was worth a try because a scoring talent like him isnt coming to Cleveland for fun. But sometimes talents dont mesh well and this is one of those times.
  
At this point Im just riding out the year hoping the FO can get something back from Mitchell before he simply dips out because if we dont and we gave up the future for a rental of a high volume scorer that won us a bunch of regular season games by shooting 30 times a night but completely stuffed the growth and development of our two young cornerstone players, this will go down as an all-time mistake.",clevelandcavs,156,https://www.reddit.com/r/clevelandcavs/comments/17v3f45/garland_and_mitchells_chemistry/

2024-08-02,1722558342,Donovan Mitchell has progressed past the need for a point guard.,"Included are some Donovan Mitchell playmaking highlights from last season.

Since he came into the league, Donovan Mitchell has remained one of the best SGs in the league, and has always had a point guard next to him. Ricky Rubio, Mike Conley, and now Darius Garland have filled that role, as although Mitchell is very high usage guard, hes a score-first type of player and was quite turnover prone earlier into his career.

Last season, however, he averaged 6.1 APG, the highest of his career, with only 2.8 TO per game. Most notably, in the 15 game stretch following Darius Garlands jaw injury, he averaged 7.9 APG on 2.9 TPG. 

The point of all this? Donovan Mitchell has progressed past the need for a point guard.

[Rusty Buckets](https://youtu.be/RuFFEXMHZUY?si=OzKZsqtH5utuz2CJ) made a very good video about the death of the power forward position, and in that video he theorized that the shooting guard position is next. High usage guards who dont provide much other than scoring are becoming more and more rare, and the reason is a lot of them became point guards. After CP3s departure, James Harden became a point guard. Jamal Murray was drafted as a shooting guard, but eventually moved to PG. Even Devin Booker ran point guard for the Suns last season, and while that didnt end well, his playmaking still improved dramatically for someone whos never played PG. Skilled isolation creators with good passing skills can and tend to make the transition from SG to PG, and Donovan Mitchell has shown that he can make that transition.

This isnt to say DG needs to be traded, or that the fit wont work. But if your hang up for moving DG is DM still needs a point guard, I wouldnt be too worried about that. It may not be pretty at first, and hell definitely have to get used to being a primary playmaker, but its clear to me that Mitchell can handle running an offense without a playmaker next to him. It might also help with the size problem, as although Mitchell has improved as a defender from his Utah days, hes still an undersized guard, and Garland definitely does not help with that.

TL;DR: Donovan Mitchell CAN be a point guard.

2024-07-21,1721534713,Mobley makes this team work,"A lot of people (casuals) complaining about this Mobley extension. I personally find it hilarious and pretty ignorant. He, along with Don, is basically the reason this team has remained competitive with its current build. Yes he hasnt been allowed the touches etc to develop fully on O, but hes still improved in basically every area on that end. His defensive prowess however, is insanely important for this team which has a small back court that is not very good defensively and for the most part undersized wings. Mobleys ability to switch, defend multiple players in one possession and also defend down low is seen very rarely in young big men and has been arguably the main factor (along with Don being Don) in this team not getting killed every time it plays the leagues best teams. 

At 23 years old he is ABSOLUTELY worth what we paid him, all the signs with him have been positive and his play is priceless in our current team.

2024-09-07,1725693190,It was always coming to this. Not sure what you were expecting.,"When the Cavs swung the deal they did for Donovan Mitchell, they made a statement that they had arrived. They established their core talent: Mitchell, Garland, Mobley, Allen. Levert, Okoro, and Strus are effective if inconsistent role players. Tyson, CPJ, Bates, and Travers are an intriguing batch of kids to acquire with a late mid 1st round pick and 49th overall. 

It seems like everyone is waiting for the other shoe to drop now. Whereas on day one, this core 4 looked like a force to be reckoned with that would only get better with time. 

Guys, there are no major reinforcements coming. The concern Im sure comes from the fact that the conference has gotten a lot better and Garland/Mobley looked inconsistent last year due to both injuries and spotty performance. 

But Altman isnt aborting now. The commitment financially this offseason says it all: Altman believes both Mobley and Garland are due for major progression and still on course to unlock their immense latent potential. 

Some fans wanted to see a breakup of the core 4. The Cavs did the opposite. And Ive felt both ways. But I think they did the right thing. Theyve got their guys. Its not the time to compromise. Now is the time to believe: Mitchell is scraping Top 10 ability. JA is an all star center and defensive anchor. Now its time: Can Garland ascend to Mitchells level? Can Evan truly evolve into a Giannis or Garnett like force on both ends? Its way too early to quit on these guys. The potential is real and staying the course with this core is going to prove to be much much sexier when the offseason chatter doesnt matter anymore.

2024-08-09,1723187945,"Why I'll remember LeBron as a Cavalier, and as an American.","I'll keep this short and sweet/

I was 8 years old when the US Men's Olympic Basketball team succumbed to a Bronze medal in 2004. LeBron James was at this point a phenom, whose talent went underutilized on a team that severely underperformed. 

In the following years, LeBron took the Cavs to the heights of the NBA. While never winning it all in his first stint, the man's ability was only out-matched by his determination as he took teams that had no business being in the playoffs to the ECF and beyond. 

In 2008, we all saw what that determination could accomplish as LeBron (along with Kobe) lead the US men's team to redemption through an amazing olympics. I stayed up late with my Dad in Chicago watching Bron and Kobe carry our country to the promised land.

As a Bulls fan, I hated the Miami years. But in 2012 I put that hate aside to watch in awe as LeBron carried our country to another Gold Medal. 

It was in this summer I got to put away my cynicism and simply cheer for an amazing basketball player.

After 2012, Bron eventually returned to Cleveland. But he was different. His intensity and motor had changed. His goal was focused on bringing home a championship for y'all. For the Land. 

The intensity I saw from him in these Cleveland years mimic only his Olympic self. 2016 speaks for itself, but I believe that the only time we've seen LeBron care as much about a game as he did in those Finals/playoff games throughout the second Cleveland stint was during his olympic runs.

Now, twenty years since his first olympics, the man continues to define basketball, passion, and what it means to be a champion.

I guess I'm writing this here because I know a lot of you know better than anyone what kind of person and athlete we've witnessed. 

I wanted to take the time to say I've witnessed it too. And the greatest of moment I've witnessed have been when he was either wearing your jersey, or wearing the jersey that represents our shared country.

All this to say, cheers to LeBron, the Cavs, and Team USA.",clevelandcavs,28,https://www.reddit.com/r/clevelandcavs/comments/1enthvp/why_ill_remember_lebron_as_a_cavalier_and_as_an/

2024-06-28,1719593280,Okoro on ESPN's list of 7 most underrated free agents ,"Okoro, still just 23 years old, took a significant step forward this season within the Cavs' offense, logging career-highs in three-pointers made and three-point percentage. He also shot a career-high 40% from the corners.

These are important improvements, considering Okoro is already a plus defender. The Cavaliers gave up just 105.6 points per 100 possessions with Okoro on the court -- the best rate on the team -- and were a whopping 6.3 points worse per 100 possessions whenever he was off the floor. He's a restricted free agent, meaning Cleveland can opt to match whatever free-agent offer he gets from another team.

2023-12-10,1702221152,"Offseason Talking Point Check-In: ""We want to play faster.""","Thought it would be fun to check-in on a few of the improvement items the team focused on last offseason/this preseason and determine if we've seen any real improvement. Might make this a series if anyone cares.

First up: ""We want to play faster.""

Last season, the Cavs were slow. Like super, insanely slow, and as a result had the fewest possessions/game in the league. (The fact that the Cavs were 8th in total offensive rating is kind of miraculous in retrospect.)

TL;DR Yes, the team is playing faster and getting more fast break opportunities, which have led to more fast break points. However, the team's overall offensive rating has gone down due to a poor halfcourt offensive rating.

\-----------------------------------------------

So, how's it going so far?

||2022-23|2023-24|
|:-|:-|:-|
|Pace (# of possessions/game)|96.27 (30th)|**99.60 (17th)**|
|Transition frequency|15.5% (23rd)|**17.5 (10th)**|
|Fast break points/game|12.7 (24th)|**15.3 (9th)**|
|Transition: points per possession|**1.18 (3rd)**|1.14 (10th)|
|Percentage of points as fast-break points|11.3% (21st)|**13.8% (5th)**|
|Opponent offensive rebound percentage|28.5% (20th)|**29.5% (19th)**|

^((source for above is NBA.com))

Major takeaways: Yes! They're running more and generally are getting more possessions per game! Obviously, offensive rating in transition is way higher (league average is 126.2 vs 97.4 in the halfcourt), so if they're running more, then the overall team offensive rating should be way up, right?

Uh, yeah, about that...

||2022-23|2023-24|
|:-|:-|:-|
|Transition offensive rating|131.9 (4th)|**134.4 (5th)**|
|Halfcourt offensive rating|**99.8 (10th)**|94.8 (23rd)|
|Total offensive rating|**116.7 (7th)**|112.1 (23rd)|

^((source for above is Cleaning the Glass))

Ok, so the Cavs have been running more and been a little more efficient in transition, but their halfcourt offense has been bad, like really bad.

I'll get to the halfcourt offense in a subsequent post (maybe), but one thing caught my eye:

||2022-23|2023-24|
|:-|:-|:-|
|Transition: points per possession|**1.18 (3rd)**|1.14 (10th)|

NBA's stats for transition eFG%, transition FT frequency, and transition shooting foul frequency are all almost identical from 22-23 to 23-24, so what accounts for this slight drop in PPP?

&amp;#x200B;

||2022-23|2023-24|
|:-|:-|:-|
|Transition: scoring frequency|**54.8% (2nd)**|51.1% (15th)|
|Transition: turnover frequency|**11.1% (11th)**|14.5% (27th)|

Ah, damn you turnovers. Once/if the team stops turning the ball over less on fast breaks, that should juice the team's overall offensive rating.

For funsies, the worst offenders for transition turnover percentage appear to be:

||2023-24 (these numbers are all marked increases from last year, but I'm tired of typing at this point)|
|:-|:-|
|Isaac Okoro|21.2% (!)|
|Darius Garland|19.4%|
|Craig Porter Jr.|17.6%|
|Evan Mobley|16.2%|
|Caris LeVert|14.9%|

While these numbers individually aren't downright horrific, when basically all of your primary ballhandlers not named Max Strus or Donovan Mitchell are turning the ball over close to 20% of the time, it's going to bring down your transition numbers.

Way longer than I intended. So yeah, playing faster and getting more fast break opportunities have led to more total fast break points, but the team's overall offensive rating has gone way down due to some, ahem, *issues* in the halfcourt.

I know fans are pretty down on DG and he may never play for the Cavs again but I found this information interesting and thought Id share. Im not trying to make excuses for him, some of his struggles were more mental than physical and he shouldve been better in the playoffs. I hate seeing how many fans have turned on DG whos a great kid and was huge in getting us out of the rebuild and I will be giving him the benefit of the doubt. 

Highlights
- Broken jaw ¡ weaker teeth clenching ¡ weaker in general
- drop in production is clearly correlated to the injury (not playing with Donovan).
- similar to Tatum having a bad 4 months after he got long COVID.
- Just because most of the weight is back doesnt mean his strength is back.

Not only did we not show interest in winning the division yesterday, BUT one of the hot giveaways for fan appreciation was this dollar off coupon for Smucker's Uncrustables sandwiches. A man came to my row with a special envelop labelled with our section number. A gift so beholden that it must remain secretly tucked away in postage until being handed directly to the lucky winners. I can't wait to take these savings straight back to Rocket Mortgage Fieldhouse to watch a team opt out of winning their division. I know division titles don't mean anything, but winning the Central while Giannis is still at his peak would've been wild to me (especially after how March went).

Are Uncrustables tasty? Sure. Can I get an entire box of Uncrustables cheaper than any food item in Rocket Mortgage Fieldhouse without my sweet dollar off coupon? Absolutely. For sake of conversation, let me know how you intend to spend your Uncrustables coupon. Will you be getting:

* Peanut Butter and Grape Jelly Sandwich
* Peanut Butter and Strawberry Jam Sandwich
* Chocolate Flavored Hazlenut Spread Sandwich
* Peanut Butter and Honey Spread Sandwich
* Perhaps the wheat version of Peanut Butter and Grape Jelly or Peanut Butter and Strwaberry Jam?

I'll be watching the boys begin their playoff journey while housing some Peanut Butter and Strawberry Jam Uncrustables. Go Cavs.

Most of you called that a doomer take, but what you never understood was that there was no single game, trend, or seeding that would have changed that. 

The loss to the Knicks in 23 was historically bad. 

Its hard to put into words how inept our performance was and how lost our players were on the court. 

Ive never quite seen anything like it, honestly. Two guards at the level of DG and Mitchell completely out of ideas on the court in the middle of a first round series. 

Im not sure what people didnt see at that time that they are finally starting to see now. 

It was crystal clear in that series that Mitchell had no faith in JB. If you need to hear him say that publicly to believe it then Im not sure what to tell you.

The good news is the roster is still quite good. With a competent offensive scheme that the players actually believe in, the Cavs can still be fun.",clevelandcavs,134,https://www.reddit.com/r/clevelandcavs/comments/1bz9wst/the_big_picture_hasnt_changed/

2024-04-11,1712801980,"The state of tiebreakers, seeding","Good W for the Cavs today.  Wanted to offer some insight on tiebreakers for people who are watching the action in the rest of the league.

In other action, while I wrote this the Bucks beat the Magic and the Mavs beat the Heat, narrowing the possibilities.

Overall tiebreakers:    

* With Knicks we lose - lost H2H
* With Bucks  ~~still TBD~~ we win - tied H2H.  If we manage to tie them in record, we have the better division record and would win the division.  Thanks /u/SkaakS 
* With Magic we lose - tied H2H and they likely win their division.  If they lose their division, it means they lose out and can't tie us for record anyhow.
* Pacers ~~TBD~~ we lose - if they tie us for record, they own the division record, but the only way they can tie us for record is with a win on Friday that gives them H2H as well.

EDIT 2! Shoutout to /u/Jazzlike-Wishbone902 who pointed out that the tiebreaker rules for a 3-team tie are different than for a 2 team.  In the case of a three team tie, division winner win's the tie!  This affects us positively for an additional 2-seed scenario.  It doesn't change the tiebreaker potentials for the Magic, since they own the tiebreaker against us anyhow: https://www.sportingnews.com/us/nba/news/nba-tiebreakers-playoff-standings-play-seeding/18934dfdba44ddcbc360b482

&gt;Tiebreaker Basis  Three or More Teams Tied

&gt;(1) Division leader wins tie from team not leading a division (this criterion is applied regardless of whether the tied teams are in the same division)

NOTE: In all the scenarios below, the stuff that **has to happen is in bold**.  I'm pretty sure this is all correct, but feel free to point out any mistakes!

***Scenarios for Cavs Finish 2-0***

2 seed - ~~1~~2 possibilit~~y~~ies

* Scenario 1 - **Knicks finish 1-2 or worse**, **Bucks finish 0-2**, Magic finish any finish where they beat the Bucks, Pacers any finish. Cavs 2, Bucks 3, Knicks 4.  We win the tiebreak with the Bucks, Knicks drop in the standing and might even end up tied with the Magic.
* EDIT - Scenario 2 - **Bucks finish 0-2, Knicks finish 2-1**, Magic any finish where they beat the Bucks, Pacers any finish.  Cavs at 2, Bucks at 3, Knicks at 4.  We win the 3-way tie by winning the division (see edit above), Knicks lose the H2H tiebreak to the Bucks to drop to 4.

- Dean Wade is a better defender on derozan than strus. Why isnt he in?

- we are in ot2, why isnt he subbing anyone in? Our guys are gassed

- why were the last 5 possessions of regular period all iso shots when moving the ball is our bread and better? How are you going to let them do that?

- how arent you going to coach them up before the final ot1 possession to not foul on threes?

Strus has gotten cooked by derozan yet again in the time I wrote this. Still no adjustments. 4+ minutes into ot2 and now you sub guys in. 

And now he threw JA under the bus in the post game conference. 

The Cleveland media soft and not grilling him harder.

2024-02-12,1707759729,Cavs #3 in NBA Power Rankings,"https://www.nba.com/news/power-rankings-2023-24-week-17

NBA points:

* Theyve had their entire starting lineup for six of their last seven games, but the lineup averaged just 10.6 minutes per game over those six, down from 13.2 per game prior to the extended absences of Darius Garland and Evan Mobley, whove both averaged less than 26 minutes since their returns.
* Staggering has worked, as the Cavs have been ridiculously good when Donovan Mitchell and Jarrett Allen have been on the floor without Garland or Mobley (plus-21.0 points per 100 possessions in 89 minutes) and when Garland and Mobley have been on the floor without Mitchell or Allen (plus-23.9 in 61 minutes) over the five straight games when all five have been available. The defense has been particularly good (94.6 allowed per 100) in those 150 total minutes.

ESPN: The Cavs are winners of nine in a row and 17 of their past 18 games and arguably the hottest team in the league. Cleveland is still searching for its first playoff series win without LeBron since 1993, but with a defense that ranks second and Donovan Mitchell playing even better than last season, the Cavs have the makeup of a contender in the East.",clevelandcavs,22,https://www.reddit.com/r/clevelandcavs/comments/1ap5u3u/cavs_3_in_nba_power_rankings/

2024-04-13,1712991170,Updated State of Tiebreakers and Seeding!,"Another great W for the Cavs today, winning what felt like playoff basketball against a desperate Pacers team. Here's the (now much simpler) scenarios for the upcoming last day of NBA action.

In other action today, the Bucks lost, the Knicks won, The Sixers beat the Magic, the Heat won, the Bulls won, the Hawks lost.

#OUR TIEBREAKERS

We can now only tie the Bucks and the Knicks.

* With Knicks we lose - lost H2H unless it's a 3-way tie, then we win as division winners
* With Bucks we win - tied H2H, so we win on division record and take the Central Division title. 

As far as below us, to determine who we play, 5-8 is still somewhat up for grabs:

#OTHER TIEBREAKERS

Magic:

* Magic lose to Heat on H2H
* Magic lose to Sixers on H2H, but Magic beat Sixers in a 3-way tie as Division winners, as long as the Heat aren't part of that tie to take the division from them 
* Magic beat the Pacers on H2H or in the case of a 3-way tie that doesn't involve the Heat

Pacers:

* Lose to Magic (see above)
* Pacers beat the Heat H2H, lose to Heat if everyone ends up tied and Division winners matter
* Pacers beat the Sixers H2H

Sixers:

* Beat Magic on H2H, lose if Division winner matters
* Lose to Pacers H2H
* Tie Heat H2H, lose if Heat take the division, and if they end up tied for record, also tie for conference record.  So then it's down to conference record against playoff teams, which the Sixers win (I think?  This is the only I can't find a definitive judgment on)

#TOP SEED SCENARIOS FOR SUNDAY

So how will it all end up?  Let's look at playoff seeds 2, 3, and 4 first. We'll start on the losing, but easy side:

Cavs lose AND    

* Bucks lose, Knicks lose - Bucks 2, Knicks 3, Cavs 4
* Bucks lose, Knicks win - Knicks 2, Bucks 3, Cavs 4
* Bucks win, Knicks win - Bucks 2, Knicks 3, Cavs 4
* Bucks win, Knicks lose - Bucks 2, Knicks 3, Cavs 4

So we're the 4, and who cares about above us, they can sort it out in the semi-final on that side of the bracket if they both get there.

Now the complex side:

Cavs win AND  

* Bucks lose, Knicks lose - Cavs are 2 seed, win the central over the Bucks, win the 3-way tiebreaker to take the top seed, then Bucks take H2H tiebreaker for the 3 seed over the Knicks at 4.
* Bucks lose, Knicks win - Cavs are the 3 seed, win the central over the Bucks who are 4, Knicks are 2
* Bucks win, Knicks win - Cavs are the 4 seed with 4th best record, no tiebreaks needed.  Bucks are 2, Knicks 3.
* Bucks win, Knicks lose - Cavs are the 4 seed, lose the H2H tiebreak to the Knicks who are 3, Bucks 2.

So in 6/8 of the scenarios we are the 4 seed, 1/8 we are the 3, 1/8 we are the 2 seed.  Of course, all scenarios aren't created equal and games aren't random chance.  I think anything that includes ""Bucks lose"" is much more likely above, because of what we'll see below (and Giannis being out).

Now, who might we play?  Let's look at possibilities.  

#LOWER SEED SCENARIOS FOR SUNDAY

None of the 5-8 seeds are playing each other, so all results are just independent games.

Magic 5, Pacers 6, Sixers 7, Heat 8 if:    

* Magic W, Pacers W, Sixers W, Heat W 
* Magic W, Pacers W, Sixers W, Heat L
* Magic W, Pacers W, Sixers L, Heat W
* Magic W, Pacers W, Sixers L, Heat L
* Magic W, Pacers L, Sixers L, Heat W
* Magic W, Pacers L, Sixers L, Heat L
* Magic L, Pacers L, Sixers L, Heat L

As you can see, this is the most likely scenario (7/16 possibilities), playing the Magic if we have the 4 seed.

Pacers 5, Magic 6, Sixers 7, Heat 8 if:    

* Magic L, Pacers W, Sixers L, Heat L

Pacers 5, Sixers 6, Magic 7, Heat 8 if:

* Magic L, Pacers W, Sixers W, Heat L

Pacers 5, Sixers 6, Heat 7, Magic 8 if:    

* Magic L, Pacers W, Sixers W, Heat W

Pacers 5, Heat 6, Sixers 7, Magic 8 if:    

* Magic L, Pacers W, Sixers L, Heat W

So 2nd most likely is Pacers at 5 (4/16 scenarios) if we do indeed get our most likely result, the 4 seed.

Sixers 5, Magic 6, Pacers 7, Heat 8 if:     

* Magic W, Pacers L, Sixers W, Heat W 
* Magic W, Pacers L, Sixers W, Heat L
* Magic L, Pacers L, Sixers W, Heat L

Sixers 5, Heat 6, Magic 7, Pacers 8 if:     

* Magic L, Pacers L, Sixers W, Heat W

Sixers land the 5 seed in 4/16 of the scenarios too, including that last one where the whole play-in matchup flips on the final day of the season.

Heat 5, Pacers 6, Magic 7, Sixers 8 if:    

* Magic L, Pacers L, Sixers L, Heat W

Heat take the 5 seed 1/16th of the time, only if everything goes right for a 4-way tie. I'm only like 70% sure I got this right in how it would be evaluated.

Personally, if I'm the Cavs, I go hard to beat the Hornets.  I think the Magic are likely to play incredibly hard against the Bucks so they can lock up that 5 seed, and the Pacers are very heavily favored over the Hawks to play hard and stay out of the play-in.  If we win and the Magic win, we are most likely to get the 3 seed for a rematch of today's game, but for a whole series with the Pacers.

The danger is of course jumping to the 2 seed to play the Sixers if the Knicks and Bucks lose, who may well be coming off of 8 straight victories into the playoffs (9 if they win the play-in game too), or the Heat who are always dangerous.  But I think you roll the dice on that, and assume the Knicks aren't going to throw the game against the Bulls and risk dropping to the 4 to be on Boston's side of the playoff bracket.

Honestly, a shit load of moving pieces, and there's always weirdness on the final day of the season.  Gonna be exciting!  Go Cavs!",clevelandcavs,21,https://www.reddit.com/r/clevelandcavs/comments/1c2vqrw/updated_state_of_tiebreakers_and_seeding/

2024-04-16,1713225904,ESPN Prediction: The Cavs will take down the Magic in six games or fewer,"The squad needs to come out and make sure of it for a strong 48 minutes from game 1 and on. Ready for playoffs!

Heres more from [the ESPN post](https://www.espn.com/nba/story/_/id/39914912/nba-playoffs-2024-all-20-teams-vying-championship):

The Cavs will take down the Magic in six games or fewer. The Magic had an excellent season behind tough defense and relying on Paolo Banchero to provide the offense. In the playoffs, though, the Cavaliers have more scoring from the perimeter in addition to their defensive big men. I think Mitchell will prove healthy enough to play at his All-Star level, and he and Garland will be too much for the Magic to overcome.

For Orlando - What to watch in the first round:

Banchero's offensive possessions against Evan Mobley will be fascinating to watch and could go a long way in deciding who wins the series. Banchero rapidly developed this season as a scorer and passer and proved he has the potential to become an offensive superstar. He'll need to be great for Orlando to avoid scoring lulls.

22-23:

Were currently &lt;60% of the way through the season, and 75 3pm at this point has the pace to hit 127 3pm this year, so all of Strus, Niang and Merrill are on pace to easily hit that mark, while LeVert is barely behind his own pace from last year

2023-11-22,1700666444,The Anti-Mitchell takes are silly (we can support these players better),"We beat the Nuggets and then beat the 76ers by one and everyone gets a little overzealous with their takes.  Slow down everyone!

First off its great to see Garland and Allen playing healthy.  Im glad everyone is reminded of how effective and clutch Allen is.  His game doesnt stuff the stat box, but he gets key rebounds, gets key dunks, and fights on every possession.  Hes really valuable.

To the point of this post though, yesterdays game would have been a blow out with Donovan Mitchell.  The best thing about Donovans game is he can just go get a damn bucket when everything slows down and defenses get really physical.  Darius Garland, who is a treasure of a player and everyone adores to watch him because hes so damn cool, struggles with this.  He kind of always has.  He gets beat up, he cant get the ball back with any space.  Last night we got bailed out by him shooting a really nice, ugly, Hail Mary 3 and the giant cajones of Craig Porter Jr.  Without those two plays we lose.  With Donovan Mitchell in that game, we have someone whos going to create space for a clutch 3 or get a clutch foul call and keep our scoring up.  Please stop looking for reasons to be against this guy who weve given MVP chants for the last year.  Hes a walking bucket, hes committed on defense, and he supports the team too.  Donovan Mitchell will be critical in playoff basketball for this reason too - playoff basketball is half court scoring, defense and the ability to go get a damn bucket when you need it.  Donovan Mitchell last year had the 37th highest effective FG%.  Doesnt sound amazing right?  The only guards with volume better than him were Steph, Halliburton and Kyrie.  Same goes for TS% - guards in his range are Steph, Halli, Kyrie, SGA and Lillard.  Its not as pretty to have a guy who just goes and gets efficient buckets but its so valuable.  By the way, who got the game winning bucket in game 1?

These are great guys.  Great personalities, great players.  Lets celebrate that without tearing anyone down.  And criticize too in a healthy way - Evan Mobley cant be going 2/8 on post plays for example.  Hes immediately stepped up that part of his game this season and his efficiency is going way up!  Awesome!

 I was at game 1 this year.  DMs favorite moment last year in the whole season in an interview was Isaac Okoros game winning shot.  The guy scored 71 and thats his favorite moment.  Hes with us (at least for now) and hes part of this team.  Hes an important key player who arguably should have been 1st team all nba last year.

We have already had so many fun moments this year.  It is extremely impressive were 8-6 with injuries alllll the time.  Lets be patient about that, let our guys come back healthy and supported.  Its looking like 1-10 on our roster are really solid.  We love Max Strus, Levert has been balling, Okoro has had great energy and were so excited about Craig Porter Jr!  George Niang has started shooting better!

 Lets keep the energy high, keep the support high and LET EM KNOW.  We can easily be the best fans in the NBA.  Lets get this dub against the Heat tonight!",clevelandcavs,62,https://www.reddit.com/r/clevelandcavs/comments/181bi1f/the_antimitchell_takes_are_silly_we_can_support/

2. Lebron is scouting the roster. DG is gonna be around, hes a klutch guy. Donovan Mitchell is out. Coaching staff gone. Reddick is gonna turn down Lakers to coach the Cavs &amp; keep the podcast in person. First player coach podcast ever.

3. Bryce will carry SVSM far &amp; potentially end up with Bronny.

2023-11-12,1699815582,I read Carlos Boozer's memoir so that you don't have to,"To be clear, I borrowed this book from the library so Booz is not getting my money.

But I know Cavs fans from this era will enjoy some of the tidbits in this book.

**Boozers Rookie Year**

* The Knicks made a draft day promise to get him at #36, but the Cavs swooped in at #32
* Boozer met his new agent, Rob Pelinka, through Deshawn Stevenson, proving that Deshawn actually was the Lebron Stopper
* Booz felt John Lucas was the one who believed in him and led to him landing in Cleveland and loved playing for the guy
* He realized halfway through his rookie year that the coaches were intentionally sitting Z and Ricky Davis for key stretches to secure the tank
* He claims that during the famous practice interview where he said of Lebron we have multiple guys at that position who are better than he is right now that he was sitting right next to those guys and he was saying it in order to not disrespect his teammates and their growth as players

**Lebrons Rookie Year (Boozers Second Year)**

* During his first Cavs practice, Lebron jumped from outside the paint and OVER Milt Palacio for a dunk
* It was instantly clear during the first practice that Lebron was the best player on the team, the most skilled, and the most athletic
* Rookie Lebron was already a computer and a human rolodex and the highest IQ player Booz had ever encountered
* Lebron brought Krispy Kremes to the locker room before each home game during his rookie year

**Rookie Lebron Learning to Lead**

* Booz claims that he boldly approached Lebron at the midseason mark after a terrible loss and said When are you going to step up and take over?
* I got you Booz, Lebron said, with an uncharacteristically stern expression that told me wed gotten through. He turned to the rest of the team. Ive got all of you.
* Apparently the players felt Lebron had been too deferential and that he took off like a rocket ship after this moment. Booz thinks if this intervention happened sooner they would have surely made the playoffs.

**Boozers Infamous Contract Negotiation**

* \*Im summarizing the book here, not endorsing Boozers side of the story
* After the season Booz sat down in person with owner Gordon Gund, GM Jim Paxson, his agent Rob Pelinka, and his wife CeCe.
* The franchise had the right to pick up my $695,000 third year option, but we discussed an alternative where theyd allow me to become a free agent so the franchise could offer me a clean-slate contract with a much larger salary to reflect my stats, but for a longer period of time.
* Once you become a free agent wed like to offer you a six year deal for $39 million, Paxson said.

**The Fuckery Begins**

* Booz officially becomes a free agent in June and claims he was just waiting to get the call and to sign the paperwork because he loved the deal and could envision 5-6 titles with Lebron.
* Pelinka calls to tell him the offer is there, but that he also shopped around and got offers from the Hawks, Bobcats, and $70-75 million offers from the Jazz and Nuggets.
* He claims neither he nor Pelinka solicited the offers.
* He claims the NBA League Office called him shortly afterward to warn him that the NBA suspected that he had entered into a Gentlemans Agreement with the Cavs and that the NBA would investigate him if he signed with the Cavs.
* Booz claims he was so freaked out by the pressure that he didnt know what to do
* Claims that he left the entire negotiation at that point up to the NBAPA and they secured the deal with the Jazz

**Hindsight is 20/20 (apologies to Gordon)**

* I blame Paxson for fucking this entire thing up royally.
* He should have picked up the 3rd year and then extended or matched any offer in the offseason.
* He also could have matched the Jazz offer and he didnt, which was a mistake.
* I looked into the details on that and, yes, he could have actually matched, but he didnt want to make the roster moves necessary to do it.
* But its fucking amazing how Pelinka behaved during this. He helps induce the Cavs into letting Booz become a free agent, then he shops Booz around to other teams, then he makes sure the league knows about the Cavs trying to sign Booz so that it looks like a gentlemans agreement.
* You almost have to appreciate how much of a scumbag the guy is.

With a core of Brown, Booz, and Z I think the Cavs would have gone to the NBA Finals in 07, 08, 09, and 10.

Keep in mind that it took the ""Big 3"" Celtics absolutely everything to dispatch the Cavs in 7 in 2008. With Boozer on that team, there's just no question the Cavs win. Lebron just needed a tiny, extra lift. Booz represented way more than a tiny lift.

2024-01-10,1704919821,[Stein] The Cleveland Cavaliers continue to show no interest in moving Donovan Mitchell or Jarrett Allen before the trade deadline as evident by Cleveland's desire to acquire a 3&amp;D wings to bolster the roster before the trade deadline.,"Source: https://marcstein.substack.com/p/the-latest-on-donovan-mitchell-and

&gt; The Cavaliers continue to send signals that they have no interest in fielding trade offers for Donovan Mitchell. Zero interest. Although pessimism persists about Clevelands chances of signing him to a long-term contract extension, Mitchell is under contract in Cleveland for one full season after this one at nearly $35 million in 2024-25, so the Cavaliers certainly face no mandate to entertain trade proposals right now  especially in the absence of Mitchell pushing for anything of the sort. Their stance is that the current team, which is in the mix for the Easts No. 4 seed at 21-15, still has a chance to make noise this season when Evan Mobley (knee) and Darius Garland (jaw) return from injury. Team officials have likewise been emboldened by a recent 8-3 surge without Mobley and Garland & and with Jarrett Allen playing some of the best basketball of his career to likewise hush any notion that the Cavaliers are willing to deal Allen any time soon.

&gt; Support for the idea that the Cavaliers want to play this season out before contemplating major roster changes stems from what league sources describe as Clevelands desire to upgrade its wing options before next months trade buzzer. Turner Sports Chris Haynes mentioned Clevelands interest in pursuing 3-and-D targets on a recent edition of our #thisleague UNCUT podcast and Ive heard the same. Any such trade would naturally be classified as a win-now move for the Cavaliers, who are desperate to make a stronger postseason impression than we saw last spring, when they followed up a 51-win campaign with a meek five-game exit to New York in the first round of the playoffs.",clevelandcavs,129,https://www.reddit.com/r/clevelandcavs/comments/193is62/stein_the_cleveland_cavaliers_continue_to_show_no/

2024-04-28,1714327421,Trading for Donovan Mitchell While Keeping JB Has Ruined Darius Garlands Development(Evan Mobley as well to a lesser extent),"I believe that Darius Garland and Evan Mobleys growth was/is the key to this team, and rushing the timeline by dropping a ball dominant, high usage iso scorer into the lineup when they were 20/21 and 22/23 has hurt them, especially since the offensive system built around them and Donovan by JB has been absolutely putrid and is basically 2000s basketball with some modern touches. Darius should've been allowed to contine to grow as the engine of the offense and Mobley should've been featured more in the offensive game plan to continue developing him on that side of the ball and his aggressiveness. They both actively take a backseat to Donovan and don't really try to get into games or take over games until it's too late, and without being in rhythm. I agree that Darius takes ill-advised shots, among other things, but he's a young player trying to heat up in a bad offensive system where he can't get into rhythm at time cause it's ""your turn, my turn"" iso ball. Doing that takes away one of Darius greatest strengths which is his ability to control a game with his playmaking. I understand wanting to trade Darius, so I'm not going to call someone crazy for thinking that, but I believe trading Donovan is the best way to recoup and try to save the development of Evan and DG.",clevelandcavs,153,https://www.reddit.com/r/clevelandcavs/comments/1cfco9h/trading_for_donovan_mitchell_while_keeping_jb_has/

2024-02-27,1709048224,Evan Mobley and the quiet agony of small improvements [OC Analysis]," \[Hi, all! I originally created this for the general NBA audience of r/nba, but figured I'd post here, too. My ""[Darius Garland is a goldfish](https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/15rrt0h/darius_garland_is_a_goldfish/)"" post from this past summer was well-received here, so hopefully you enjoy this one also!\]

There has been so much handwringing about Evan Mobley and his failure to develop a three-point shot. The Cleveland Cavaliers had massive success for nearly two months by surrounding Donovan Mitchell and Jarrett Allen with shooters; while the team has consistently won since Mobleys return, most of the talk about the Cavs centers around the broken-jigsaw fit of having two non-shooting bigs in the starting lineup. Its a fair conversation to have, but it also doesnt paint the whole picture.

First, let us address the trumpeting elephant in the room: No, Mobley has not miraculously turned into a sniper since his return from injury. After arthroscopic knee surgery to remove loose bodies in his knee, Mobley spent much of the time he missed talking about  and practicing  three-pointers. It hasnt mattered.

Mobley is still reluctant to let it fly from behind the arc. I hand-tracked his triples this season (thats not an eat the tape humblebrag; it took about three seconds). Mobley has only attempted 25 triples all season. 15 of those have come in the 12 games since Jan 29th, when Mobley returned from injury. So thats an improvement, and he is technically 40% from deep! But 1.25 attempts per game does not change how defenses treat him, and its merely in line with his averages before this season.

*\[Hello, everyone! Thanks for reading. As always, I've collected a bunch of illustrative video clips for this post. You can* [*view them in-context here*](https://www.basketballpoetry.com/p/evan-mobley-and-the-quiet-agony-of)*\]*

Out of his 15 misfires, one was blocked, and one was a heave. Out of the remaining 13, nine were short. He seldom misses long, right, or left. Consistently missing short can be a product of nerves as much as poor shot biomechanics.

Its a lizard-or-the-egg thing: Mobley doesnt make many threes because he isnt confident, but because hes not confident, he doesnt make many. Its a vicious ouroboros. And as national discourse will let you know, this is a capital-P Problem when the team also starts a former All-Star at center in Jarrett Allen.

The Problem, laid out: Allen and Mobley are fantastic defensive players with real offensive skills, but the Cavs simply have trouble scoring when they share the court. [Their 112.6 points per 100 possessions is in the 30th percentile ](https://cleaningtheglass.com/stats/team/6/lineups?on=4337&amp;on=4866#tab-four_factors)for all lineups.

Interestingly, the[ team actually has a slightly worse offense](https://cleaningtheglass.com/stats/player/4866/lineups?on=4866&amp;off=4337#tab-four_factors) when Mobley is the lone big (and gets outscored overall); meanwhile, when Allen is the center without Mobley on the court, the team [scores a strong 120.3 points per 100](https://cleaningtheglass.com/stats/team/6/lineups?on=4337&amp;off=4866#tab-four_factors) and blitzes teams by a substantial margin.

But the Mobley = less spacing = less scoring talk oversimplifies things. Most obviously, Allen/Mobley lineups get it back on the other end. [Those lineups only allow 108 points per 100](https://cleaningtheglass.com/stats/team/6/lineups?on=4866&amp;on=4337#tab-four_factors), 95th percentile for all lineups. That number stays true with Mitchell and Garland sharing the court, too.

For the season, lineups with all four of Mobley, Allen, Mitchell, and Garland have performed well, [scoring at a median rate](https://cleaningtheglass.com/stats/team/6/lineups?on=4866&amp;on=4337&amp;on=4362&amp;on=4576#tab-four_factors) (yes, really) while locking teams down defensively. Those groups are winning their minutes by a comfortable, though not monstrous, margin. And the numbers are better since Mobleys return on Jan 29th. As a team, the Cavs are eighth in offense and third in defense since then, even as Mobley and guard Darius Garland work their way back from injury.

Sure, the schedule has been bounce-house soft. But that stretch also included a win over the Clippers and a blowout of the Kings. The Cavs are 10-3 since Mobleys return; two of those losses occurred when Donovan Mitchell, the teams best player, was out sick, and the remaining loss was by two points.

So yes, Mobleys offensive fit isnt perfect next to Allen. But that doesnt mean it cant work, and to be honest, Im not particularly interested in what they should do in the offseason just yet. The Cavs are here now, and theyre good. Theyre second in the East! Mobley remains a big part of that, even if his injury has prevented him from showing his peak form.

The shot is one  very important!  thing, but Mobley has made a number of improvements to other parts of his game this season while battling the knee injury (and recovery process). The quiet things matter, too.

His already impressive defense has only gotten better. He demolishes foes one-on-one: [opponents score just 0.64 points per possession against him on an island](https://apps.synergysports.com/basketball/players/615d0923e771e94fc00a6ba2/playtypes?seasonId=651b131d1507a2202c01094c&amp;offense=false), even better than last years excellent showing. Its almost the exact same number when ballhandlers attempt to test him in the pick-and-roll this season, again among the leagues best and a far better mark than last years .92 points per possession.

Mobley has become a master of verticality. Hes a quick jumper who blocks a shocking number of floaters, a shot specifically designed to get over the heads of defenders like Mobley before they can react: \[[video here](https://www.basketballpoetry.com/p/evan-mobley-and-the-quiet-agony-of)\]

Hes now one of the leagues best big-man close-out artists. He scuttles rapidly to the shooter like a tap-dancing crustacean, hands out but perfectly balanced. His length allows him to contest shooters (or at least face-guard) without having to leave his feet, allowing him to bottle up foolish attempts to attack: \[[video here](https://www.basketballpoetry.com/p/evan-mobley-and-the-quiet-agony-of)\]

There have also been offensive improvements, even if theyre not the ones people want. In the playoffs last year, Mobley struggled in space against the New York Knicks. Hed get the ball on the short roll, and you could see the wheels turning in his head as he froze. The offense seemingly ground to a halt whenever he touched the rock.

This year, Mobley's become a more decisive passer. Hes averaging a career-high 3.2 assists per 36 minutes, which would be higher if the teams offense didnt have two ball-dominant guards (and fifth starter Max Strus and Allen are sneaky-good passers, too). There is future post-hub potential with Mobley. Hes more creative with his angles: \[[video here](https://www.basketballpoetry.com/p/evan-mobley-and-the-quiet-agony-of)\]

He can even run the occasional big-big pick-and-roll. This is catnip for basketball nerds (\*bats at highlight, sneezes, falls asleep\*):

\[[video here](https://www.basketballpoetry.com/p/evan-mobley-and-the-quiet-agony-of)\]

When Mobley decides to attack (and yes, he should attack more), hes not settling for half-hooks as often. A significant portion of his diet has [shifted from floater range to right at the rack](https://cleaningtheglass.com/stats/player/4866#tab-shooting_accuracy), boosting his shot profile. That holds even when hes playing next to Allen. Hes putting a crowbar into the defenses cracks and forcing just enough space for spinny finger-rolls and Stretch Armstrong dunks.

Mobleys best offensive skill has become cutting, and hes developed fantastic timing with Garland and Strus, especially: \[[video here](https://www.basketballpoetry.com/p/evan-mobley-and-the-quiet-agony-of)\]

Mobleys rebounding has upgraded, too, and this isnt simply a result of him playing more center (although that is the reason for his slight uptick in fouls). Weirdly, he actually has a[ higher rebounding rate as a power forward](https://cleaningtheglass.com/stats/player/4866/positions#tab-defense_rebounding).

For what its worth, his free throw percentage has improved each year and currently sits at 73%, which could matter at the end of games.

In other words, Mobley *is* getting better. We all agree that Mobley would be significantly improved with a three-point shot. A more aggressive mindset would be welcome, too. Both would fix a lot of what ails Cleveland. But that shot aint coming this season, so the team needs to ensure that they put themselves in the best position to succeed with what they have. Mobley is polishing other aspects of his game to help.

The conversation reminds me of the talk around Bam Adebayo, whose subtle improvements over the years never seem to satisfy a fanbase constantly bleating for more, more, more. And to some extent, I get it. When a players ceiling is as high as Mobleys, and the way to reach it is *so obvious,* how couldnt fans get frustrated?

But real-life basketball players arent 2K simulacrums. You cant spend real money to change a players DNA (although teams certainly try!). Mobley will likely earn a max rookie extension this summer, and he has limitless potential, particularly at center, surrounded by shooters. But evidence suggests hes also not as good a center as Jarrett Allen *right now;* for the short term, the Cavs will continue staggering them as much as possible, hoping the defensive dominance when they do share the court outweighs any offensive sludginess. Its not a perfect solution, but basketball doesnt hand out too many of those. The Cavs are making lemonade out of some pretty good lemons.

There are still a few cards to play in the playoffs, too. Max Strus has almost always been the fifth wheel for the core four. Can we see some Dean Wade there, perhaps? Wade is bigger and stronger than Strus and likely a better positional defender (although Strus is feisty). He doesnt have the quick trigger Strus does, but he is a more accurate shooter. It would be an interesting playoff wrinkle to run out bigger lineups that theoretically dont sacrifice much shooting. Georges Niang in that spot creates a similar look, although Wade is the better player.

Between Strus, Wade, Niang, defensive ace Isaac Okoro, Caris LeVert, and the emergence of super-shooter Sam Merrill, the Cavs arent limited to one or two role-player permutations. They can put out enough trees to fill a forest, opt to field four shooters, or go for a tenacious defensive lineup. We might even see Mobley, Allen, or Garland sit minutes in crunch time if the team gets desperate. Coach J.B. Bickerstaff will have to figure out how best to utilize the tools at his disposal (something hes struggled with at times), but hes got a full workbench to play with, at least.

The playoffs expose all. Last year, it showed that Mobley and the Cavs were too limited. This years team is deeper; more importantly, this years Mobley is even better. Whether the subtle improvements on the margins are enough to propel Cleveland deep into the spring will be a source of agony to Cavs fans until then.",clevelandcavs,45,https://www.reddit.com/r/clevelandcavs/comments/1b1erwg/evan_mobley_and_the_quiet_agony_of_small/

2024-05-21,1716309131,Summary of Windhorst Interview on ESPN Cleveland ,"Windy on ESPN Cleveland (summarized):

The Cavs had some meetings yesterday and have more today. Things cooled off and the future of the organization are being discussed. JB and Koby are in these meetings. He expects a decision imminently.


Contd:

Look at what is happening with the LA Lakers. What JB did with the Cavs is more impressive than what Darvin Ham did with the Lakers. The Lakers are having trouble finding a replacement. Cavs have to be careful with the coaching market too.


Contd:

There are candidates who are preparing to interview with the Cavs because they are seeing there could be a change (they have not been contacted by Cavs). Also, the Cavs are in the East which makes it more appealing vs being in the West. Pay will not be an issue


Contd:

Mitchell's feelings towards JB will have an impact on if JB comes back or not. When you ask a star player to sign an extension with a coach on thin ice, you have to consider what they think. A player never wants to be accredited with the hiring or firing of a coach.


Contd: 

Nothing has changed in the last week on a Mitchell extension. The new rules significantly impact the Cavs, as soon as the NBA Finals end the Cavs can begin contract extension talks with him. That means nothing can be done for 3-4 weeks.


Finally:

Donovan Mitchell is an expert at PR and everyone in the locker room thinks he will re-sign.

2024-07-23,1721769161,Pelton (ESPN) ranks Jalen Tyson as 3rd best rookie in NBA Summer League,"# Best rookies:

1. 1Kel'el Ware, [Miami Heat](https://archive.ph/o/OM8Cy/https://www.espn.com/nba/team/_/name/mia/miami-heat)
2. 2[Tristan da Silva](https://archive.ph/o/OM8Cy/https://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/4702382/tristan-da-silva), [Orlando Magic](https://archive.ph/o/OM8Cy/https://www.espn.com/nba/team/_/name/orl/orlando-magic)

Playing every game for the Heat en route to the final, Ware averaged 18.0 points, 8.3 rebounds and 1.5 blocks in a well-rounded performance that suggests he might be able to battle for minutes in Miami as a rookie. Ware, the No. 15 pick out of Indiana, recorded four double-doubles -- including one in the title game -- and had 24 points on 9-of-12 shooting, 10 rebounds and 3 blocks in his best performance against the [Dallas Mavericks](https://archive.ph/o/OM8Cy/https://www.espn.com/nba/team/_/name/dal/dallas-mavericks).Having played just three games, da Silva made a strong statement, particularly with his 3-point shooting. A 40% 3-point shooter from the college line at Colorado, da Silva went 10-of-17 (59%) beyond the arc while averaging 17.7 points per game. Perhaps more sustainable was da Silva's playmaking, as he handed out nine assists in three games.Another experienced college player from the Pac-12 (Ware also started his career at Oregon before he transferred to Indiana), Tyson bounced back from a four-point outing midweek to put up 44 points in his last two games in Vegas and came within an assist of a triple-double against the [Los Angeles Lakers](https://archive.ph/o/OM8Cy/https://www.espn.com/nba/team/_/name/lal/los-angeles-lakers). Tyson achieved 50/40/90 shooting splits and also averaged 7.0 rebounds and 4.4 assists from the [wing.Best](http://wing.Best) rookies:

Allen feared what could happen after what occurred to Tyrod Taylor.,"Source: https://marcstein.substack.com/p/nba-trade-talk-and-free-agency-chatter

&gt; Look for Cleveland's Jarrett Allen to become one of the most coveted trade targets in the league this offseason if the Cavaliers A) succeed in signing Donovan Mitchell to a contract extension and then B) prioritize signing Evan Mobley to a potentially maximum contract extension this summer as increasingly expected.

&gt; Allen continues to have numerous admirers in rival front offices despite the whispers of frustration circulating in Cleveland surrounding Allen's apparent reluctance to take a pain-killing injection to address a rib injury that sidelined him for the Cavaliers' final eight playoff games.

&gt; On the latest #thisleague UNCUT podcast (link below), my co-host Chris Haynes of Turner Sports illuminated Allen's very understandable reluctance for doing so, reporting that Allen did not want to submit to such an injection because of what happened in the NFL to quarterback Tyrod Taylor. In September 2020, then playing for the Chargers, Taylor sustained a punctured lung when a pain-killing shot was administered to treat a rib injury.",clevelandcavs,219,https://www.reddit.com/r/clevelandcavs/comments/1cvx650/stein_cleveland_is_expected_to_shop_c_jarrett/

---------------------------------------------------

The national media won't say it, but we should know...

## **Ice is the best perimeter defender in the league**

The recent resume

| Player | Shooting % vs Ice | Number of games |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Damian Lillard | 26.5% | four |
| Trae Young | 50.0%  | three |
| Paolo Banchero | 25.0% | three |
| Jaylen Brown | 12.5% | two |
| James Harden | 20.0% | one |
| Paul George | 20.0% | one |
| Devin Vassell | 37.5% | one |

That accounts for almost 1/5th of the season, I count 4 Hall of Famers in that list, this isn't a fluke

[Mitchell already knows](https://twitter.com/IsaacOkoroFan/status/1752169539255640327) and is campaigning for his guy

Ice is on a direct path to the all-defensive team, he's been special in this stretch let's enjoy and acknowledge it.

## **How does he do it?**

Strength of a PF with the hips of a 2 guard, he mirrors defenders really well allowing him to take away their air space to get a quick pull up off (Dame's bread and butter for example) 

His strength allows him to absorb contact when players drive on him and push them off their line to the lane, turning a layup into a fade away

He's not playing overly aggressive, he's under control, he has **never averaged more than 2 fouls per game** in any season

## **What else can we expect moving forward**

This isn't that new, Okoro has had games where he's bothered all-nba smaller guards dating back to his rookie year ([one example](https://www.reddit.com/r/clevelandcavs/comments/qrmvpz/shout_out_to_okoro_bradley_beal_held_to_season/), specifically holding a league leading Beal to his worst night of his season shooting 21%), **it's that he's now consistently doing it**.

Here's my [pre-draft scouting report on Ice](https://www.reddit.com/r/clevelandcavs/comments/jx9b1p/isaac_okoro_deep_dive/), if you want some insight into his game (186 upvotes, worth your time)

While this offseason is about re-signing Donovan, ICE will be on our list of players to pay too (RFA this offseason, we'll match anything thrown at him)

He's going to continue to close out games, his on-ball defense is just that valuable...what our closing lineup looks like it going to be interesting (our offense and defensive subs at end of game are killers in Sam and Ice)

the player he currently **most reminds me of is GS era Andre Iguodala** (which was one of his ceiling comps in my draft preview)",clevelandcavs,56,https://www.reddit.com/r/clevelandcavs/comments/1aesyic/wake_up_cleveland_the_best_perimeter_defender_in/

2024-05-19,1716149768,"[Stein/Windhorst] The Cavaliers are ""very optimistic"" behind the scenes that they will secure Donovan Mitchell's contract extension this summer. There is pessimism in league circles about Bickerstaff retaining his job. ","Source: https://marcstein.substack.com/p/nba-trade-talk-and-free-agency-chatter

&gt; My longtime former teammate Brian Windhorst said this week on ESPN's Hoop Collective podcast that the Cavaliers are ""very optimistic"" behind the scenes that they will secure Mitchell's contract extension this summer.

&gt; They can only hope such optimism proves justified. For all the rising chatter about coach J.B. Bickerstaff's dwindling job security and the growing belief that either Allen and Darius Garland (or both) could be dealt before next season, there is unmistakable pressure on the Cavaliers' front office first and foremost until Mitchell commits, all thanks to what they gave up to get him.

&gt; As for Bickerstaff, there is an unmistakably pessimistic tone in coaching circles about retaining his job. Despite leading Cleveland to its first triumph in a playoff series without LeBron James in uniform since 1993, Bickerstaff now faces similar difficulties that ultimately helped doom Frank Vogel in Phoenix.",clevelandcavs,50,https://www.reddit.com/r/clevelandcavs/comments/1cvx9fr/steinwindhorst_the_cavaliers_are_very_optimistic/

The kicker here is that we own our pick, it may be the last time for a while at a high draft pick. The raptors did this and the warriors as well. We still have a great core in Mobley, Garland and Allen with some quality role players. If we can exchange Mitchell for a wing or others of equal value, there wont ever be a better time to do it. It either happens in the next couple of months, we get picks and a player or two back plus a big draft pick, or we lock in our commitment to him and roll the dice on him coming back to join this core.

Now Darius Garland, [who lost 12 pounds in a month because of his liquid diet](https://www.fearthesword.com/2024/2/1/24057779/cleveland-cavaliers-darius-garland-reveals-he-lost-12-pounds-due-to-fractured-jaw) isnt playing up to his standards and people are calling him the worst contract in the nba 

Are you people seriously so daft you dont understand what it takes to lose 12 pounds in one month? Do you really not understand that having to drink everything makes it so much harder build and maintain muscle. 

Darius Garland had to drink 4,000 calories at least through a fucking straw and you clowns act like nothing should change. Please dear god, throw your next meal in a blender and then tell me how much DG sucks

2024-05-16,1715827828,"[Charania] Multiple veterans on the team, including Donovan Mitchell, were frustrated with Bickerstaff. They felt as though he was treating the team as young with much to learn rather than a contending team. Players would leave practices wondering: Why did we even do that? What did we accomplish","Source: https://www.nytimes.com/athletic/5497268/2024/05/15/cavaliers-donovan-mitchell-darius-garland-jb-bickerstaff-future/?source=user_shared_article

&gt; Bickerstaffs tenure was mired by post-All-Star break slumps each of the last three years and a Play-In collapse in 2022. Last year, the Cavs entered the playoffs as the No. 4 seed and were dismissed by the New York Knicks in five games.

&gt; The second guessing of Bickerstaff started there. Multiple veterans in the Cavs locker room grew frustrated with Bickerstaff for treating the Cavs as a young team with much to learn, instead of as a team ready to contend. They were also less than enthused by the Cavs offense last spring and into the first part of this season. Mitchell was among them. Players would leave practices and morning shootarounds wondering aloud: Why did we even do that? What did we accomplish  so perplexed by the lack of structure and intensity in the workouts.

&gt; Bickerstaffs usage of Mitchell, league sources said, was a reason Mitchell provided when declining an invitation to play for USA Basketball last summer at the FIBA World Cup  a refusal that went a long way toward his exclusion from the Olympic team.",clevelandcavs,98,https://www.reddit.com/r/clevelandcavs/comments/1ct2yu6/charania_multiple_veterans_on_the_team_including/
