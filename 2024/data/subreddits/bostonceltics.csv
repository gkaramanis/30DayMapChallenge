Then it hit me.

Once these guys retire, all we will have left of them are highlights. All we will have physically left of them will be their jerseys - Tatum 0 , Brown 7 - just hanging on the walls, as they fall to history with the rest of the great Celtics players.

I remember when Brady and the Pats were so good and thought it would last forever. Now Brady is a commentator and the Pats have started 1-4 for 4 seasons in a row.

2024-07-05,1720181606,"(Shaughnessy) In conversations with some sources close to the situation, Ive come away convinced that soon-to-be-90-year-old H. Irving Grousbeck is the one driving this sale and that 63-year-old son Wyc...actually owns a relatively small stake in the franchise.","Irving Grousbeck  still teaching at Stanford Business School  has been the money behind the group since the beginning and theres every indication that the billionaire (Forbes lists Irving Grousbeck and familys worth at $1.8 billion) rarely seen at Celtics games is motivating this sale in an attempt to get his affairs in order.

H. Irving Grousbeck made his fortune as cofounder of Continental Cablevision and is no doubt interested in ongoing negotiations for the NBAs media rights. A nine-year deal is set to expire at the end of next season and the new deal (reportedly close to $76 billion) will have considerable impact on franchise values.

I emailed the elder Grousbeck late Wednesday, requesting comment on my assertions, and he responded Thursday with a polite no comment.

When I texted Wyc with, You OK if I say your personal stake in the team is less than 2 percent?, he answered, We hold as a family  all unified . . . We are a family and I also have a Celtics family is my comment. Thanks.

This leads us to Steve Pagliuca, often identified as co-owner of the Celtics. Pags made his money at Bain Capital and has been Wyc Grousbecks wingman since the group bought the team. Pags is the one who had the idea to hire Danny Ainge, who wound up being the genius to acquire Kevin Garnett, Ray Allen, Rajon Rondo (2008 champs), then Jaylen Brown, Jayson Tatum, Brad Stevens, and Joe Mazzulla.

Many fans want Pagliuca to emerge as the next majority owner of the team and Pags made his intentions clear the day the sale was announced, issuing this statement: Being a co-investor and managing partner of the Celtics has been a great honor and a labor of love. I hope to be part of the Celtics moving forward and will be a proud participant in the bidding process that has been announced today.

2024-02-15,1708007927,Joe Mazzulla deserves a lot more credit,"Derrick White said something today about Joe Mazzulla [here](https://x.com/CelticsCLNS/status/1757976871365411147?s=20) that should remind Celtics fans about how good Joe is. Basically, D-White said that on the year Cs got to the finals with that monstrous defense, its **Joe**, not Ime, who was the defensive mastermind of their schemes. Remember that they have Ime, Hardy, and Stoudamire on that staff, but its Joe's idea that they were using.

He's also the two guys from Brad's staff that was retained. Then when they faced the Heat on 2022 playoffs, Joe was in-charge of their scouting and gameplan against Spo, and guys like Horford (can't find it again) and [Brogdon](https://celticswire.usatoday.com/lists/was-joe-mazzulla-the-mastermind-behind-bostons-defense-last-year/) said that his scouting was sort of legendary. (Probably Ime was messing around with the team staff during this important time, maybe why basketball gods punished em to lose.)

And when Hardy was hired by Jazz, it was Joe who got promoted to lead assistant to replace Will. Not Stoudamire or Sullivan or any of Ime's guys.

Then when he stepped up on this mess, they've still managed to finished Top 2 on Off. and Def. Ratings last season despite of Rob Williams and Marcus Smart not being the same defensively due to injuries.

This year, he's now more experienced and relaxed, creative (read about Adam Taylor's blogs that highlights Joe's X and Os), and handles the team very well despite of its talent, where everyone is bought in. Every interview, I noticed that guys like Jaylen often resonates what Joe wants to do, like the word 'playing with intentionality', so clearly Joe's voice is being heard in the locker room.

If anyone is still not bought in to Joe at this point, maybe ask why he has Brad's trust. Don't listen to guys like Perk, Bill, Felger etc. who are all running their mouth. Even Zach Lowe admitted in his last pod that talking to Joe personally made him feel like an idiot basketball standpoint.

I have a few friends and relatives who are Boston fans. I respect their passion and they can trash talk as well as me, which is nice. This week, though I realized they've been living in a bubble. It's a lot of ""I'm not worried, our team is obviously the superior team. You have a nice little story for a 5 seed"". These people have not been watching any non-Celtics basketball games, and are just deep in Celtics message boards. All they know about Luka is that he whines and he's a flopper (lol)

Bro, your team is out there getting cooked by T.J. McConnell and Aaron Nesmith. We have the best player in the world. They are not ready for this.

That's the thing about Luka though. You have to actually watch him play. If all you do is watch SportsCenter highlights and listen to podcasts you can't understand what he's doing. He's not like LeBron or Kobe or Giannis where you can tell 10 seconds that he's the best player on the floor. He wears you down over time.

Watch Luka 5 minutes: Who the hell is this guy. He's slow and out of shape, he can't jump, he doesn't play defense, and he's bitching about calls on every play. This is the guy you're telling me is the future of basketball?

Watch him for 20 minutes: How did that shot go in? Wait are we just gonna leave guys open in the corner for him to pass to every time? Why aren't we defending Luka he's slow we should put people on him!

Watch him for one game: He got lucky so many of his 3s went in. It'll be different next time. He'll fold once someone punches him in the face and the refs won't listen to his crying.

Watch about a month: Holy shit how does anybody ever beat this guy.

This is why he's even better in the playoffs. One game during the regular season sure you can do what you can to hold him in and move on the next day. Having to face him night after night is a nightmare. We're see it series after series by the time these teams get to game 5 or 6 they just look completely cooked.

The Celtics are soft and the East is a joke. Boston fans who think they're just gonna walk to a championship are about to find out.

2023-11-29,1701226410,Your Boston Celtics have won Group C and have advanced to the bracket stage of the In-Season Tournament!,"Going into tonight, the Celtics needed to win against Chicago by more than 22 points, as well as needing the Nets to win, and do so by 8 points less than Boston at minimum. With a Celtics 27 point win against Chicago, they needed the Nets to win by 19 points or less, and they won by 12 points. Heres how the top of the group looks:

Celtics: 3-1, +27 PD

Magic: 3-1, +22 PD

Nets: 3-1, +20 PD

Because the Magic beat the Celtics on Friday, the Magic owned the Head to Head tiebreaker against Boston, meaning the only way Boston could win the tiebreaker was through a 3 way point differential tiebreaker, which is why they needed a Brooklyn win tonight. With Brooklyns 12 point win, the Celtics will play in the bracket stage!

What?

He threw for us in the playoffs. He promised he'd come back. He left. He came to our stadium, beat us, stomped on our logo. Then he came back to our stadium, threw us the middle fingers and told our fans to suck my d b----. Lost just to go on twitch to mock the Boston ""cockroaches.""

Let me say that I love this. This is competition, this is how it works; you compete and usually end up hating each other. I have respect to Kyrie for taking this all on.

But that's why we need to give it to him. He's asking for it. There's no ""forgive and forget :)"" because I promise you Kyrie has not forgotten.

2024-08-12,1723497610,"More Payton Pritchard wedding content f/ Blake, Larry","
The full article from Elle:

When Emma MacDonald and Payton Pritchard began planning their wedding, they knew it would have to take place late in the summer. As the point guard for the Boston Celtics, even early on, Payton had an inkling that his team would be competing well into the playoffs. It was an apt callon June 18, the Celtics won their 18th championship, a major moment for Payton, Emma, and the city they call home.

**The victory made the couples wedding a two-fold celebration. The ceremony was officiated by Blake Griffin, who played for the team before he retired in April. Everyone was like, Oh my gosh, this is going to be the best summer everPayton is going to get two rings: the championship ring and his wedding band, Emma shares. Players like Jaylen Brown, Oshae Brissett, Sam Hauser, Jaden Springer, and Xavier Tillman were in attendance, along with coach Joe Mazzulla, Celtics governor Wyc Grousbeck, and his wife, Emilia Fazzalari. The NBA Championship trophy made a special appearance, too. Theres some sort of map or calendar that documents where theyre bringing it, Emma says. They wanted our wedding to be one of the stops for the trophy. Guests lined up for photos with the hardware.**

As far as the location, Emma, who grew up on Cape Cod, always knew she wanted a hometown, beachside wedding that would introduce guests, including Paytons Oregon-based family, to the area. They could spend a week out here before or after our wedding to really experience what I got to experience growing up, because the summertime here is my favorite thing in the whole entire world, she says.

A night out with friends at the tiki bar at the Ocean House in Dennis Port started the weekend off on Thursday. 

Emma looked at three venues, but when she saw the Wychmere Beach Club, she knew it was the one. They turned a dock into a room, she says. When you look out the window, its the ocean, which is the coolest thing ever. Boats will go by. When I walked in, it felt perfect. I just love how it has an indoor-outdoor [element]. You can be outside on the water or you can go inside for cocktail hour.

The Rehearsal Dinner

On Friday, the couple held an all-white rehearsal dinner for their families and bridal parties in their backyard. It was catered by Mahoneys in Orleans, a town in Massachusetts.

[It was] more of a sit-down dinner, Emma says. I wanted it to still feel a little bit formal. Instead of doing clam bake, when youre putting on the bib and cracking into all the food, they passed around steak and lobster. It still bought the Cape in, but [was] a bit more formal in the backyard. They also served caviar on Cape Cod chips, an exciting spin on a local favorite.

Later, they went to Ember in Harwich Port, where they were joined by all the wedding guests. We snuck out early, because we wanted to head to bed and wake up early. We stayed together the night before, Emma says. People normally dont do that, but were not very traditional.

When they woke up, Emma and Payton exchanged private vows that they had written for each other. A local coffee shop, Lighthouse Keepers Pantry, brought over pastries and coffee while Emma and her friends got ready.

Emma found a Vera Wang dress that wasnt anything like what she had expected. I wanted something super simple, elegant, not crazy at all, she says. The dress I went with is a huge, princess-looking dress. It has a corset top, a ton of tulle on the bottom. Its massivenot at all what I thought I was going to wear.

She added: The dress that I tried on before my actual ceremony dress was this beautiful Anne Barge, just an elegant, simple, strapless, mermaid-style dress. I put that on and I was like, This is the dress. I love it, but it was just a little bit too simple for my sister. I decided to do a ceremony dress that was very out-there and fun and then switch into a more elegant, easy dress for dancing, dinner, all the things, so that Im comfy. She ended the night in a Monique Lhuillier minidress.

**Blake Griffin, a former Celtic and close friend of the grooms, officiated the wedding. He was there since our third date, Emma reveals. He was Paytons go-to guy when we started talking. He was playing in Dallas a couple days later, so I flew there and he was texting Blake, nervous, being like, What should I do? Should I ask her if she wants her own hotel room? Blake was this guy being like, Yeah, this is what you should do, helping him out. Then that night, he third-wheeled our date. I got to talking with Blake and he was like, Oh, I know this is the girl for Payton. Hes going to marry her right away. Six months after we met, we got engaged. Blake has been there since the start.**

Emma walked down the aisle to Lana Del Reys Young and Beautiful on strings. The song was kind of a surprise, since its one of his favorite songs, she says. I hardly even remember the ceremony; I was just so excited.

The officiant got rave reviews for his performance. Blake did such a good job, Emma says. Everyone in the crowd was laughing, and then he had his times where he was serious. I think everyone enjoyed that. Payton, who is very much not a crier, did admittedly shed some tears.

It was a truly an incredibly beautiful wedding, Blake offers. Getting to marry Payton and Emma was so special to me. The entire weekend was perfect.

Emma and Payton entered the reception to the Tems song Me &amp; U. The maid of honor, best man, and Emma and Paytons fathers each gave speeches, along with Jaylen Brown.

The after-party was completely different from the cocktail hour, even though they were held in the same room, Emma says. The cocktails were very sophisticated and chic-looking, and the after-party was balloons all over the ceiling. There were glow-up lights to [color] the room. We literally felt like we walked into a club...no one stopped dancing. There was a cigar roller outside, and the cigars had a little 11 [Paytons jersey number] on them. There was also a nacho bar to satisfy late-night cravings. We went over to see if there was anything left right before the end of the night, Emma says. Completely cleared. Everyone loved it.

2023-12-13,1702506022,An adjustment Joe made last night could have big playoff implications,"A lot of our biggest threats in the playoffs have really dangerous pullup-shooting guards (Dame in Milwaukee, Murray in Denver, Maxey in Philly, etc.), which is a problem for Boston if KP can only play in drop coverage. Yesterday was a big stress test for our ability to defend these actions since Garland and Mitchell were both so hot, and early results were not promising. Here, Jaylen brown loses contact with Mitchell going under a screen, and gives up a wide open 3 since KP is dropped so deep.

https://reddit.com/link/18hswtz/video/jiqpkuplt46c1/player

On this play, Mitchell loses White with a screen reject (he loves to reject  ball screens), and KP is dropped well below the free throw line while Mitchell nails the easy jumper.

&amp;#x200B;

https://reddit.com/link/18hswtz/video/amk5potou46c1/player

If Joe doesn't trust Porzingis to come up higher in pick and roll, how can we expect to guard teams like Denver and Milwaukee in the playoffs? We got a preview of one possible adjustment coming out of halftime. Tatum was the primary matchup against the Cavs' center, while KP guarded a wing. On this play, the Cavs still target KP in drop, but since a smaller player is setting the screen, White can recover and get a good contest.

https://reddit.com/link/18hswtz/video/9spak8gfx46c1/player

The Celtics would even pre-switch Porzingis out of the action, like this play, where White blows up the pick and roll with some heads-up communication and switching, forcing Mitchell into a tough sidestep 3.

https://reddit.com/link/18hswtz/video/oad6m084t46c1/player

This plan worked especially well when Okoro was on the floor for the Cavs. That way, KP could ""guard"" a non-shooter on the perimeter and help in the paint while the rest of the Celtics switched. Players like Aaron Gordon or Josh Okogie could present similar opportunities in the postseason.

One drawback of this coverage is that Tatum has to fight with centers on the glass. He gave up one offensive rebound to Allen, but mostly held his own in this respect. Still, against the Jokic's or Embiids of the world, this would be more of a problem.

The Celtics have historically used a similar coverage, but with two bigs where Al played the Tatum role, and this could still be a viable strategy, assuming Horford can still switch. But even if he can't, he might  be able to come up higher on ball screens than KP adding another degree of flexibility to our defense.

The Cavs scored 60 points in the first half and 53 in the second. This adjustment probably played a meaningful role in the dropoff.",bostonceltics,46,https://www.reddit.com/r/bostonceltics/comments/18hswtz/an_adjustment_joe_made_last_night_could_have_big/

After losing to the Miami Heat in the 2023 ECF, this is how the Celtics responded.


Traded for Kristaps Porzingis and Jrue Holiday. Assembling the 5 man lineup of Holiday, White, Brown, Tatum, Porzingis. Might be the scariest 2 way lineup weve ever seen.

Went 64-18 in the regular season and had the best record in the league. Had the best offensive efficiency/rating of all time. The 2nd best defensive efficiency/rating in the league. A top 5 net rating of all time. A top 5 scoring margin of all time. More 30 point leads than 10 point deficits.

Went 16-3 in the playoffs. Never even getting to a game 6. Dominated the finals matchup in 5 where Kyrie Irving went 18 for 53 while playing in Boston and didnt scratch 20 points in TD. Winning the first championship since 2008.

And then the Celtics followed that up with extending Jayson Tatum, Derrick White and Sam Hauser. Horford also clearing up all retirement rumors. Then resigning both Xavier Tillman and Luke Kornet. Bringing back the entire squad for next year.

A+ 2023 Offseason

A+ 2023-2024 Regular Season

A+ 2024 Playoffs 

A+ 2024 Offseason Season

Just straight up perfection.

2024-06-22,1719052186,"Jaylen Brown fires back at Stephen A. Smith again with a ""State Your Source"" shirt at Celtics victory parade","BOSTON -- With all eyes on the NBA champion Boston Celtics on Friday, Jaylen Brown took advantage of another opportunity to fire back at ESPN's Stephen A. Smith. 

With his NBA Finals MVP trophy in his hand, Brown was rocking a ""State Your Source"" shirt when he arrived at TD Garden for Friday's victory parade. The comment is a callback to Brown's viral tweet aimed at the ESPN talking head from a few months ago.

Boston Celtics Victory Event &amp; Parade

The shirt is in reference to Brown's message to Smith at the end of May, when Smith reported that a source told him that Brown wasn't marketable because of his ego. Smith took that source's comments to air, which caused quite a stir.

""It's not so much that he's underrated, it's that he's just not liked because of his, 'I am better than you,' attitude,"" Smith said on air on May 26. ""He knows it. It's the same reason he is not as marketable as he should be. That's what an NBA source just sent me.""

Brown took exception to that comment, and let Smith know via X.

Brown was clearly upset about those comments two months ago, and used them as fuel during Boston's playoff run. He's getting the last laugh as an NBA champ, and will likely have a few marketing opportunities heading his way in the near future.

On Friday, Brown got to clap back at Smith again, but this time he let his championship parade attire do the talking.

""Roosevelt Tillman has been a champion of the city of Grand Rapids and its children. That devotion was especially evident when Mr. Tillman, owner of Tillman Industries, headed up fundraising to keep Grand Rapids city pools open as budget cuts threatened to close them down. His care has been evident, too, in a summer event he hosts to provide school supplies to youngsters.""

2023-11-16,1700142535,Went to the Cs win last night and here are some random thoughts,"I sat right behind the bench last night (work colleague had great seats and couldnt make it and I lucked into them - be kind to your coworkers and things like this happen). My takeaways from the game:

1) Basketball players are huge and might be a different species. Kornet is an alien who played big minutes last night.
2) Tatum has some type of hand issue still. He rests it against a towel. (I have no idea if this was mentioned during the broadcast, but he definitely has a hand issue.)
3) This team really supports each other. When the 76ers made the run to get back in the game, the players were talking to each other on the bench and being supportive.
4) President Stevens was nearby in the stands. At one point he was upset (as upset as he gets) about the gameplay on the defensive end. It was enjoyable watching him as his brain was churning.
5) Horford is the man. He was completely locked in last night. When he was on the stationary bike staying loose during the game, you could see it in his eyes that he was all-in last night.
6) After the game, as D-White was heading to the tunnel, Coach Mazzulla ran up behind and kind of jumped on his back making D-White smile. Cool moment.
7) Hauser is working his ass off to do whatever he can do to make things work on defense. Coaches are in his ear and he is listening and responding.
8) Fast PP was struggling. He was down on himself a couple of times during the game, especially on D when the Sixers made some plays on him - he was showing it on his face.
9) Brown mentioned it in an interview recently, but KP really is a kidder. He had fun with the crowd at certain points before the  game.
10) Highlight of the night. After the win as Tatum was coming off the court, there were a bunch of Cs fan hanging by the tunnel and we started an MVP chant. Remember a few seasons ago when near the end of a blowout the crowd started chanting for Tacko Fall to come into the game and Stevens waved up for the crowd to get louder and then called Tacko in, well Tatum did the same wave as he walked to the tunnel. He didnt shy away from it and embraced it. Very cool.

I dont even know what to say. 155-104??? Are you kidding me??? That felt like the most normal thing that happened that night given the almost unbelievable context that brought me to the game in the first place.

The encouragement I felt from this sub made my night at the Garden absolutely magical. I cant remember a time I could feel so included, and so absolved of the weight of my identity at the same time. I didnt just feel safe and cared for, but absolutely full with nothing holding me down. I finally feel like I can claim my love for basketball, and be queer as fuck, simultaneously. So for that, I owe you guys. 

I also need to give a huge thank you to the Celtics Organization for taking the time to make one fans first game truly special. Ill admit, I was expecting to feel a little used, just in the way that some companies do when trying to prove their allyship. That was not the case. They didnt point at me and say look we got one! or anything like that. They sent Autumn, a rep, to my seat to quietly hand me a bag of Celtics gear and wish me the best time of my life. They just wanted me to fit in, and to give me a chance to see what its like to be a part of the Celtics. Well, I certainly feel like a part of something.

I have a few friends and relatives who are Dallas fans. I respect their passion and they can trash talk as well as me, which is nice. This week, though I realized they've been living in a bubble. It's a lot of ""I'm not worried, our team is obviously the superior team. You had a nice Mickey Mouse run"". These people have not been watching any non-Mavericks basketball games, and are just deep in Mavericks message boards. All they know about Jayson is that he whines and he push off people (lol)

Bro, your team is out there getting cooked by Naz Reid and KAT. We have the best player in the world. They are not ready for this.

That's the thing about Jayson though. You have to actually watch him play. If all you do is watch SportsCenter highlights and listen to podcasts you can't understand what he's doing. He's not like LeBron or Kobe or Giannis where you can tell 10 seconds that he's the best player on the floor. He wears you down over time.

Watch Jayson 5 minutes: Who the hell is this guy.  He's no superstar and a choker, he can't take over, he has terrible shot selection, and he's bitching about calls on every play. This is the guy you're telling me is the future of basketball?

Watch him for 20 minutes: How did that shot go in? Wait are we just gonna leave beautiful Al Horford open in the corner for him to pass to every time? Why aren't we defending Jayson he's bad we should put people on him!

Watch him for one game: He got lucky so many of his 3s went in. It'll be different next time. He'll fold once someone punches him in the face and the refs won't listen to his crying.

Watch about a month: Holy shit how does anybody ever beat this guy.

This is why he's even better in the playoffs. One game during the regular season sure you can do what you can to hold him in and move on the next day. Having to face him night after night is a nightmare. We're see it series after series by the time these teams get to game 4 or 5 they just look completely cooked.

The Mavericks are soft and the West is a joke. Dallas fans who think they're just gonna walk to a championship are about to find out.

2024-02-14,1707917795,Sat near the Celtics bench last night. Here's what I observed:,"Sat a couple rows back from the court behind the basket and right next to the bench, so I could see the whole bench (tickets were a gift, I'm usually in the nosebleeds). Someone else did a post like this a little while back and I loved it, so thought I'd pay it forward and share some observations from last night:

\- Horford was talking to Tillman for a good 10 minutes, gesticulating, explaining, while Tillman nodded along. Definitely appeared to have a mentor/mentee vibe to it. Although who knows, Horford could have been talking about his favorite restaurants in Boston lol.

\- Springer seemed kind of shy and was the only player who I didn't see talk to anyone. Definitely had a new kid in the class vibe.

\- Porzingis and Queta seem to get along really well. They sat together a lot and were chatting, laughing. 

\- Porzingis is just the chillest guy ever. Fans would scream at him to pay attention to them and he'd nod and wink and give them what they wanted and they'd go wild lol. He just seems like he doesn't get fazed easily. 

\- This is not a team observation, but there was a fan a few rows away from the bench screaming at Tatum ""I need a 40 piece on Fanduel!"" over and over and over again. He was yelling it at the top of the lungs when the arena was kind of quiet. It was definitely within earshot of Tatum. Then he was yelling ""Put Tatum in the game!"" when Tatum was a few points away from 40. I secretly hoped Tatum wouldn't get 40 lol. 

\- My favorite observation of the night: towards the end of the game, the whole bench was standing. A Nets fan a few rows back stood up and yelled at them to sit down (wtf????) and Brissett turned around, looked at her, shook his head, and turned back to the court. She lost her mind, she was so pissed. She  pulled out her phone and started FILMING him. Ummm, miss, what do you plan to do with this ""incriminating"" video exactly? In general, I was kinda shocked at how disrespectful and brazen a lot of fans were.

Best team in the league. Will never sit that close again. It was amazing.",bostonceltics,146,https://www.reddit.com/r/bostonceltics/comments/1aqn1a5/sat_near_the_celtics_bench_last_night_heres_what/

2024-08-01,1722534675,"Celtics star Jaylen Brown, in collaboration with Jrue and Lauren Holiday, is launching Boston XChange, a nonprofit initiative to generate $5 billion in generational wealth in communities of color","After signing a $304 million contract extension last summer, Brown made a pledge to help close the racial wealth gap in Boston. Meet Boston XChange.

Now he is taking the first stepwith the launch of Boston XChange (BXC), a nonprofit initiative to generate $5 billion in generational wealth in communities of color. The NBA Finals MVP has tapped local partners from MIT to the City of Boston to help shape his vision to support entrepreneurs in the so-called creative economy.
BXCs first program kicks off today with applications being accepted for the Boston Creator Incubator + Accelerator. The program, acollaboration with Celtics teammate Jrue Holiday and his wife Laurens JLH Social Impact Fund, will sponsor 10 entrepreneurs in Greater Boston in design, arts, media, entertainment, fashion, and culinary arts.

Boston may be a hub of innovation, but the accelerators and incubators tend to churn out tech and life science companies. Thats what makes Browns concept standout. Partnering with institutions such as MIT, Harvard Business School, and Roxbury Community College, the BXC accelerator offers each entrepreneur up to $100,000 in grant funding over three years, and access to work space and business services valued at more than $150,000. Applications can be found at www.bxchange.org and are due Aug. 15.

But consider that just the tip off to Browns ambitious plan to close the racial wealth gap in Boston  something he hopes people will remember him for as much as his basketball prowess.

With a $304 million contract extension that keeps him on the Celtics through the 2028-29 season, he plans to devote millions of dollars to BXC so, he said, it can be part of my legacy while Im here in Boston.

Whats also exciting is Brown wants to develop a state-of-the-art space to nurture the creative economy. He has been on the hunt for a marquee location in Boston. Think of BXC as part incubator, part maker space with mentoring, coaching, and other resources to help startups succeed.

It will be a hub for diverse creators and entrepreneurs, Brown told me. It will operate kind of at the intersection between business and culture. I believe that when you invest in the creator and the culture, it strengthens entire cities.

Brown said his time in Boston  he was the Celticss top draft pick in 2016  has made him want to address the economic disparities in underserved communities. He cited the Boston Federal Reserve Banks 2015 study that found that non-immigrant Black households in Greater Boston had median net worth of $8.

Brown has already founded one nonprofit, The 7uice Foundation, which aims to bridge the opportunity gap for Black and brown youth. BXC feels bolder. By years end, Brown hopes to lock down a location and launch a search underway for an executive director.

Brown has engaged two consultants: Boston diversity and inclusion strategist Malia Lazu and Kim Tignor, executive director of Take Creative Control, a Washington advocacy group for creators of color.

Over the past two months, they have held listening sessions with a couple dozen local thought leaders and other organizations advancing economic and racial justice, such as the Black Economic Council of Massachusetts, the Mill Cities Community Investments, and the Boston Impact Initiative.

Theyve held these gatherings to get feedback and ideas, and ensure that BXC does not cannibalize the work of existing nonprofits that have long tried to close the racial wealth gap.

One of our goals is to identify gaps and amplify the incredible work thats already taken place, said Brown. We have been building resources for more than a year, but BXC is just getting started, and we cant do it alone.

To that end, BXC also plans to give grants to nonprofits working to reduce economic disparities as a way to strengthen the ecosystem that does this work.

Still, Browns star power can be a game-changer in the quest to make Boston more equitable. Thats not lost on City Hall, whichis working with his team.

Jaylen has been changing the game on and off the court, and we are so blessed in Boston to partner with him once again  now with his visionary leadership setting a national standard for innovation and wealth creation, Boston Mayor Michelle Wu said in a statement. Boston XChange is an example of whats possible when we work together with urgency to create opportunities connecting creators and entrepreneurs to sustainable wealth building that helps our entire community thrive.

For those in Bostons innovation economy, Browns focus on supporting creators of color  the fashion designers, filmmakers, musicians, and video game developers  is what has been missing.

This is a lonely and hard road. You want to meet other people like yourself and a community of mentors and advisors,said Yscaira Jimenez, an MIT lecturer and serial entrepreneur who helped develop BXCs accelerator. For far too long, Boston has had this reputation of being a very segregated city ... We want there to be a true exchange. What does it look like for Roxbury-based creators to be able to grow in downtown Boston and vice versa?

2024 is shaping up to be a banner year for Brown. He collected two MVP titles on his way to helping the Celtics secure Banner 18. Perhaps the best is yet to come with BXC",bostonceltics,65,https://www.reddit.com/r/bostonceltics/comments/1ehn1vw/celtics_star_jaylen_brown_in_collaboration_with/

2024-06-22,1719041744,Brian Scalabrine: Kendrick Perkins excluded from Celtics' access policy for ex-players,"Ahead of the start of this past NBA season, Boston Celtics head coach Joe Mazzulla re-established an open-door policy when it comes to the franchises former players and coaches.

I hope that any and every Celtic feels like they can come to any practice or any game and be a part of that, Mazzulla told NBC Sports Boston at the time.

Well, maybe not every Celtic.

On the heels of Boston securing banner No. 18 with its series-clinching win over the Dallas Mavericks in Game 5 of the NBA Finals, Brian Scalabrine discussed the Celtics open-door policy. And in doing so, the former Boston forward revealed that at least one of his former teammates doesnt seem to be as welcome around the Celtics facility as others are.

Its not really an open arms thing with Kendrick Perkins, Scalabrine said on his SiriusXM show, The Starting Lineup, with Frank Isola.

Scalabrine even went so far as to state that the former Celtics center-turned-ESPN analyst has a big scarlet letter with the franchise.

Originally acquired by Boston via a trade during the 2003 NBA Draft, Perkins spent the first eight seasons of his NBA career with the franchise, serving as the starting center on its championship-winning team in 2008. Following his playing career, the Beaumont, Texas, native has become one of ESPNs highest profile NBA analysts, earning a reputation for his willingness to criticize teams, players and coaches, earning him an unfollow from LeBron James.

That has included the Celtics, with Perkins previously taking aim at star forward Jayson Tatum, who he said looked scared as hell during a game in 2022. More recently, the 14-year NBA veteran was critical of Mazzulla, who he referred to as a birdbrain in January  although its unclear whether that comment came before or after his apparent exile from the franchise.

Unsurprisingly, Perkins wasnt among the former Celtics players to attend Fridays championship parade. That, however, didnt stop ESPN from having a presence at the event, with Jaylen Brown using his wardrobe to take a not-so-subtle shot at Perkins colleague, Stephen A. Smith.",bostonceltics,193,https://www.reddit.com/r/bostonceltics/comments/1dlq9l0/brian_scalabrine_kendrick_perkins_excluded_from/
