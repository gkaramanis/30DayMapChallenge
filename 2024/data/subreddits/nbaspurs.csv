But the last couple of games I'm noticing our guys making the correct plays more and more. Vassell and Sochan are starting to make veteran-reads. And even Malaki and Wesley are looking like their IQ skyrocketed over the course of 3 weeks- Malaki constantly going to his correct spots in a pick and roll or finding Vic better, and Wesley initiating the offense much better. 

I can handle bad shooting because sometimes shots don't go in, but I can't tolerate dumb plays or players and it pissed me off all season. But things look A LOT better recently.

2023-11-06,1699230284,"Thoughts about the team, 6 games in.","1. I think people are overestimating Wembys conditioning, there is a reason that our offense doesnt revolve around Wemby all the time, because being the best defensive player on the court AND handling the main offensive load can be tiring, especially for a 19 y/o rookie. 

2. Sochan as PG can be frustrating at times, but we have to be patient with him. Imagine starting a new job and less than 2 weeks into it, people are already calling you to be replaced. We are not contenders this year, its ok to experiment with Sochan as PG because his potential is higher than Tres. If he even gets as good as Tre then the length alone is enough for the experiment to be successful.



EDIT: Also worth noting, Sochan is only 20!!! Hes less than a year older than Wemby, hes someone that hasnt even played a full regular season of NBA basketball (only 62 games)

3. Were a young team and we need to build chemistry. As a core, we have barely played together. Wemby and Cedi are new, Devin barely played last year. Our oldest player in the starting lineup is Zach Collins at 25 and even he has barely played in the NBA due to injuries. Our oldest vet is Doug, at 31 years old. If Kawhi was on this team, hed be our oldest player. Also the teams focal point offensively has changed as well, the players are not used to having an alien just wandering around the paint, these guys were used to playing with bigs like Jakob or even Eubanks, which is way different than Wemby.

I know its been frustrating as a Spurs fan since we are used to being in the playoffs and all, but I say just enjoy this season and eventually the boys will grow into their potential.",NBASpurs,78,https://www.reddit.com/r/NBASpurs/comments/17oq4ql/thoughts_about_the_team_6_games_in/

2024-06-13,1718238892,Hear me out: The Spurs need to rebuild the French national team.,"We need to find a way to draft Risacher, Saluan, and Dadiet in this draft. Here is why, and how& 

Why: The Spurs were one of the first teams to take international scouting seriously. We built a dynasty with Parker and Ginobili as part of that core, along with other key international contributors. But we have since lost that edge. Now, every team scouts globally and doesnt hesitate to draft a foreign-born player. Whats the next phase in this innovation arch? It seems pretty clear to me& we draft an entire national team.

With Wembanyama as our franchise cornerstone, we have a unique opportunity to essentially REBUILD the French national team, but wearing a Spurs jersey instead of Les Bleus. 

We want to do this because if we can have 5+ French players on our roster, then they will essentially be playing and training with each other year-round. They will also bring so much pride to the game, and will absolutely follow their leader: Victor The Alien Wembanyama. That sort of consistency and determination will unlock an entire new level of game play. Remember the beautiful game from 2014? We can absolutely achieve that level of on court synergy again if more than half of our minutes are going to players that are on the same professional team AND the same national team.

Other benefits: It will help lock in Wemby in San Antonio, because all of his French friends would still be here. Also, they could communicate with each other in French on the court, and that would almost surely create an in-game advantage as non-French players will have no idea what they are saying.

Okay, so now that you agree on the need to draft nothing but French players, the logical next question is: How do we do this?

Theres already chatter that the Spurs are trying to package picks to trade up to #1. We absolutely need to do this so we can draft Risacher. But we cannot give up the #8 pick, because we need that to draft Salaun. Heres my proposal&

Package #4 pick, #48 pick, 2025 Spurs second rounder, and the 2026 pick swap to secure Atlantas 1^(st) in the 2024 draft. Then draft Risacher. His ceiling is a taller Danny Green, which sounds very good to me. 

Then we Draft Salaun at 8. I am hoping that neither Detroit, Charlotte, nor Portland gets cute and decides to draft him ahead of us. If we get a whiff that that may happen, then we will have to explore scenarios to move up and secure Saluan. His ceiling is Aaron Gordon, which sounds very good to me. 

Then, we need to target Pacôme Dadiet. He likely will not be available at 35. So this is how we get him: Package #35 and Charlottes protected 2025 first (more likely, two second rounders from Charlotte) for the Suns pick at 22.

Phoenix does this because they want to draft Bronny James in hopes of luring Lebron. Bronny will likely be available at 35. Also, by signing Bronny to a two-way contract as a second round pick, it helps them tremendously as they navigate salary cap hell (first rounders are guaranteed salary, two-way contracts dont count against the cap). Phoenixs draft chest is completely bare in future years, so the prospect of adding two second rounders from Charlotte should be very appealing.

So with the 22^(nd) pick in the 2024 NBA Draft, the San Antonio Spurs select Pacôme Dadiet&

Now we have Dadiet as a SG, Risacher as a SF, Salaun as a PF, Wemby as a C, and Cissoko as a 6^(th) man.

Then, and finally, we need another tank season so we can draft Nolan Traoré in 2025.

Yes, this plan is brilliant. And Im just going to get ahead of all the Reddit hate: if you disagree with me, then you are wrong.

**The consensus is that you exceeded expectations in your first NBA season. Do you agree with that assessment?**

Not really, no. Maybe I do, but that's not how I feel. Every day, I try to surpass myself, to set new records, to win more games. But the next day, I always tell myself that I haven't done enough, to push myself even harder.

**What are you most proud of in this rookie season with the Spurs?**

There are several things. One of them is my unique statistical lines, especially in wins. Doing things that have never been done before. There's also the fact that I'm the best rookie in most statistical categories, and the best counter-attacker in the League.

**What's the most important thing you've learned after 71 games in the NBA?**

The main thing I've learned is the consistency I've seen from the top ten players, like (Joel) Embiid, (Nikola) Jokic and Giannis (Antetokounmpo). They play every game, all season long, and rarely have a bad night. They don't just shine occasionally, it's not enough.

**These players were always complimenting you after playing against you this season. Were you touched?**

First of all, I'm glad it wasn't the other way around (laughs). It reminds me that I'm on the right track. I always appreciate it when guys I grew up watching and admiring recognize my talent.

**You're in competition with your compatriot Rudy Gobert (Minnesota) for the title of Defender of the Year. Do you still have a chance of winning it?**

We'll have to see. It would be far from a steal if Rudy got it. However, I think a lot has changed since the start of the season. In any case, it was a great fight. What satisfies me most is to have two Frenchmen at the top of the ranking.

**And the title of rookie of the year?**

The results will show whether I did what I had to do to get it, but I think so. In any case, I have no regrets about that. So that means I did the right thing.

**On an individual level, your season has been marked by numerous highlights, those spectacular actions that have made the rounds on social networks. Is that important to you?**

I like highlights, yes. For me, highlights are like art, like dance. In warm-up, I'm always trying out new dunks, new techniques, sometimes things I didn't think I was capable of. It's really a world to explore.

**At what point are you already a complete player, close to your best level in the NBA?**

It's hard to say. I think that in terms of evolution between my first game and my ""prime"" (his peak), I'm at 15% of my abilities today.

**Collectively, the Spurs ended the season with 60 setbacks, sometimes stringing together heavy losing streaks. How do you cope emotionally at times like these?**

There was a time when it was pretty hard to lose all those games. Especially when you had to go back the next day or two and take on the big boys again (laughs). But that was also the point. If it hadn't been mentally and physically draining, it would have meant that I hadn't challenged myself enough.

**You've already mentioned your all-consuming passion for basketball. How much has it helped you through the adversity of this season?**

There were times after games when I was so tired that I almost fainted. It was very hard, I couldn't move. But I tried to remind myself every time how lucky I am to be here, and that it's not going to last forever. There are millions of people who would love to be in my shoes, so I'm obliged to make the most of it and enjoy it.

**Your first NBA season is now over. What's your schedule for the next few weeks?**

I'm going to stay in San Antonio for a few days for the end-of-year medical tests, continue training and then head back to France. I don't know which day yet, but it's going to happen very quickly. Unfortunately, I'll be there for less than three weeks.

**After ten months in the USA, how much do you miss your homeland? And what's the first thing you're going to do when you get back?**

I've been looking forward to going back for some time now. I'm going to visit my grandparents, whom I haven't seen since I left. I'm also going to meet up with my brother, and I'd love to go and see some of his games. My sister too. I also miss food. Maybe I'll go for a Greek? That wouldn't be bad (laughs).

**After your individual exploits with Spurs this season, what kind of welcome do you expect in France?**

I don't know about that. I still have the feeling that basketball is still very much a closed sphere, and not as mainstream as it is in the United States. But maybe I'm wrong. And frankly, I can't wait to see what it's like when I get back. I don't really know what to expect.

**You will then return to the United States to prepare for the Olympic Games this summer with Les Bleus. What will your physical preparation look like? You recently spoke of the need to put on more muscle and thicken up.**

There are very few players, I think, whose aim is not to get stronger physically. Let's just say that we're not going to do anything revolutionary. We're going to continue with what's working and build on our momentum. There's no reason to break that continuity, in fact, and the weight gain will come naturally.

**How much do you look forward to being in Paris at the end of July, representing your country at the Olympic Games?**

It's going to be huge. When I'm out there, I'm going to give 200%, as I do every time I wear this jersey. It's going to be extraordinary, and I'll be there, like a child, enjoying the moment.",NBASpurs,18,https://www.reddit.com/r/NBASpurs/comments/1c4g35b/wemby_to_french_media_long_interview_there_were/

Add in Beal and that total goes up to 91. I'm not criticizing their performance since I didn't watch the game, but I don't think I could stand watching a team that needs two guys to put up over 80 points just to have a chance at winning a basketball game. Just makes me wonder what the hell the rest of the team was doing.

I know big scoring nights can be great to watch every once in a while, but games like this one make me appreciative of the system that the Spurs have built where sharing the ball and getting everyone involved in scoring is the way they try to win games.

I'd honestly hate it if the only way the Spurs could win games was if Wemby had to score 50 and Vassell had to score 30. In this past season, even though wins were rare, the ones the team did get didn't usually require Wemby going nuclear. Instead, they usually came as a result of making good passes, hitting open shots, and executing plays well.

I have high hopes for this team and I think they'll deliver next season.",NBASpurs,59,https://www.reddit.com/r/NBASpurs/comments/1cfr3jv/suns_make_me_appreciate_the_spurs_more/

The crazy part about this is that he was only at 1.39 blocks per foul on February 11. Wemby proceeded to finish the season with 111 blocks to just 50 fouls (2.22 blocks per foul) in his last 24 games.

After his debut vs. the Mavs, it seemed like he was hardly ever in foul trouble. He did a great job staying down on fakes and picking his spots in situations where preventing the basket was unlikely.

&gt;Popovich, who addressed the media before Wembanyama spoke to reporters, was asked if the Frenchman is getting close to having the restriction lifted.  
&gt;  
&gt;The coach said it would be lifted only after an examination.  
&gt;  
&gt;""In a certain amount of time, we will take more pictures and that will determine whether the minutes thing changes or not,"" Popovich said. ""It is the same (number of minutes) every night. I think we were a minute off tonight. Twenty-four minutes is the deal.""

2024-02-12,1707756147,[Stein] Rival teams were left with the impression that Dejounte Murray staying and Trae Young being traded away will be a legitimate option for the Hawks in the off-season. The San Antonio Spurs would be atop the list of suitors for Trae Young.,"Source: https://marcstein.substack.com/p/the-trae-trade-watch-has-commenced

&gt; I can tell you this much: They've certainly convinced various rival teams that a Dejounte In/Trae Out course is going to be legitimately considered.

&gt; San Antonio tops the perceived list. The Spurs have circulated for months among prominent league observers as a viable destination for Young's offensive gifts. In Victor Wembanyama, they also seemingly possess precisely the sort of long and rangy defensive anchor who could mitigate Young's defensive deficiencies. It is likewise believed in some corners of the league that Young would have interest in South Texas as a destination if he were forced to leave Atlanta.

&gt; The Los Angeles Lakers could wind up on there, too. They have an All-NBA defensive anchor of their own in Anthony Davis and, after declining to make a major move at the deadline, are poised to have three first-round picks at their trade disposal starting on draft night (2029 and 2031 in addition to 2024 or 2025 depending on how New Orleans decides to settle the last obligation remaining from the original AD trade) to make a splashy move on June 26 or thereafter.",NBASpurs,110,https://www.reddit.com/r/NBASpurs/comments/1ap4ccc/stein_rival_teams_were_left_with_the_impression/

FiveThirtyEight covered the reasons for the frequent appearances [back in 2019](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/why-are-there-so-many-bats-at-spurs-games/) when it was at its peak (3x in a year); the TLDR being that (1) the stadium is in the middle of a migration path and (2) is often an easy warm refuge during the cold months.

2024-01-15,1705361976,"Sochan hate before, now Devin hate? Relax, think about the big picture","I know its been said again and again, but - PATFO has made it clear that this season is about experimenting. This is the first season we have Wemby, were trying to create an entirely new system, and Pop is still observing. For example if he wanted to maximize wins he wouldve started Tre from the beginning, but instead he did the Sochan experiment which, resulted in lots of growing pains but we can see now that Sochan is confident pushing the ball up, can distribute better, and has been a solid contributor more recently in his forward role.

We all obviously know Wemby is our future. But no all time great has ever changed a bottom three team within one season, or done it without other star level talent - this shit is gonna take time. Is winning a few games now worth hating on our young guys every time they have an off game? Do we really think 4th year Devin, after not even having a full healthy year as the go to scorer, is gonna go Kobe with our team?

Plus, if theres anything to be learned about the recent young phenoms like Luka, Trae, etc is that a team that goes full into win now mode with a young superstar is gonna go nowhere fast. Both the Hawks and Mavs have peaked at second round exits. Its way worth it now to tank, and pair Wemby with a Nikola Topic/Sarr level talent, rather than surround him with bunch of veterans and picks in the teens with limited potential. 

Lets enjoy the development for now, and I truly believe were going to be contenders sooner than it may look like now.",NBASpurs,45,https://www.reddit.com/r/NBASpurs/comments/197nslf/sochan_hate_before_now_devin_hate_relax_think/

2024-03-11,1710130627,Victor Wembanyama Keeps Losing. The NBA Is Still Terrified.,"The San Antonio Spurs are unequivocally one of the worst teams in the NBA. Theyve lost more than three times as many games as theyve won. Theyre one of only two teams mathematically eliminated from the playoffs. Theyre on pace to finish dead last in the Western Conference for the second year in a row.

But to the biggest names in the NBA, the Spurs dont look like doormats. They look completely terrifying.

The reason is a 7-foot-4 phenom from France who puts his phone on airplane mode at 9 p.m. to read before bed.

Victor Wembanyama hasnt merely lived up to the hype that followed him across the Atlantic in June, when he was the most heralded No. 1 draft pick since LeBron James. Hes convinced the NBAs best players, including James himself, that hes ready to take over the leagueand sooner rather than later.

He doesnt have a ceiling, James said of Wembanyama, who is still just 20 years old. He can do whatever he wants to do with his career.

James made his comment after the rookie stuffed every category of the stat sheet against the Los Angeles Lakers: 27 points, 10 rebounds, eight assists, five steals and five blocks. 

Wembanyama had also tallied five steals and blocks the game before, becoming the first player to reach that threshold in back-to-back contests since another heralded young star did so in 1987. His name was Michael Jordan.

Wembanyama plays nothing like James or Jordan. In many ways, thats the point. He plays like nothing like anyone who has come before him. 

The rest of the NBA has spent this season getting accustomed to a giant who, under the guidance of legendary coach Gregg Popovich, collects new skills as easily as he changes a lightbulb. He shoots 3-pointers more often and with a higher hit rate than either James or Jordan did as rookies. With his 8-foot wingspan, he dunks from more outrageous distances. And his defense is already in a class of its own: Wembanyama leads the NBA with 3.4 blocks per game and is in the running for the Defensive Player of the Year award.

Wembanyamas statistics tell only part of the story. The NBAs superstar class tells the rest. A kid who cant yet legally partake of Popovichs famously refined wine selections simply shouldnt be doing the things hes done, says the list of icons who have lately gone up against him.

In January, Wembanyama had a bruising back-and-forth with Giannis Antetokounmpo of the Milwaukee Bucks, at one point rejecting the two-time MVPs shot. At All-Star weekend in February, Antetokounmpo licked his wounds and offered praise.
Theres never going to be anyone else like him, said the 6-foot-11 Bucks star. People dont understand. Hes like 7-5. I was standing next to him. Hes way, way, way taller than me. He can shoot, he can dribbleblah, blah, blah.

The problem for the Spurs is that the lousiness that let them win last years draft lottery and land Wembanyama hasnt lifted. None of his teammates has appeared on so much as a single All-Star roster, meaning Wembanyamas performances often feel like scintillating trailers for a yet-to-be-released blockbuster. According to Player Efficiency Rating, Wembanyama is already the 14th-most valuable player in the entire NBA.

The next-closest Spur? Devin Vassell. He was 82nd on the list, entering Saturday.
In an odd way, the lack of help on the roster has only underlined Wembanyamas bona fides. Opposing defenses focus their game plans on stopping him, and still he has burst right through the fabled rookie wall, scoring nearly four more points per game after the calendar flipped to 2024 than before.

Hes got a target on his back. Theyre going to come after him, theyre going to be physical, Popovich said, adding, Hes learning every night.

Only one person in professional basketball, it seems, is unimpressed by Wembys rookie season. That would be Wemby himself. 
After matching Jordans defensive feat, he wondered if Jordans numbers came in victories or defeats. He hoped he could look back and think this is a good performance, he said. As of today, I cant be satisfied with a loss.

The players who have spent a generation gobbling up championships are quite certain he wont have to be satisfied with losing for much longer, as he matures and the Spurs build around him. In the meantime, those established stars appreciate their good fortune to be playing now, not later.

Its just insane how dominant hes going to be as he gets more comfortable in the game, 35-year-old Phoenix Suns star Kevin Durant said last month. Luckily, Im on my way out, so I wont have to deal with it too much.",NBASpurs,18,https://www.reddit.com/r/NBASpurs/comments/1bbuj9x/victor_wembanyama_keeps_losing_the_nba_is_still/

)

No one believed Wemby when he motioned for Pop to challenge this call. The announcers kept making comments about how it was obviously a foul. 

Then to make this moment even crazier -  *they* reviewed the play and determined the foul stands. Pop still trustede Vic enough to use his challenge because he could tell it meant a lot to him, even after they had reviewed the play and said the foul stands. 

Then not only did they overrule the original call, but they overruled the actual review as well.

This just felt like a great moment for our =} guy. It's good to see him get wins where he can.

Pops face during that was so classic

2024-05-08,1715190592,Butterfly Effect: Wemby is the reason the Nuggets don't repeat.,"Seeing the Nuggets struggle so much these first two Rounds, really puts into perspective how much Wemby's 17 Points in three minutes explosion during our penultimate game, completely derailed the Nuggets championship chances by denying them the 1. seed.

At the time the Nuggets after the All-Star break, were pretty clearly the best team in the league imo and were obviously aiming for the 1. seed, so losing to us not only cost them the 1. seed, but really chipped at their mental toughness, which outside of Murrays injury and play, is absolutely the biggest difference between whoever the championship Nuggets were and this playoff's Nuggets are.

And on top of this they were forced to play a fairly tough Lebron and AD led team in a series, which really only finished in 5 games due to Murray's injury not affecting his clutch gene in the slightest. And now, having to face their, in my opinion toughest matchup out of any possible Playoff team, right when they are at their lowest.

When instead they could've cruised past a Zion-less Pelicans, faced a hobbled Mavs team in the second round and just had to battle whoever would've survived the bloodbath that is be the other Western Semifinals, likely being either OKC or Timberwolves, in the Western Finals.

So having tried to bully and provoke Wemby in Game 81 of the regular season, inadvertently awakened the wrath of his Alien Plot Armor and resulted in the defending champions, the Denver Nuggets, having barely any chance at repeating.",NBASpurs,53,https://www.reddit.com/r/NBASpurs/comments/1cnarch/butterfly_effect_wemby_is_the_reason_the_nuggets/

2024-07-16,1721119849,[The Ringer] Gregg Popovich will have a hard time keeping Stephon Castle off the floor.,"One of the pleasures of being an NBA elitist is getting the chance to introduce fresh new faces to the broader basketball world, so let me be the first to report that *Stephon Castle is pretty awesome.* There was simply no way to know this about one of the best players on the best team in college basketball last season because the only true crucible is summer leaguethe purest version of the game, spared from distractions like order and game plan and on-court chemistry. We can see the truth of Castles game in a glorified AAU tournament and, better yet, the single game of a glorified AAU tournament, before Castle withdrew from competition in Vegas with a wrist injury.

But what a game it was. Even in the summer league slop, Castle is an engine for intuitive, winning plays, connecting dots that lesser prospects wouldnt see and manifesting plays that lesser athletes couldnt create. The questions about Castles shot and position are inevitable, but those are almost beside the point; whats most striking about watching him play against quasi-pros is realizing how difficult it will be to take him off the floor in the earliest days of his career. Why would the Spurs deprive themselves of a guard who comes by impact plays so naturally? Throw Castle into the mix and see what he can turn up, whether by jamming opponents up at the point of attack or slicing his way through the defense. Toolsy, theoretical players are fun and all, but so are the dudes who make shit happen almost incidentally, as if it were an entire way of life. *Rob Mahoney*

&gt;ClutchPoints asked the third-year Spur if, in fact, he expects to be moved by Thursday's trade deadline.  
&gt;  
&gt;I think that's something my agent and I will talk about, obviously. Shooting's at a premium in this league and I know I can do it with the best of them but, at the same time, I love being here. I love being with this young team. I think there's a lot of potential in the future here and it's awesome to be a part of, McDermott said.  
&gt;  
&gt;Whatever happens happens. It's always good to be wanted in this league and it just shows you're doing your job a a high level. That's all I can focus on right now is just continuing to try and make my threes and be a good teammate and everything else will happen on its own.  
&gt;  
&gt;The Spurs may not get an offer they like for McDermott. Should that happen, pulling the trigger on a trade would be tough to take for fans, especially considering the former Creighton star doesn't want to leave San Antonio.  
&gt;  
&gt;It's my favorite place I've lived for sure, by far. And I've lived in some pretty big cities. Just the people, the organization, just all align with each other, McDermott said.  
&gt;  
&gt;There's no BS here, which I really like and I can just focus on becoming a better basketball player, a better person and, at this stage of my career, that's kind of what I'm striving to be: a better leader. If I want to get into coaching or the front office or whatever comes next, there's no better place than here. Regardless of what happens, I've enjoyed my time here and I would love to be here forever.  
&gt;  
&gt;The Spurs have several young players NBA rivals may find intriguing. Such deals may get complicated. A potential McDermott trade could prove simpler because he's a smart shooter who wouldn't command multiple first-round draft picks.  
&gt;  
&gt;Everyone's a little anxious, the 10-year veteran said about Thursday's trade deadline.  
&gt;  
&gt;It's different here when we've got a young team. A lot of these guys are draft picks and guys who are developing, so maybe a little bit less of that. But for myself and some of older guys, we've been through it so many times where we know that anything can happen. We'd like to stay here. It's a great spot to be but we also know that they've got to look out for the franchise and if that means trading, you can't control it.  
&gt;  
&gt;As the Spurs field, or make, expected calls about some of the players on their roster, McDermott is ready for what may come next.  
&gt;  
&gt;It's hard to block out the noise. I don't get on social media or any of that stuff so I don't really hear much of it anyway, he said.  
&gt;  
&gt;The one day of the year my phone's on ring is the trade deadline day. Otherwise, it's on silent so if I get a call I know probably something happened. It's a blessing to be in this league, regardless of what team your one, wherever you're at. I've gotten traded so many times that I've enjoyed all the people I've met throughout the journey.  
&gt;  
&gt;San Antonians hope that if McDermott's dealt, it's because the Spurs received an offer worthy of parting with a man who's come to love their city.

2024-07-21,1721582400,Jeremy already got three 30+point games in his NBA career despite still being very raw offensive player.,"I think it's interesting that he showed flashes early that he can get these 30-point games while being so raw offensively.

Vassell got his first 30-point games this past season (got 6 of them tho). His first 3 seasons he got none.

You know how many 30-point games Draymond Green has got all career? THREE !! And none of those came from that season when Steph and Klay out all season.

I watched Jeremy played those 2 games for Poland and thought maybe he can become a better scorer than expectations?

2024-01-29,1706520885,Wemby overtakes Chet.,"Wemby has [officially](https://dunksandthrees.com/epm) overtaken Chet in EPM, which is widely regarded as the best publicly available impact metric, as Wemby's rating is a +3.9 vs Chet's +3.8, and given the current trend, I'd expect the gap to only grow larger. This also makes Wemby the second best rookie in the recorded history of EPM (which dates back to 2014), only behind Jokic, who was also a redshirt rookie, and who did not play nearly as many minuted as Wemby, thus likely boosting his +/-.
I wonder if advanced stats lover JJ Redick will acknowledge that.
Also, he's been shooting [39.1%](https://www.nba.com/stats/players/pullup?CF=PULL_UP_FG3A*GE*1.7&amp;dir=D&amp;sort=PULL_UP_FG3_PCT) on pull-up threes on 1.7 attempts per game for the entire season, which makes him the 9th best shooter at that volume or higher in the entire league.",NBASpurs,64,https://www.reddit.com/r/NBASpurs/comments/1adrfwe/wemby_overtakes_chet/

2023-12-12,1702415128,"Rebuilding/tanking isn't fun or convenient, so stop watching or stop crying","I know this is hard for some of you to hear, but the legendary *Spurs Way* doesn't mean we're entitled to skip the ugly parts of rebuilding. 

The front page of this sub is filled with the cries of petulant children who are passive-aggressively suggesting we make franchise altering changes because they're upset they spent $70 on league pass to watch a bunch of L's. The amount of people suggesting that we fire key members of the Front Office (or freaking Pop) because we're not winning enough **in a tanking season** is absurd.

Here's the only thing you need to understand: 

ALL OF YOU embraced the tank last year. **Every single one of you**. We just landed the biggest prospect since Lebron. Maybe nobody told you this, but tanking and rebuilding is not a one-year process. It is a multiple year process, and we are still in the front half of that process. And it sucks. And it's not convenient. 

Does losing almost 20 games in a row blow? Of course. Is this part of the plan? Probably not. But that's just how reality works, guys. This is the trade off of being bad enough to land a generational talent. You don't get to decide to be bad enough to land Wemby, but also good enough to just grab a quick win whenever people get restless. That's literally not how anything works. That's a child's view of the world. 

I'm going to guess most of you weren't here 3-years ago when the prevailing sentiment was that we were **SO SICK AND TIRED** of finishing as a 7-8 seed and missing out on good draft picks just to get crushed in the first round. The fans almost unanimously wanted the team to go all-in on a rebuild, and we did. 

Well guess what, y'all. This is rebuilding. We're doing it right now. This is what you asked for, and we're doing it, and there's no turning back. So enjoy the ride, or get off until you can stop crying so the rest of us can hear the game.

* Do ticket prices generally drop the day or two leading up to the game (I assume so but wasn't sure if SA was any different).

2024-03-13,1710306354,"[Osborne] Gregg Popovich holds Spurs' rebuild plans close to vest as Victor Wembanyama's rookie season nears home stretch. ""I don't pretend to know what we're going to do,"" said Popovich. Whether it's money in the bank or draft picks or being creative trade-wise. All those things are on the table.""","[https://www.expressnews.com/sports/spurs/article/popovich-spurs-rebuild-victor-wembanyama-18939581.php](https://www.expressnews.com/sports/spurs/article/popovich-spurs-rebuild-victor-wembanyama-18939581.php)

&gt;Spurs coach Gregg Popovich didn't tip his hand when asked Tuesday about the team's personnel plans beyond this season.  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;The coaching staff and front office are seeking clarity in the final five weeks of the season regarding which players from the NBA's youngest squad will be retained as part of the club's rebuild.  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;""We all have opinions every day, coaches meet every day,"" Popovich said before watching the Spurs lose 103-101 to Houston to fall to 14-52. ""We talk about that sort of thing along with everything else. So when the season ends, we'll sit down with management and have that discussion. But whether it's a young team or an older team, every team has that discussion. Changes are made every year. That just goes with the territory.""  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;The Spurs, who will miss the playoffs for a club-record fifth straight season, are looking closely at how several players on the roster fit with rookie star Victor Wembanyama. The 7-foot-3 center is the franchise cornerstone after the Spurs drafted him No. 1 overall last June following their lottery win.  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;With Wembanyama the favorite to win rookie of the year, Popovich was asked if the 20-year-old Frenchman's rapid development has sped up the team's rebuilding plans.  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;""I don't pretend to know what we're going to do,"" said Popovich, who also serves as the club's president of basketball operations. ""We have a lot of possibilities ahead of us, whether it's money in the bank or draft picks or being creative trade-wise. All those things are on the table. But aren't they for every team? I don't know why we're any different. We're just younger.""  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;One thing is certain: Popovich and general manager Brian Wright don't expect to feel any pressure from Spurs managing partner Peter J. Holt.  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;""If your organization is unable to understand that rebuilding takes time, then you just never get there,"" Popovich said. ""Were fortunate because weve always had under the leadership of the Holt family the ability to do what we think has been best. So were always grateful for that.""

2024-02-06,1707242866,Victor Wembanyama is mounting a pretty ******* good case for Defensive Player of the Year [OC Analysis],"\[Hey, everyone! This was originally meant for a general NBA audience, so forgive some of the obvious ""no duh"" stuff for Spurs fans. Hope you enjoy!\]

I have never seen a player improve as rapidly at something as Victor Wembanyama has improved at NBA defense.

Not that he was bad to start  hes been good since day one! Wembanyama flashed his court-guzzling defensive prowess right from the preseason, gobbling up entire possessions like a basketball [Galactus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galactus): \[[video here](https://www.basketballpoetry.com/p/should-victor-wembanyama-be-defensive)\]

But theres a difference between having a good season and having an all-time great season. Hes closing in on the latter.

A few weeks ago, I said that defensively, Wembanyama couldve [swept last years Oscars](https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/movies/movie-news/everything-everywhere-all-at-once-wins-7-oscars-2023-1235349378/): hes everything, everywhere, all at once. That may have understated his impact.

*\[Hi, all! As always, I've collected a whole bunch of video clips for this one. They can be* [*viewed in-context here*](https://www.basketballpoetry.com/p/should-victor-wembanyama-be-defensive)*. I think they add a lot to the post, so check them out!\]*

Wembys 3.1 blocks per game lead the association, and his 1.2 steals per game are 19th in the league (hes the only center in the top 20, although Nikola Jokic is right behind him). Nobody comes close to those combined numbers no matter how you regularize them (although, shout out to Andre Drummond, an old-school center [leading the league in per-possession steals](https://www.basketball-reference.com/leagues/NBA_2024_per_poss.html), and Walker Kessler, who slightly edges Wemby in blocks per possession). For what its worth, the Spurs recover [66% of Wembys blocks](https://www.pbpstats.com/totals/nba/player?Season=2023-24&amp;SeasonType=Regular%2BSeason), the top mark of the most prolific shotblockers (by a fraction of a fraction over fellow rookie Chet Holmgren, having an All-Defensive-caliber season of his own).

Notably, hes blocking all these shots without getting into foul trouble: his [minuscule 2.9% foul rate](https://cleaningtheglass.com/stats/player/5213#tab-defense_rebounding) compares favorably to Rudy Gobert, Holmgren, Brook Lopez, and most other elite big-man defenders you can name  and thats as a rookie! Newbie bigs almost always struggle with foul trouble as they navigate the complexities of NBA-level pick-and-roll defense. Instead, we have Wemby toying with ballhandlers and doing stuff like this: \[[video here](https://www.basketballpoetry.com/p/should-victor-wembanyama-be-defensive)\]

If thats too basic for your tastes, the alphabet stew all-in-one stats are just as kind as the traditional metrics. For players with at least 500 minutes played, he currently ranks [sixth in D-EPM](https://dunksandthrees.com/epm), [third in Bball-Indexs D-LEBRON](https://www.bball-index.com/leaderboards-tool/), and seventh in Neil Paines defensive [eRAPTOR](https://neilpaine.substack.com/p/nba-estimated-raptor-player-ratings). While all of those acronyms have various strengths and weaknesses, Wembanyama and Knicks backup center Isaiah Hartenstein (performing fantastically in Mitchell Robinsons absence) are the only players in the league to be top-10 in all three. If *every* directional indicator points the same way, you can feel better about the conclusion.

And remember that Wemby played much of the season out of position and is still surrounded by nervous-matador teammates. These dudes are dying on screens like randy teens in a slasher flick. How does Wembanyama cope when this is what hes faced with every game? \[[video here](https://www.basketballpoetry.com/p/should-victor-wembanyama-be-defensive)\]

The breakdown: Malaki Branham is one of the worst defenders in basketball. Setting a screen essentially hits the delete button on Branham for any given possession, as you see above (its hilarious that Branham flips his hands up as if hes frustrated by his teammates). Julian Champagnie is usually better but misses his job this time. Hes supposed to tag the rolling big man by bumping him to make the roll to the rim more difficult. Instead, like my toddler helping with the chores, neither of those players does anything remotely useful. Wemby is put into an untenable 2-on-1 situation that ends in an easy alley-oop for Bismack Biyombo.

This happens *all the time*. Further proof: when Wembanyama is resting, the Spurs [give up 124 points per 100 possessions](https://cleaningtheglass.com/stats/team/27/lineups?off=5213#tab-four_factors), an awful figure. For context, the Clippers have the best offensive rating in league history right now, and [theyre cracking 122 points per 100.](https://cleaningtheglass.com/stats/league/fourfactors)

In other words, whenever Wemby folds himself onto a tiny bench chair, the Spurs transform opposing offenses into the Dream Team. But the [Spurs give up fewer than 115 points per 100](https://cleaningtheglass.com/stats/player/5213/lineups#tab-four_factors) when Wembys on the floor, a slightly above-average mark. He transforms one of the worst defenses in the league into something more than respectable.

Thats primarily due to scaring the shi\*t out of opposing ballhandlers. Hes in the [98th percentile for reducing opponent shots at the rim](https://cleaningtheglass.com/stats/player/5213/onoff#tab-opp_shooting_freq), and teams shoot less accurately when they do get there, too. [Opponents shoot just 52% at the rim](https://www.nba.com/stats/players/defensive-impact?CF=DEF_RIM_FGA*GE*50&amp;dir=A&amp;sort=DEF_RIM_FG_PCT) against Wembanyama, the same mark as Rudy Gobert, and according to Second Spectrum, [Wembanyama lowers the probability of an opponents shot converting](https://twitter.com/Adam_Mares/status/1754745764813685189) by a greater percentage than anyone in the NBA.

Statistically, theres a powerful argument that Wembys the best defender in the NBA right now, and many of those same numbers have only gotten better since the first month-ish of the season (give or take a midseason minutes restriction).

I know that was a metric ton of metrics, so lets turn to the tape. Film shows the improvement. Coming into the season, a knock on Wemby was that he was too easy to shift off-balance, and his hips were slow to turn. This outrageous deflection would beg otherwise: \[[video here](https://www.basketballpoetry.com/p/should-victor-wembanyama-be-defensive)\]

Look how quickly he spins and re-locates the pass to knock it away! Few big men are that quick to react.

Wemby can change his orientation with startling alacrity. And like the best shot-blockers, hes not scared to get yammed on. You dont average three blocks by regularly making business decisions: \[[video here](https://www.basketballpoetry.com/p/should-victor-wembanyama-be-defensive)\]

Wembanyama is not some lumbering oaf bound to the paint like Mona Lisa, either. He skitters across the court, arms wide like some nightmarish shot-eating crab. Chris Paul learned this the hard way when he tried to get to his pet pull-up from the right elbow to end a quarter, only to panic and fling the ball at the rafters when Wemby apparated in front of him: \[[video here](https://www.basketballpoetry.com/p/should-victor-wembanyama-be-defensive)\]

Wembanyama is still learning, but his margin for error is like playing a video game in story mode. Here, he falls for an initial shoulder fake by Scoot Henderson but gets the block anyway: \[[video here](https://www.basketballpoetry.com/p/should-victor-wembanyama-be-defensive)\]

At the beginning of the season, Wembanyama struggled with the timing of when to help and when to stay home. Hed chase blocks he could not get, then watch a driver go right by him without offering much resistance. But hes starting to find the balance. Hes singlehandedly destroying possessions by himself. Watch as he stonewalls Giannis Antetokounmpo, then Lopez, then Lopez again, then Giannis for good measure: \[[video here\]](https://www.basketballpoetry.com/p/should-victor-wembanyama-be-defensive)

Not many defenders can absorb a full-speed Giannis shoulder and live to tell the tale, much less become the hero: \[[video here](https://www.basketballpoetry.com/p/should-victor-wembanyama-be-defensive)\]

The biggest players can still mash Wembanyama under the basket, but hes far stronger than he looks, and he's willowy enough to absorb the blow but still alter shots.

The scary thing is that there are clear areas for further refinement. Wembanyama tends to close out really high on shooters. It certainly dissuades them from launching, but it can take him completely out of the play (and few Spurs can be counted on to provide much help): \[[video here](https://www.basketballpoetry.com/p/should-victor-wembanyama-be-defensive)\]

Wemby occasionally misses box-outs, relying upon his tree branches to corral rebounds. Hes only been so-so in isolation defense, as hes a little jumpy (although that, too, is advancing). He throws himself off-balance at times by trying for kick balls, a weird habit you cant stop noticing once you see it (although anecdotally, I do think hes been less prone to soccer of late; I wonder if coach Pop told him to cut it out): \[[video here](https://www.basketballpoetry.com/p/should-victor-wembanyama-be-defensive)\]

And while Im not sure this is actually a negative thing, Wemby is a big proponent of the Kornet Kontest. If Im a Spurs fan, Id prefer he holster any unnecessary jumping. Watch him swat an invisible fly at the top of this clip: \[[video here](https://www.basketballpoetry.com/p/should-victor-wembanyama-be-defensive)\]

(Hes not even in between the shooter and the basket! I giggle every time I watch this video. Then again, the shot didnt go in&)

Those are real knocks, if understandable, given his age. And if the season ended *right now*, Rudy Gobert would be the deserving Defensive Player of the Year  Ive waxed rhapsodic about his resurgence several times since January last season. But the trendline of Wembanyamas defensive performance looks like a lower-case L, and thats not an exaggeration: \[[picture here](https://www.basketballpoetry.com/p/should-victor-wembanyama-be-defensive)\]

Further improvement is not guaranteed, of course. Teams are scheming to keep Wemby out of their plays, and the rookie wall is a real threat. [Allergies](https://twitter.com/HectorLedesmaTV/status/1754020788309508267?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1754020788309508267%7Ctwgr%5E3e37ddbc756ef2146794dc72740403ac6e4bff15%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fclutchpoints.com%2Fspurs-news-victor-wembanyama-not-immune-infamous-south-texas-allergies) might be his greatest threat. But theres a solid chance that Wembanyama is the most deserving Defensive Player of the Year candidate by seasons end  and it might not be close.

The question, then, is whether voters will give it to him. If he wins DPOY as a rookie, it will be hard *not* to give it to him for much of the next decade, barring injuries. Defensive Player of the Year is less prone to voting fatigue and contextual narratives than MVP. Dikembe Mutombo won it four times in seven years, Ben Wallace four times in five seasons, and Dwight Howard three-peated. More recently, Gobert won it three times in four years (and might add a fourth in seven this season). And Wembanyama wont be *worse* at defense than he is right now.

Its impossible to predict what the league will look like in future seasons with any degree of certainty. And I dont think voters will be willing to give DPOY to a rookie, no matter what the numbers say, particularly one toiling like a 74 Sisyphus on a basement-dwelling team. But Im increasingly convinced that they should.",NBASpurs,26,https://www.reddit.com/r/NBASpurs/comments/1akg70k/victor_wembanyama_is_mounting_a_pretty_good_case/

Adrian Wojnarowski said that the San Antonio Spurs would like to take it slow and draft high in 2024 and 2025, but Victor Wembanyama's recent level of play has had front office executives wondering if they should ""rush"" the process and get him help now.

Brian Windhorst doubts the San Antonio Spurs will end up doing this because they don't want to end up like the Houston Rockets who gave up picks and were big spenders this past Summer only to move up from being one of the worst teams in the league to being the 12th seed.

Manu: It's hard to tell, but we hope and believe that now with Victor and this upcoming draft, that we're gonna have two top tens. In two/three years, we can be out there contending. I don't know if being favorited, but being in the playoffs and being good.

2024-07-24,1721825750,"I came here for Jakob Pöltl, I stayed for ...the Spurs!","This is a bit of a Spurs appreciation post I guess, so hear me out.

I was a huge NBA fan in my early teenager years mid 90s. All my friends collected cards like crazy and I was no exception. I even got some nice Tim Duncan rookie cards btw. Don't ask me why, but for some reason the Pacers were my team back then (it must have been Rick Smits magnificent hair). I may add that I am located in Austria, where US sports is popular, but still in a bit of a niche.

So anyways, my interest faded and basically vanished and only came back much much later when Jakob Pöltl, a fellow Austrian, entered the league. Initially I sporadically followed the Raptors and esp. Jakobs stats.

The trade to the Spurs came to a time where I was on a business trip in the US and I had the chance to watch a game on TV. It was [this game](https://www.basketball-reference.com/boxscores/201812070SAS.html) btw. I started to follow Jakob and the Spurs more closely, I joined this fine sub (with my old account that I deleted during the Reddit protests last year), followed game threads and all the discussions. Heck I even made some Jakob memes a couple of times. Unfortunatelly I didn't do a backup so they were deleted with my old account, but it was something along the lines of ""you just lost to a turtle"".

Anyways, later in 2019 my son was born wich meant one thing: sleepless nights. When I was dead awake in the middle of the night I started to watch Spurs games. I guess I don't need to explain the Spurs timeline to you, but... the Spurs lost a lot. And this meant some time for Lonnie and Chimezie, who I liked to call ""garbage time boys"". Sunburnt Jakob and the one game against the Rockets (Lonnie with the 3 and Jakob with the block against Harden) were some of the highlights from that period.

When Jakob was traded to the Raptors, I thought this would be a goodbye, but... once a Spur, always a Spur I guess?  
I kept following you, check the boxscore after each game, kept lurking around in this sub. I thought I'd switch to the Raptors sub but honestly, it was quite boring there.

Fast forward: Wemby happened. I was stoked and so happy for all of you that the Spurs got Wemby and I cannot wait to follow the Spurs journey to the next championship.

2024-01-12,1705019746,"[Mat Moore] League sources have suggested that Young's camp would be open  if he is traded, which is a significant clause here  to pairing Young with Victor Wembanyama.","&gt;Shams Charania of [The Athletic reported this week](https://twitter.com/RunItBackFDTV/status/1744741524901093754) that the Spurs have an interest in trading for Murray after dealing him two years ago for five first-round picks. (Pretty smart, you get a point guard back and you make the team that owes you five picks worse.)  
&gt;  

&gt;Charania noted that Murray is under contract, so the Spurs have the leverage. However, there are indications Murray doesn't have significant interest in returning to the Spurs.  
&gt;  

&gt;A more interesting question is if the Spurs and Hawks would have interest in a deal for Young. **League sources have suggested that Young's camp would be open ** ***if he is traded,*** **which is a significant clause here  to pairing Young with Victor Wembanyama.** The two teams have already done a big trade for Murray, obviously, and Atlanta would surely be interested in getting back some of the draft picks it sent the Spurs for Murray.  
&gt;  

&gt;The most likely scenario, obviously, is that the Hawks keep Young and continue to build around him as their franchise cornerstone.  But the uncertainty of everything with the Hawks leaves the door open for a lot of outcomes.

2024-04-26,1714150932,Jokic on team building that can be applied to the Spurs,"Basically there is no shortcut to chemistry. Guys need 2-3 yrs of playing together to know how to play. Jamal Murray wasn't the only player Jokic had built chemistry with. He had good chemistry with Garry Harris and Jemeer Nelson too. But the team had to address the need and find the right guy for the roster.

For the Spurs, we already see the chemistry at the end of the season that wasn't there last year. That's a sign of progress and it will take 1-2 more years to see the ceiling of this team when everyone is on the same page. At that point, then, the team will start making hard decisions. Some of the fan favorite players will be gone for players who can fill the need of the team. 

From what we've heard so far. This is the direction that this Spurs team is taking. Young guys will get opportunities to grow and build chemistry and know how to play around Wemby.  What I expect to see is a rotating cast of veterans who will come and go during this process to mentor this young group and get a chance to play with Wemby before they retire.

2023-11-12,1699766458,Jeremy Sochan opens up on his struggles,"[Spurs' Jeremy Sochan opens up on his struggles to shift to point guard](https://www.expressnews.com/sports/spurs/article/spurs-jeremy-sochan-opens-struggles-shift-point-18485472.php)

  
Re-iterating he was committed to making the position change work, Sochan after practice Saturday acknowledged the move to point guard the shift has taken on him

&amp;#x200B;

 

There have been times during Jeremy Sochan's second NBA season in which he wishes he could go back in time.

He doesn't want to be a rookie again. He just wants to be a power forward.

That experiment as a Spurs point guard?

""There have been moments where it's like, 'Yo I don't want to,' "" Sochan said Saturday. ""It's like (expletive) this (expletive).""

Spurs coach Gregg Popovich has called the move of the 20-year-old Sochan from power forward to point guard the team's ""official experiment of 2023-24.""

Occasionally, that experiment has produced positive results. Occasionally, it has blown up in everyone's face.

This is to be expected.

""It is the first time I have ever played point guard in my life,"" Sochan said.

Re-iterating he was committed to trying to make the position change work, Sochan after practice Saturday acknowledged the toll it has taken on him.

""I am going to be honest,"" Sochan said, ""there have been moments where there isn't confidence.""

On the flip side, Sochan said, ""There have been moments of being confident.""

The 6-foot-8 Sochan experienced both sides of the spectrum in Friday's 117-110 loss to Minnesota. He committed a season-high six turnovers, including four in the first half.

He also contributed 14 points, seven rebounds, five assists and three steals, all while being asked to guard Timberwolves' All-Star Anthony Edwards.

As the Spurs attempted to come back from 18 points down, Sochan swished a key 3-pointer and found an open Tre Jones on a skip pass for another big bucket.

In nine games as the Spurs' starting point guard, Sochan is averaging 9.9 points, 5.4 rebounds and 4.7 assists. He has been one of the club's best defenders, and is tied with Victor Wembanyama for the team's lead in steals at 1.1 per game.

""I am making a transition like this in the NBA, which is rare,"" Sochan said. ""You don't see a lot of people going from power forward to point guard.""

Popovich and the Spurs' staff have been unwavering in their commitment to Sochan to start the season. He says he has also gotten support from Jones, last year's starter who is now coming off the bench.

""It means a lot,"" Sochan said. ""If you didn't have that side, it would be a lot harder. It feels good that everyone in this building believes in it, and they know that it is not always going to be perfect, but they are there for it.""",NBASpurs,75,https://www.reddit.com/r/NBASpurs/comments/17tdbvu/jeremy_sochan_opens_up_on_his_struggles/

They were ready to draft a player at No. 8. Theyd agreed on a prospect. And they were prepared to keep him.

But with seconds ticking away just before their pick was due, they received exactly the kind of offer they hoped would materialize Wednesday. The Minnesota Timberwolves wanted the Spurs selection, and they were willing to give up an unprotected 2031 first-rounder and the right to swap first-rounders in 2030 to get it.

Over the phone, the Timberwolves gave the Spurs a name  Rob Dillingham of Kentucky. Just beating the buzzer, the Spurs passed Dillinghams name along to the league.

---

As one member of the teams front office put it, San Antonio has a whole big chest of stuff it can use in the coming years to acquire high-profile, long-term Wembanyama running buddies. And as another Spurs official noted, a 2031 pick from a current contender like the Timberwolves is more attractive than a 2025 selection wouldve been, because it allows time to capitalize on chaos.",NBASpurs,85,https://www.reddit.com/r/NBASpurs/comments/1drl0gd/finger_all_the_members_of_the_spurs_brain_trust/

However he wasnt the [total blocks leader until last night.](https://www.nba.com/stats/players/traditional?sort=BLK&amp;dir=-1&amp;PerMode=Totals)

As of last night Wemby is ahead of Brook Lopez the former blocks leader with 133 blocks. 

Brook Lopez has 132 blocks so he isnt far behind at all. 

The next highest is Holmgren at 125, Kessler at 110, and Davis at 110. 

A rookie has not lead the league in blocks since Manute Bol in 1985. 

Keep in mind this is the age of the 3 point era so the defense isnt always at the rim like in Manute bols era and Wemby is not 77.

We got a generational talent in Wemby AFTER ONE SINGLE YEAR OF TANKING and you complain and act like we're in some tragic situation because the team is not competent yet? Do you have a clue of how team building works in the NBA?

We got MASSIVELY LUCKY to land Wemby last year, and there was no need to rush or overpay average player just to be more competitive this year. We got nothing to gain in that. Would you have preferred if the FO wasted all our cap space to get Van Vleet and Brooks?

It wasn't even a given that Wemby would be this good right away. We should be fucking thankful and excited every time he hits like 20 points, 8 rebounds and a couple blocks. When he enters his prime, he will be unstoppable.

&gt; Not caring what anybody thinks, thats a skill in this league, Green, the veteran Golden State forward, says. Jeremy, he dont give a (bleep). You can tell.   
&gt;  
&gt;From the instigator, this ranks among the highest of compliments. Hes played against Sochan only a few times, but hes impressed by the way the kid defends every position, and by the way he sees the floor, and especially by the way he actively tries to get under peoples skin.   
&gt;  
&gt;And it turns out, the feeling is mutual. When Sochan is asked if he can be as good at antagonizing as his Hall of Fame-bound role model, the second-year Spur positively lights up.   
&gt;  
&gt;Hell, yeah, Sochan says. Im still learning, Im young, but Im definitely going to be that. Im going to be one of those.  
&gt;  
&gt;The Spurs saw that potential two summers ago, when they made the Oklahoma-born, England-raised, Polish-blooded Baylor alum the No. 9 overall pick in the 2022 draft. Back then, a member of the San Antonio front office mentioned Greens skill set as a potential comparison, while conceding that Sochan had plenty of work to do to fulfill that potential.   
&gt;  
&gt;Now, Sochan says, I can become more than Draymond Green  a brash claim that might sound outrageous to everyone except for Green himself.   
&gt;  
&gt;He should think that, Green says. If Im him, looking at me, Im saying, Thats my floor. What can my ceiling be? If he dont think that way, thats an issue.

2024-06-27,1719452631,Don't be upset. We just traded out of a historically bad draft class.,"Everyone is overreacting.

1) Hasn't everyone been saying this draft class is garbage? I understand we all like Rob, but if the 2031 pick is a lottery and in a draft class that is better than this one (which is almost certain), then we'll almost benefit from the trade. Not to mention on top of that, the 2030 pick swap is **only top 1 protected**, all but ensuring that the swap is beneficial to us.

2) The Timberwolves will be pretty bad in 6-7 years. They're now missing **11 picks** from 2025-2031, Kat will be 35, and Gobert will 39. Once those players start getting older it'll go south really fast because they just won't have assets.

3) Ignoring the stuff above and your opinion on Rob, we turned 1 first rounder into 2 first rounders. If it's true that we end up sucking without Rob, then we can just turn those picks into a package to make ourselves better.

4) I would argue we don't even need Rob. Defensive liability, and we already drafted our PG of the future. ",NBASpurs,212,https://www.reddit.com/r/NBASpurs/comments/1dpfks1/dont_be_upset_we_just_traded_out_of_a/
