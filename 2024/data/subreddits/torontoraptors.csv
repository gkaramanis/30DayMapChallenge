2024-03-19,1710813922,Jaime Jaquez Jr had to bring Kyle Lowry Chick-Fil-A every single day&.,"Im watching the Sixers/Heat game and they mentioned how JJJ was deemed Lowrys rookie (rookies assigned to travel with vets is very common).  Typical rookie hazing.   JJJ supposedly is still resentful of this.

Whats crazy is that Kyle would make JJJ bring him Chick-Fil-A every single day.  Now I love CFA but every day?  When youre a professional athlete?  Damn Lowry&

[2K25 \(face scan not updated for him yet\)](https://preview.redd.it/qhcddzrqfjnd1.png?width=827&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4bc98f843cb2b09b76ed2496544c11eb07caccd7)

Video proof is on my Twitch channel, but I won't advertise that so if you want to hear him talk you can go there.

---

  
So, other than last night, I have played with Scott and his people every day since 2K25 released (Sept3-4) and it's been really cool and extremely normal. Our interactions are just like if I met anyone else on 2K.

What I didn't figure out until maybe 3 days ago, however, is that it isn't just him on the team and friends, but there's Raptors rookie Jonathan Mogbo, as well. There might be other rookies. I can't be for certain because I don't ask.

I was in the voice chat group and on September 3rd, I had already gotten on NBA 2K25, but they couldn't play yet. So they all wanted me to go to the Raptors roster to look at face scans, I said ok.

Mogbo, Shead, DJ, Gradey, there's others but quite a few of our guys don't have their roster face scan updated and they were having a laugh at how some of them look. (This time is when I figured out there's other basketball talent in this voice chat other than Scott)

After that, I helped them all make their first builds as I screen shared my game for them in the PlayStation voice chat, and we went through each build.

---

I play pretty good as a PG and that's the reason I got brought in, so that's been fun because I actually wanted a proam team for this year, and now I have one. And it has our guy Scottie on the team, which is hilarious.

  
I don't want to give a whole minute-by-minute ""what is Scottie like"" ordeal, but I guess for fans of this team, and if you don't follow his Twitch streams when he does get on, I'm going to describe how he's been playing in 2K25.

He's pretty good considering the game is so new and different from last year, selfish at times in ISO situations but makes good decisions most of the time with the ball. He's always calm and locked in when we play 5's. He seems to play best when we face stronger teams, his words. He keeps others accountable without getting angry or heated. He's always talking and communicating on defense, and regardless of what build he plays on, he dictates a lot of the offense. (and it works, mostly)

Outside of games, just being in the voice chats has been fun and surprisingly easy going. Two nights ago I took a break and didn't get on until late in the day and I had a message from him wondering where I was because he wanted me to play 2K. He's just a normal guy. We've had very little to no in real life talk. Again, I don't ask.

I can vouch for any of the 7, 8 people I've played with as being super chill, great people. Only me and 1 other person are new to the group.

I think that's enough, but let me know if you're wondering about anything else that I can talk about. Can't wait for the season to start!",torontoraptors,33,https://www.reddit.com/r/torontoraptors/comments/1fbsriw/hey_people_its_me_againthe_guy_who_played_2k24/

2023-12-09,1702147173,This sub is more of a dumpster fire than the team itself.,"Just a bunch of miserable doomers.

The game last night:

Loved seeing Scottie gain this type of experience in a loss. People, not just basketball players, learn better with failure than with success. He'll get there.

Flynn played with energy. If he keeps this up he might actually deserve a roster spot and I like that he's stuck with it and got to this point.

Boucher, Siakam, OG. All played their role to some degree. OG had his worst shooting night of the season, and maybe since 2022 as well. Boucher has always been a sparkplug. Siakam upping his trade value.

Poetl: probably one of his worst games. He might have trade value, but he might be a fine presence to keep in the locker room. No issues.

GTJ: Ive been saying this all season. He's done. He needs a new home. Either he wants to be the #1 or #2 option, or there's something else going on, but this guy has lost his confidence. Something gotta give.

Stop crying about the season or the FO. We won a chip FIVE years ago. That's insane. Luka &amp; the Mavs might NEVER win a chip together. The Thunder roster might NEVER win a chip. It is so unbelievably hard to do, and we did it. This team can dick around for a while, Scottie looks like the real deal.",torontoraptors,260,https://www.reddit.com/r/torontoraptors/comments/18ejyt8/this_sub_is_more_of_a_dumpster_fire_than_the_team/

Not giving up on him *forever*, since he just turned 20 and at that age a lot can change in a year, but it seems clear to me that he's not going to turn a corner any time soon and this is not just a shooting slump. Right now he's a negative player in virtually every respect.

It's unfortunate that the Raptors drafted a player specifically for his shooting only for him to play a quarter of his rookie season and not just be a *bad* shooter, but one of the *worst* shooters in the NBA *and* the G-League. That's very alarming and disappointing. ",torontoraptors,230,https://www.reddit.com/r/torontoraptors/comments/18ipqwy/gradey_dick_210_from_the_field_16_from_three_and/

There's a learning process for these players. They also have minimal veteran leadership because all of our veterans outside of Poeltl come off the bench, or don't play. 

Not to mention this team is actively trying to lose. We obviously don't have a lot of talent on this roster, and management has chosen to address it through the draft. 

When the Raps lose our pick gets better, when the Raps win it's cause the young players are developing.

2024-06-01,1717265547,Scottie Barnes China Trip,"Greetings fellow dinos!

We are China-Raptors Podcast, a mandarin-speaking podcast launched in 2021/2022 on Chinese platform Ximalaya (lÉÅ÷5ð), taking about everything about the Raps.

Raptors fans in China is (unsurprisingly) a niche compared to huge amounts of (bandwagon) GSW, Lakers, Rockets fans, but we have some of the most die-hard OG followers.

As you may have seen, Scottie is on a trip to HK and mainland China now, and we had the opportunity to collaborate with his crew from Nike to organize some of our die hard fans and send our love to our boy. 



Chinese Fans Greetings Video for Scottie:

2023-12-19,1702946408,Will Lou and the Raptors show are dead wrong about Darko,"I will preface this by saying I love the show, and listen a ton. However some comments made today were way off base and were borderline unprofessional towards Darko. 

To start, Will has been very critical of Darko for the past few weeks, and whether warranted or not was mostly were acceptable as they were based on his performance.

Today the guys were talking about the story that came out where Darko said his main advice to Malachi was to ""smile more"". They openly mocked this report and then started talking about how Darkos overly positive energy is too much, and can come off as weird at times. They mentioned how these athletes are millionaires and not children, and acted as though this positive energy is a bad look for Darko. Will Lou even made an off base comment about how Darkos weird energy is likely a cultural thing with Darko being european, despite the fact that he has been in the USA for close to half of his life. Not only this, coaches from Europe have a reputation of being extremely hard nosed and rough with players, which is the exact opposite of Darko.

What they absolutely failed to acknowledge is that whatever Darko has done has made Malachi a serviceable NBA player, which is something I never thought would happen. Blake even mocks the fact that Malachi went from ""Euroleague player"" to Backup NBA player"", and downplayed this as if it was a joke and not a big deal. 

They also failed to acknowledge Scottie becoming the star player we knew he could become, which is in large part due to how Darko has utilized him in comparison to Nick.

Now to the biggest issue I have with their banter today. The 3 of them acted as though Darko was a weird guy, and insinuated that players wouldn't respond well to that kind of energy. This is not even close to the case, as we have heard a TON of players openly support Darko, with many of them saying nothing but glowing reviews. He's also only **25 games** into his coaching career, and to judge him now is ridiculous considering we just spent the past 3 years crying about how awful this roster construction is.

TL;DR: The 3 Raptors Show hosts openly mocked Darko over his extreme positivity, and completely downplayed any positive impact he has had on this team.

Edit: I'm not saying Darko has even done a good job here, especially considering he's still rolling with his starting lineup despite the fact that we just went down by double digits to the Charlotte G League team to start the game. I'm trying to say his personality shouldn't be mocked just because his first 25 games haven't gone super well.",torontoraptors,237,https://www.reddit.com/r/torontoraptors/comments/18lojbr/will_lou_and_the_raptors_show_are_dead_wrong/

2024-09-15,1726421217,An excerpt from DeMars memoir that mentions a meaningful moment in my life,"This isnt anything important or revolutionary, I just wanted to share this.

The reason why I wanted to point out this part in DeMars book is because that moment he described was the moment that made me a DeMar DeRozan fan and Raptors fan by extension.

I remember watching this game as a 15-year old in 2017 - I was alone at home and someone had left the living room TV on and the Raptors-Knicks games was playing. That year, I was planning on getting into watching the NBA, since my brother had bought NBA 2K17. Mind you, I had no idea who was on the roster at the time; I knew some household names like Michael Jordan, Kobe Bryant and LeBron James and some former Raptors such as Chris Bosh and Rudy Gay, but no clue who anyone playing was. So when DeMar hit that fadeaway game-winner on Derrick Rose and skipped down the court with a smug look on his face, I vividly remember saying to myself This guys good. Im gonna follow this guy.

This one moment had a big impact on my life thereafter. From that moment on, I decided DeMar was gonna be my GOAT.  What Michael Jordan was to Kobe Bryant, and what Kobe was to DeMar, DeMar was that for me. Its because of Deebo that I do small things, like wear silicone wristbands and primarily hooping in Kobes to bigger things like how I view mental health, making me comfortable with my own struggles (I had low self-confidence and poor self-esteem in high school) and why I even started playing basketball.

I know this is probably insignificant to 99.999999% of Raptors fans, I just thought it would be cool to share that, in what was a life-altering moment for me is mentioned in my favourite players memoir.",torontoraptors,25,https://www.reddit.com/r/torontoraptors/comments/1fhhzpd/an_excerpt_from_demars_memoir_that_mentions_a/

During the show, in addition to talking about mental health, he answered questions attendees had put into a ballot, told stories of him growing up, his relationship with Kobe Bryant and Kyle Lowry.
Some of the things he revealed are that when he was a teenager, after his dad fell asleep, he would steal his dads car and waited for the train to pass by (they lived near a train station) so his dad couldnt hear the car start; his dad legitimately thought the neighbours were siphoning his gas and he would peek out the window every day to catch them. He also revealed that Kyle will text him their highlights of their time together on the Raptors to reminisce. He even FaceTimed Kyle at the end of the show.

I wouldve loved for there to be a meet and greet after the show so I can finally meet my GOAT, dap him, have a quick conversation with him and maybe even ask him to sign my jersey, but just being able to see him in-person and be in the same room as him was enough for me.

2024-03-29,1711751836,Gradey is going to be a seriously good player ,"Obviously he has a ton to work on still but his shooting mechanics are so pure hes gonna be a consistently elite 3 point shooter very soon. And his overall game shows some seriously impressive flashes, specifically his body control and touch around the rim at times and his pull up jumper looking extremely smooth. Like i really think hes actually gonna be a core piece we build around for the future. Also consistently makes the right reads and right play so his basketball iq is there as well. Maybe its too early to be saying this but I think hes gonna be an elite level role player.

2024-02-01,1706759235,Raptors905 Jersey Scandal,"I'm sure we've all seen the sick Lunar New Years jerseys online with the Raptor-Dragon, totally sick right? It was advertised as ""Get your jersey at the game tonight"", in an attempt to sell tickets to a mid week game.

Like many others, I bought tickets to see the 905 play tonight in order to cop one of these jerseys....

I came an hour before the game to snag one, many others did as well and there was literally NO jerseys. They were selling the shirts, hats and sweaters but not the advertised jerseys.

Part of the crowd thought they sold out, part of the crowd thought that maybe they came too early and they didn't unbox them yet, it was all really confusing... no one from the Raptors905 was really saying anything.

As I entered the arena, NO ONE in the arena was wearing the jersey - which I thought was a little odd if they indeed sold out, you think that at least a couple people would be wearing them? I slowly stepped away from that being a theory.

During the pre-game, the in game announcers were telling people that they were available so it got really confusing... some people were leaving to get to the concourse that maybe they just dropped/got unboxed.

We didn't know it at the time but... This. Was. A. Scam.

During the half /end of the game, there were LONG lines near customer service for people to give their information for some sort of presale code for when they get more in stock, the explanation  I got was that they sold out online and that they didn't have enough at the stadium.

I call BS on that one, you couldn't buy these jerseys online - it was advertised as being sold at the concourse with posts linking to ticket sales, you have to buy a ticket to get into the concourse to grab a physical jersey, (That were not there to begin with).

No social media post, no in game announcement, no sign saying ""Sorry, we sold out""...  they're just allowed to drop the ball and walk away.

Shame on Raptors905/MLSE, what a low thing to do for your fanbase.

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR - Fans were tricked into buying Raptors905 tickets so they could buy special edition Lunar New Year jerseys that weren't even there.  


\*\*\* EDIT - I've been hearing from a few people that the jersey may have been available online briefly and then sold out a few days ago but the 905 continued with the marketing push to get people in seats by advertising that you could buy these at the stadium when they were long gone - if true, still really crummy.

""Betting limits on NBA player props vary by sportsbook and customer, but are typically around $1,000 to $2,000. People were trying to do whatever they could to bet Jontay Porter props \[against the Clippers\], the source said. And then, just a few days ago, the same thing.

Ochai is an effort piece you absolutely want on your team, he defends obviously, he will rip down boards, grab 50/50 balls, his offensive game is absolutely going to develop despite its shortcomings and he already had tons of flashes of that. 

Have patience with him and it'll be worth it, because  most Jazz fans didn't. He would barely get shots and if he missed the one or two he got in a game he'd get destroyed all over social media for it. His effort in games was always going overlooked especially at the end. I'm a huge believer in him, he's absolutely going to flame Utah in the upcoming years at least a few times when we match up. 

I know you guys had OG Anunoby and I don't think Ochai is that good obviously but he has the potential to fill that hole that was left trading OG. Just a really good fit for Toronto, I'm going to be cheering for you guys for a long time. 

I want to say more but like honestly I'm just baffled, absolutely baffled, you guys won that trade imo, take care of my man Ochai, this one really hurts a lot lol.",torontoraptors,43,https://www.reddit.com/r/torontoraptors/comments/1alzdgg/jazzhuge_ochai_fan_here_you_guys_will_love_him/

2023-11-08,1699480406,The way this organization and fan base has treated Siakam lately has been borderline disgraceful - and we wonder why he's been playing poorly.,"Let's recap what he's meant to this franchise, shall we? Drafted as an unknown player who nobody wanted, he made the rotation from the start with energy, then quickly developed and improved. He worked his way up to 2nd option on the NBA champions, he's led this team in scoring for 4 straight seasons, made all NBA, all star, and has a case for top 5 Raptor in franchise history.

In the last few months, what has he gotten in return? 

\-Front office, Masai Ujiri in particular, indicating he was part of a ""selfishness"" core, leaving other unflattering comments, refusing to talk extension. 

\-Coaching staff that while praising him, has made a clear move to put Scottie in as ""the man""

\-Fans who have largely shitted on him, forgotten or moved on, and openly discussing trading him for some 3&amp;D role players. Basically wanting him to get out of the way so Scottie can be king.

And despite all that, we expect him to figure it out, slide in as a #2 option again, and be really productive. With his ego, pride, role, all confused and bruised. You know how many times in league history guys who were THE MAN on the team willingly slid off to a younger up and comer, while still in their own prime, without being traded? It's a very short list, and we expect Pascal to accept it overnight. Even Monta Ellis thought he didn't deserve to hand the reigns to Stephen Curry, lol.

I really hope Pascal gets shown some more love, and finds his way, and becomes our apex second banana he can be. I haven't forgotten what he's done or meant for this franchise. ",torontoraptors,151,https://www.reddit.com/r/torontoraptors/comments/17qwry0/the_way_this_organization_and_fan_base_has/

It was very clear right from the beginning the refs were not going to allow Canada in the game at all. There were soooo many questionable calls but I will name a few:

France drove the lane, Canada took a charge offensive foul and they counted the basket?

At end of game Murray had a pass into the paint and France guy literally chopped his arm so hard right infront of the refs and refs called it a turnover. 

I know appeals do nothing and its way better for them to have France go on for tickets etc.. but this is egregious.

With all that in mind, I think he did a really great job of appreciating his fans and making the appearance special. I came decked out in FSU gear and Scottie told me he liked my jacket. He lit up when I mentioned Im from West Palm. He let me take a photo doing the tomahawk chop. Afterwards, I was hoping to sneak in him signing my Raptors jersey so I came with sharpie in hand, but clearly he wasnt allowed to for the event (plus I recognize theres conflict for players because the NBA sells signed jerseys). I thanked him and before walking away he called to someone and told them to give me a ball. He signed the ball and put GO NOLES! For like one quick minute, Scottie really made it special for me. He made my whole weekend. I love this guy yall hes such a good dude.

2024-01-08,1704743255,Dennis Schröder is a real one,"Just want to give this man his flowers. Not just his ability but his mentality and unselfishness.

I remember in one of his first interviews, he refers to himself as the starter but later says he will play wherever he is asked (as lineup had not been determined)....but we lost FVV, Scottie not ready yet, he has relationship with Darko, lots of of experience, other option is Malachi...I think it's common logic he was penciled as our starter for opening night.

Team performs poorly and Darko (another shoutout) benches him, before the trade, to try and shake it up. Now that the dust is settling after the trade, he must know that as it stands, there is NO WAY he re enters the SL.

And the man doesn't let it affect his game, he just keeps on about his business and handles his shit.

Starter numbers: 14.7 / 2.7 / 6.8 with a .546 TS%

Reserve numbers: 13.8 / 3.5 / 6.5 with a .635 TS%

His usage is also down from 20.3 to 16.5 but I think a lot of players in this league, if haven gone through this, would start chucking off the bench. 

Dennis is doing what's best for the team, time and again and he is a mf real one. He is holding everyone accountable for team comradery (aka vibes). A true leader of men and I hope he's part of this franchise (in some capacity) after his playing career is over.",torontoraptors,73,https://www.reddit.com/r/torontoraptors/comments/191u1lv/dennis_schröder_is_a_real_one/
