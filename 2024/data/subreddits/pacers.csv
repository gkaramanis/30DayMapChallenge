2024-01-17,1705529361,Pascal Siakam is a perfect fit for the Pacers (from a Raptors fan),"Seeing a lot of Pacers fans posting in the Raps subs asking for opinions on Siakam.

imo hes still an All-NBA talent. The last 2-3 years hes been held back by not only being on a bad team, but being in a really bad fit. Hes the type of guy that you surround with shooters, and until the OG trade we didnt have a single shooter in the starting lineup.

Hes the most elite that a second option can be, and pairing him with a playmaking first option like Haliburton is going to be a phenomenal pairing. Also having a stretch 5 in Turner and the shooters yall have around him, I think youll be a genuine contender.

Personality wise hes one of the most positive guys Ive watched, hes always having fun and his come up story is pretty cool. For those who dont know, he only started playing ball at like age 17, got drafted late and worked his way up to all-NBA. He has mad hustle, crazy physicality and size and I think as a second option and in a winning environment youre gonna see his defence level back up.

His whole career hes been a late bloomer, I think hes gonna play his best basketball on the Pacers. Hes extremely underrated as a playmaker as well, with the lack of spacing idk how hes averaged 5-6 assists per game, with the time hes gonna have in the paint hes gonna always be a scoring threat and if he gets doubled he almost always makes the right pass out.

2024-05-15,1715802007,Let's be real,"Home court advantage has been huge in this series, we can all see it clearly. 

The probable outcome of this series is the Knicks win in 7. I don't think the Pacers will give up a game at home, and will finish the playoffs undefeated in Gainbridge. That's massive. 

Game 7 will be a slugfest. I'm not saying the Pacers don't have a chance, if they play like they did in game 1 and maybe even bring some of the energy from games 3, 4, and 6, they'll have a shot. But it seems more likely than not that it's not in the cards to win in MSG.

THAT BEING SAID

This series will do so much more for our team development going into next year and especially our next playoff run than anything that's happened up to this point (even, and especially, the Bucks series). The young players have now seen what it takes to compete in the playoffs, and will have learned many lessons about what to do and not to do in high pressure situations. 

So, we get through the end of this series, wipe the board clean, get some rest, get everybody right, and come back next year with a clean slate of 82 (plus) games ready to take it even further. 

Losing to the Knicks sucks, but it even took Reggie a few tries to get over that hump. The two franchises will be tied at 4-4 against each other in the playoffs, and it seems likely we'll meet again next year. 

Losing in MSG is frustrating, especially when it seems rather clear the changes that need to be made. It's hard to account for a guy like Brunson doing his thing though. But the future is brighter than it's ever been.

And just think, had things gone slightly differently this year, we could've been in the play in and lost and not even gotten this experience. 

We're gonna be alright. ",pacers,26,https://www.reddit.com/r/pacers/comments/1cstqsr/lets_be_real/

2024-09-27,1727455018,"Myles Turners contract should be discussed. Do we keep him? If so, what does his contract look like?","Myles Turner is currently our third best player. He averaged 17 and 6 for the season on 52% from the field, which is a solid stat-line for a third option. I remember seeing some stat about hos the Tyrese Haliburton and Myles Turner pick and pop was one of the top scoring plays in the league. 

Although he averaged similar numbers in the playoffs, he was absolutely a level above what he was in the regular season. After the ASB, it seemed like his shot-blocking ability came back to him, and he was putting everyone on a poster. All of this makes him super valuable to this team.

However, this also means that Myles Turner is going to get looked at by *other* teams. That allusive stretch five title is a very valuable asset to any team. I think every team in the league besides the ones that already have those shot-blocking three point shooting centers would absolutely love to have him. 

I think it is absolutely crucial to keep him. Chad Buchanan has made it very clear that he wants Turner to stay. With that being said, we know we cant pay everyone. Pascal did take a substantial pay cut, opting to not take the max contract, but we did have to pay Obi Toppin, Andrew Nembhard, and TJ McConnell.

From Masai never building a proper team around his talent/skillset (not saying he's a number one option to be built around, just that when you have an All-NBA and All-Star calibre player like him, you logically would aim to build a team that compliments him), and then for Masai to lay all the blame on him for the state of the team during Media Day this year by calling him ""selfish"" (when he's never been selfish, and on the contrary the problem has always been him deferring too much in important moments), to the weird interpersonal drama within the team (e.g. VanVleet wanting to have a role as big as his when he's not as good as him, OG and Scottie also wanting bigger roles when they also weren't as good as him at that point in time), but especially to the fans who kept on denigrating him for not being a number one option a la Lebron/Giannis/etc. (when he was never expected to even be as good as he's become, being an older, late 1st round pick) and pitting him against Scottie Barnes constantly and making it about their personal characters (when from all the evidence, like Barnes saying Siakam's his favorite player every year since he was drafted, they get along great/wanted to play with each other).

And as someone who's watched him since he was drafted, I know he has his flaws, and won't be able to carry a team to a Championship, and will probably make some frustrating decisions in big moments that will probably fade away some of the honeymoon phase shine that he has right now (especially if he gets that max bag lol) but seriously, I'm just grateful and relieved that you guys see how good he is and appreciate him for WHO he is, because the Toronto FO/media/fans have always expected/asked for too much from him when he's already improved every year/adapted to every single iteration of the team he's been given. And I know it was time to move on/build around Scottie Barnes, but there was no need for fans to put Siakam down for that to happen, so I'm also extra glad that there's no Haliburton vs. Siakam sentiments happening and them not ""fitting the same timeline"" because of their ages (which is what everyone in Toronto was always saying about Siakam and Barnes, when the truth is if you're a competent FO and have talents like that, you find a way to build around them).

Anyways rant over lol. Ever since the Raps have become unwatchable I've started watching more Pacers games, and I've really enjoyed finally seeing some good basketball lol. I hope you guys make the playoffs, and I'll be bandwagonning/rooting for you guys to make it all the way.

2024-01-31,1706717213,Taking a look at the Pacers' cap situation after trading for Pascal Siakam,"Hello friends, with the deadline coming up I wanted to take the opportunity to go ahead and talk about a big trade that's already happened and go over what the salary consequences might be. Much conversation can be had about Siakam's fit with the team on the court, the price that Indiana paid to get him, and where they now stand in the East after pushing some (but not all) of their chips into the center of the table. But I think that it would be a fun exercise to take a look into their cap situation going forward to see just how flexible or tight their finances might be as a result of this commitment. 

For this 2023-2024 season, they only marginally increased their total salaries and stayed well below the luxury tax, but what about the next two seasons? Ownership in Indiana has been hesitant to pay any luxury tax in the past, so does this trade leave them any breathing room to retain and add players over the next couple years?

Much of the talk around a Siakam trade was about his desire to hit free agency this offseason and the Pacers are without a doubt going to need to open up the checkbook to keep him in Indiana beyond this year. While we can't be sure if Pascal will command the full five-year max, it is worth examining what their cap sheet would look like if they do end up paying the full price this summer. Let's take a look:

|Player|2024-2025|
:--|--:|
|Pascal Siakam|$42,300,000|
|Myles Turner|$19,928,500|
|Buddy Hield|UFA|
|TJ McConnell|$9,300,000|
|Bennedict Mathurin|$7,245,720|
|Obi Toppin|UFA|
|Jarace Walker|$6,362,520|
|Tyrese Haliburton|$35,250,000|
|Aaron Nesmith|$11,000,000|
|Jalen Smith|*$5,417,386*|
|Isaiah Jackson|$4,435,381|
|Ben Sheppard|$2,663,880|
|Andrew Nembhard|$2,019,699|
|||
|total|$145,923,086|
|expected salary cap|$141,000,000|
|expected luxury cap|$171,315,000|

*^(italics indicate player option)*

So as things currently stand, if the Pacers max Siakam this summer they would still be a projected $24.8 million below the expected luxury line. Buddy Hield and Obi Toppin will be unrestricted free agents, so Indiana will need to use that room to re-sign those players if they decide that they want to run it back with the same team next season. Also, Jalen Smith has a player option for $5.4 million that he will likely decline in order to sign a longer-term deal, either in Indiana or somewhere else, and that will drop their salary total to $30.2 million below the luxury tax line. The Pacers' front office can use the rest of this season to determine what kind of contracts they will be willing to extend to Hield, Toppin, and Smith this summer.

On top of Smith's decision on his option, there are two more major things that could affect that projected room below the luxury tax: the cap increase and Haliburton's all-NBA possibility. The NBA recently announced a new luxury tax projection of $171,315,000. The maximum increase of 10% would bring it all the way to $181,000,000, but it wouldn't be wise to count on a maximum increase before the new TV rights deal gets inked in 2025. However, it's not unreasonable to think that the luxury tax line could end up being slightly higher than the current projection. The other variable of Haliburton's all-NBA possibility is an interesting one. If he makes any of the all-NBA teams, then his salary will be significantly higher for his next contract. His 2024-2025 salary would rise to $42.6 million, which is not so high that their finances would be in ruins, but it would use up much of the small bit of cap flexibility that have remaining. The $30.2 million in projected room I mentioned earlier would fall to $23.1 million.

Haliburton has unquestionably performed at an all-NBA level this season, but his recent injuries complicate the probability of raising his payday due to the new 65 game minimum threshold for awards. As of January 31, he can only miss 3 more games this season and still qualify, so it's not impossible but not necessarily likely. Let's just say for now that he misses the threshold, and his salary doesn't get raised. What might the Pacers' offseason moves look like?

I would assume there is a desire to bring back Buddy Hield as a free agent. Indiana will have his bird rights so they can effectively pay him whatever would be needed to ensure that he stays around, but the front office likely wants to make sure that his next contract is tradable if young players like Nembhard, Mathurin, and Nesmith continue to develop and make Hield more expendable. Obi Toppin has performed well for the Pacers so there could be mutual interest in a return next season, however, Siakam's presence does complicate Toppin's role since they play the same position. Jalen Smith has also performed well this year and could be interested in remaining in Indiana to back up Turner, but he will likely be looking for a pay increase. If Indiana does decide to let Smith walk, then replacing him with a cheap bench center shouldn't be particularly difficult.

There is also the possibility of adding new talent in free agency with the non-taxpayer MLE, which is projected to be $12.86 million for 2024-2025 and can only be used by a team who remains under the luxury tax line. If Indiana is able to retain Hield at the right number, fill out the bottom of the roster with veteran minimums, and remain at least $13 million below the luxury line afterward, then they will have the option of using the MLE to add a helpful player in free agency. Moving off of McConnell's salary through trade or a ""waive and stretch"" would also open up more room to operate with. If Hield ends up leaving in free agency to join another team, then I would think that the MLE will almost certainly be utilized by the front office this summer to replace him.

So, we have determined that Indiana is in a good position to bring back most of their team for 2024-2025 and avoid the luxury tax. What about 2025-2026? Turner will become an unrestricted free agent and will require a sizeable financial commitment to keep around. But with Walker, Nembhard, and Mathurin still on their rookie deals and Nesmith starting his affordable extension, the Pacers should still have a healthy cap situation to allow them to bring back Turner without too much stress. Let's just plug in some hypothetical salaries for Hield, Turner, and Jackson and see what their 2025-2026 cap sheet *could* look like:

|Player|2025-2026|
:--|--:|
|Pascal Siakam|$45,684,000|
|Tyrese Haliburton|$38,340,000|

|total|$187,897,032|
|expected luxury cap|$188,400,000|


*^(italics indicate hypothetical salary)*

In reality they will likely have a different version of what I've shown you, but regardless of the details I believe that Indiana should feel confident that they can pay max contracts to Haliburton and Siakam and still have a healthy cap situation to allow them to build around those two in the coming years. Pacer fans can feel good about this trade and the timing of it. The only real downside of this trade from a cap perspective is that they won't be able to open up salary cap space to play with in free agency any time soon. Considering that star players rarely hit free agency anymore and Indiana doesn't have the best history of attracting big names, trading for a star player now seems like it's the best course of action.

The Pacers' front office deserves credit for putting itself in position to make this big move by making a series of successful smaller moves over the past year. They signed Bruce Brown with cap space, overpaying him but securing a team option on the second year which made him a valuable trade chip. They had an extra first round pick to put into the Siakam deal due to a previous trade with Denver where they sent out the 29th pick, which they had acquired from trading Malcolm Brogdon to Boston. They have Aaron Nesmith locked up at $11 million per year for the next three seasons, which looks like it has the potential to be a bargain. They have Myles Turner making under $20 million next season due to signing him to a declining contract the previous year. They have also drafted some quality young players that will fill out the bench with cheap salaries. Overall, their cap space and draft picks have been well managed, allowing them to pay up for a player like Siakam, even if his salary is a little pricey this summer.

So, what do you guys think? Did Indiana make the right move trading for Siakam? How should they build around him and Haliburton in the coming years? Any interesting takeaways from the cap sheets? Let me know in the comments and thanks for reading!

**TLDR: If the Pacers give Siakam the full max, they should still have some room under the luxury tax line to re-sign their free agents and/or make a new addition with the non-taxpayer MLE. Exactly how much room they have to work with depends on how much the cap jumps and whether or not Haliburton makes all-NBA, but they should be in a pretty good spot financially for the next couple of seasons if they want to keep their team together even without paying luxury tax.**",pacers,43,https://www.reddit.com/r/pacers/comments/1aflask/taking_a_look_at_the_pacers_cap_situation_after/

2024-04-10,1712783347,Since the All-Star Break: Pacers have the 5th best Net Rating,"Boston +15

Denver +10

Minnesota + 6.4

Dallas + 6.1

Pacers +5.8

&amp;#x200B;

I get the national media missing this story, but I am honestly surprised how many Pacers' fans don't realize how good this team has been playing.  

Since the All-Star brea the Pacers had the 15th best Defense and the 2nd best Offense.  This is a recipe for a very good team.

When you add in that Haliburton has slowly been getting healthy this whole time, we have reason to be VERY OPTIMISTIC about this team.  

Let's look at the East. Since the All-Star Break.  The Pacers have 

1) The third most wins behind Magic and Celtics

2)  2nd Best offense (4 pts better than the 3rd place team!)

3)  The 2nd best Net Rating in the East

4. The Pacers have winning records this season against every East team in the top 8 except the Celtics (2-3) and the Magic (1-2)

The Pacers are young and have had some immature losses to bad teams. This is frustrating BUT the Pacers have showed up all season long against the good teams which is much more important in the playoffs. 

I understand not wanting to get our hopes up, but this is a second round team. And if we play anyone but the Celtics AND Hali is 95% we have a real chance to go to the ECF. 

More importantly to me: next year the Pacers are going to be really really good. A healthy Hali, a healthy third year Mathurin and a full training camp to get Pascal incorporated. The future is bright.

2024-05-24,1716559933,Rick pulled the starters and it was the correct thing to do,"This is our 3rd road game in a row. We just saw Thibs grind his guys to dust. We just came back to win a series down 2-0 (I know, I know, the Celtics aren't the Knicks). 

It's a 7 point game in the 3rd when the bench comes in for its normal time slot. We then have that awful brick -&gt; off rebound -&gt; brick -&gt; off rebound -&gt; brick -&gt; off rebound -&gt; brick sequence that leads to a Boston dunk. We are down 11 now with 3:44 to go in the 3rd. That is when Tyrese comes out, replaced by Pascal. Pascal sat with 5:20 to go in the 3rd and came back in with 3:44 to go in the 3rd. 

At this point, the line up is TJ, Shep, Pascal, Obi, Turner. They play out the quarter and it's a 13 point game.

Start of the 4th, the lineup is TJ, Shep, Doug, Pascal, Jackson. The only gripe I have is Doug, he should not have been in there. But other than that, what ""starter"" do you want? Turner who played the whole 3rd and wasn't having a good night? Nesmith who was 3-7 shooting with 4 fouls?

Pascal hits a shot to cut it to 11, then the Celtics stretch it to 17 with 9:25 to go in the 4th. That is when Rick pulls Pascal for Obi and TJ for Nembhard.

Shep and Nembhard get it down to 13 but the Celtics then go on a 5-0 run. There are 8 minutes left to go and we are down 18.

If we got it down to single digits or 10, I think Rick puts Pascal back in, but it never gets closer than 14.

Pascal was gassed, Tyrese was out, and Turner wasn't having a good night. It was up to the bench to get it close, but they couldn't do it. Rest up and come back swinging game 3.",pacers,82,https://www.reddit.com/r/pacers/comments/1czlpdi/rick_pulled_the_starters_and_it_was_the_correct/

Our offense was so smooth it made other teams look like they weren't trying hard on defense because of all the shots we were making.

We spent a season - not a stretch of 5, 10 games, a whole fucking season with such an offense and people who didn't watch us just think we were having random scoring nights because we played the Hawks. Well 28 other teams played the Hawks and they weren't putting up what we were putting up.

Latest example is the series against the Celtics, look at how bad Mavs offense is looking after 3 games against the Celtics and look at how much we were putting up against them - even D. White came out to give props to our offense.

2024-05-22,1716347990,The refs were awful. But we choked.,"No matter how young a team is, all of our players and our championship coach should know what to do in this situation. You are up by three. You have the ball. You have a timeout in case the inbound doesnt go well. 

Instead, Rick opts not to use his timeout, Nembhard gets nervous, and passes it to our worst free throw shooter. Pascal then proceeds to lose the ball. That is a choke job. Tyrese also passes open a wide open game winner. That just sealed the deal for a loss to me.

listen, there was no excuse you can use to justify losing that. i dont care how bad the refs were, this was our game to steal, and we had it won. we havent won a game 1 all playoffs long, and this wouldve given this team a whole lot of steam and a lot of respect wouldve been earned. yet rick and crew put out one of the biggest disasterclasses ive ever seen from a team in the clutch.

As of right now, the Pacers even when they were without Haliburton seemed like a bigger headache than the Mavs have been. 

Idk how they are still doing this, but people severely underrate how good the Pacers offense is. Outside of Luka, everyone on the Mavs seemed either scared or shook in some way. Even when Haliburton went down, NO ONE on the Pacers looked that way. 

Pacers defense was also better. Mavs POA defense is atrocious and the C's are getting by their man every time down the floor. 

Mavs definitely have time to turn things around, it's a long series and we know that Luka + Kyrie are a fucking force, but as of right now, I feel like the Pacers were the better team and harder opponenet.""

Draymond continues: 

Tyrese is great, hes one of the better point guards in this league for sure. Pascal Siakam: champion, All-NBA, All-Star.

2024-05-04,1714789409,I was wrong about Toppin. ,"Well, when Pacers acquired Obi Toppin in the offseason, I was pretty skeptical to say the least. In a post here, I questioned why they would want to add another player that doesn't rebound and play defense; while only providing cherry picking runouts.

Now, I can say I was wrong in more ways than one. First, he's been dependable as any; 82 games played. Second, l've found myself cheering because of a great Toppin block, strong contest or even a contested rebound more times than I can remember. Third, the guy shot 40% from 3.

Then, to Top it off, he's our leading scorer in a series clinching game 6. He played great and has been a huge part of the team's success this season.

2. Buddy hasnt looked great at all times to start the year, but hes still one of the best long range shooters in the league, and his defense has looked so much better recently. He plays an important role on our team. 

3. We dont know this teams ceiling. We keep beating good teams, and were showing extended consistency against others. What are we chasing, exactly, when we dont even know this teams limit?

4. I am convinced free agents will want to play here in the future. We are literally setting records for best offensive statistics. We may not get the absolute best free agent available, but Im convinced we can garner significant FA interest nonetheless. Why trade for Siakam, for example, when its reported he wants to come here in the off season? And even if that calculated risk doesnt pay off, we know Jarace will be there soon.

2024-05-22,1716390508,"The ""Pacer Way""...","I'm an O.G. Pacer fan. 40 years in. I've been a fan so long, I've had the opportunity to raise a son who is a die-hard Pacer fan. I can still remember the time we had at Game 4 ECF 2013 when the Pacers tied up the series with the Heat. Just this year, we attended the all-time classic IST game against Boston (you had to be there). Suns vs. Pacers, D. Book dropping 62, but Obi hitting the game winner. Hali's game winner against the Bucks in Round 1. There have been countless memories over the years, too many to even recall them all. One stands out more than most though. It was the game that I had to teach my son the ""Pacer Way"".


What is the ""Pacer Way"" you might ask. It's a coping mechanism you develop over the years to deal with the fact your team doesn't seem to get a fair shake. Some weaker minded souls are unable to develop the ""scab"" to the unfairness. It eats at them so much they give up and move on from the NBA or do the unspeakable and move on to fandom of bigger city teams, with bigger city whistles.

Not us die-hards though. You dig deep and learn to blame everything on your team. Bad call at end of game, ""shouldn't have been that close."" Bad whistle the entire game, ""well those mistakes you made at the end are the real reason you lost."" You can always tell a Newb, by their unnerving over simple things such as Paskal being grabbed and pushed on an inbound. You fool, that was great D. ESPN told me so. They showed the replay again and again, and even diagramed how it was good ""D"" in slow mo.

Stupid math and stats would have you believe that the amount of paint points the Pacers scored, compared to how many free throws they shot in Game 1 is an historical anomaly and almost mathematically impossible. The same dumb math, would say it's even crazier that Boston shot over 45% of their shots from 3, but shot 20 more free throws than us. Only a crybaby points out that for most the game, every Celtic starter had as many FTs as our entire team (Jayson Tatum alone had 5 times as many FT as all the Pacers combined and the ""slasher"" Al Horford tied us in regulation with three).

The ""Pacer Way"" helps you realize that Boston is just that good on defense. Not just Jrue and D. White either. The entire starting five and BENCH are so elite at defense they only fouled on a single shot attempt up until the 3:18 mark in the 4th quarter (44 minutes into the game, three FT's in the entirety of regulation). Almost reminds me of the vaunted Knicks ""D"" in the last series that went whole quarters without any starter or BENCH player committing a single shooting foul. Real fans take comfort that the refs will always give you a couple of whistles during garbage time, once the game is decided, to sooth your soul and make the numbers look less obvious. The ""Pacer Way"" will help you realize this is a Pacer issue that must be addressed in the off-season. We must draft a player with a ""foulable"" body, because to-a-man, the bodies of the current players are incapable of being fouled.

The ""Pacer Way"" doesn't deal in ""yeah, but"". It's being able to laser focus on what your team did wrong. The last 2 minutes the Pacers were horrible. Turnover after unforced turnover. Rick's coaching decisions. Nembhard NOT just calling a timeout. Hali's horrible three point attempts. Those are exclusively what matters. Never mind that even after all that the score was TIED.

The ""Pacer Way"" does not acknowledge Boston made mistakes too. Their turnovers and bad shot selection down the stretch is fine. I laugh at those that would bring up Jaylen Brown using the same travel three times to score six points. He was only in iso all three times with every player, ref, announcer, a whole stadium, and everyone at home watching him switch pivots. Calling any one of those couldn't have helped. Jaylen Brown grabbing Obi on a alley oop, both hands, while Obi is in  midair and good ol' Tony (a 30 year ref) staring right at them. Hit the weights. Tatum's continuation after T.J. grabbed him on the ground, all in the game my friend, get good.

The ""Pacer Way"" is passionate and stern. It's Pacer fan on Pacers fan, ""keyboard warfare"", ensuring everyone holds the line of not admitting the obvious bias. It patrols reddit to make sure others do not speak of bad calls and referees. You must conform, you must say it was our fault. No thinking ""what if"" they called one single foul in the second or third quarter for the Pacers, just ""maybe"". ""Crying"" is unacceptable.

This was all a tough lesson for my boy at first. He was young and his favorite team had just been ""cheated"" and lost. I sat him down and gave him ""the talk"" about being a Pacer fan. I can't recall the game, the opponent, the call, or even the year when I explained all this to him, but I will never forget his response. He went from a look of supreme sadness to a look of confusion. His nose turned up and he looked me dead in my face and responded, ...

2024-03-30,1711812910,I am so glad Pascal is on the Pacers and getting recognition again finally,"I've been a Raptors fan since the 2016 playoffs and seen since Pascal came into the league. It was so fun to watch them for a while. But what's happened since the 2020 bubble has been frustrating to witness. 

Some history: The Raptors had their best winning percentage in franchise history and Pascal got named an all-star starter. Then the pandemic happened. Most people don't know that between the league's shutdown and the bubble, the guy actually had no gym to practice in at all and was rusty, out of shape, and as the Celtics head coach said, ""had no confidence"". Reports also said apparently he's a guy who was especially germaphobic about it during the pandemic, and just wasn't happy during it all.   He also just seems to play so much better when he's having fun. (Marc Gasol also vanished during the bubble time, couldn't hit any shots. I still wish we could've seen how far they'd go that year in a world with no pandemic.) 

Since then it seems like general opinion of Pascal has been consistently low, because of his poor performance in those playoffs and the lack of team success after. After that season all they've done is bleed talent, and done little to rectify the issue. The best they did was get Precious Achiuwa in a Kyle Lowry sign-and-trade after a disastrous season forced to play in Tampa instead of at home and getting ravaged by COVID across the line-up, then drafted Scottie Barnes. 

Pascal actually had to have shoulder surgery that off-season and wasn't back to full strength until about midway through the season (Fred Vanvleet's all-star year, but he regressed and was worn-down by the insane minutes he had to play by the time Pascal was back into form. I feel like the two of them never were in form at the same time and it's another unfortunate what-if) and they went on a run to get the 5th seed after the all-star break. They faced the sixers in round 1, Scottie and Fred got hobbled by injury, went down 3-0, and Pascal dragged them to a Game 6 where the rest of the team just couldn't do it.

There was high hopes for the next season but they finished 41-41 and lost in the play-in. But that was actually probably Pascal's best year. He played like an MVP candidate for the first 1/3rd to half of the season and one week was even 2nd in the MVP ladder. He was doing that all with terrible spacing on a roster not designed to fit his strengths. But the rest of the team drastically underperformed, littered with regression across the board. He missed all-NBA. 

This whole time the Raptors were making questionable roster decisions that made their spacing and fit even worse. As soon as there were trade rumours I was hoping he'd get sent to the Pacers, a team he'd fit on so much better and is actually making winning decisions and is on the rise. Your guys' team is so fun and I was really happy to see him get traded there while giving up almost nothing for him. I've jumped ship and got NBA League Pass to start watching Pacers games, this team is so exciting, and seeing the acknowledgement of Pascal as a top player instead of the disrespect of people saying he's possibly not even an all-star level talent has made me really happy. I'm hoping the perception of him keeps turning around and that the Pacers can reach high heights as a franchise over these coming years. Tyrese is a special talent and there's so many other great and fun players on this roster. I'm super excited to watch them now and into the future!",pacers,23,https://www.reddit.com/r/pacers/comments/1brkn6m/i_am_so_glad_pascal_is_on_the_pacers_and_getting/

Isnt strength and conditioning a part of a championship? If your players cant stay healthy and get hurt when being out hustled, maybe its time to look at your strength and conditioning and lack of a playoff rotation. Its easy to place blame, but its not so easy to take ownership.

Make the defense chants loud.

Be loud when the Knicks are shooting free throws.

Be quiet when our guys are shooting theirs.

When Brunson starts flopping, start a flopper chant. Hell, start a flopper chant every time he touches the ball, LOL.

When DiVincenzo starts acting like a punk bitch (his version of a tough guy) start a chant about being a bitch, or being soft, etc. You never know if it might get momentum and spread throughout the arena. DiVincenzo seems like the type that would be genuinely and deeply affected by a crowd chanting that he is bitch. 

If/when the refs start their bullshit, let them know about it.

Crowd energy is contagious. If you do your part, it will spread to others.

It goes without saying that this is the most important game of the season by far to this point. **Dont hold back tonight. Make the fieldhouse as hostile as possible for the Knicks.** I want to see the Pacers in the ECF, and tonight is the first step.

2024-05-20,1716242332,What the National Media need to Know about the Pacers,"Since the national media is not going to tell you the story of these Pacers, I will. 

First, I watched every Pacers game this year. And the Celtics were the ONLY team the Pacers played that made me feel like the Pacers were overmatched. And the Pacers still won 2 out of 3 of these games.

Things to know about the Pacers

  
1. They are a young team with almost no playoff experience.

2. They have a historically elite offense.

3. They have an average defense.

4. They played the best teams in the league as well as anyone else this year.

5. They played worst teams in the league as bad as anyone else this year.

6. The Pacers do not play like other teams!

7. They made several trades mid-season. Since then, they have played like one of the best teams in the league.

8. The pacers are deep.

9. The Pacers coaching is elite: They were one of the best teams in the league after a loss. And one of the best third quarter teams. 

Conclusion: This is a young team with elite offensive talent and elite coaching that PLAYS TO THE LEVEL OF THE COMPETITION.

  
A. They play great against great teams.

Here's the Pacers regular season record the against East playoff teams. 

  
Celtics 2-3

Knicks 2-1

Bucks 4-1

Sixers 2-1

Cavs 2-2

Heat 2-1

Magic 1-2

  
If you looked at this, you might be less surprised to see the Pacers in the conference finals.

The Pacers won 47 games this year, but here's their record against the worst teams in the league:



B. They played awful against bad teams



2-2 vs Hornets

2-1 vs Wizards

4-0 vs Pistons

0-2 vs Blazers

2-2 vs Raptors

1-2 vs Grizzlies

1-1 vs Jazz

1-1 vs Spurs

  
13-11.  That's 11 losses to the four worst teams in each conference. 

This is a young team that wasn't consistent against the worst teams, but always played the good teams well.  

They win three or four of those 11 and they are the 2 seed in the East. 

  
C.

  
In the middle of the season the Pacers traded for Pascal. After the all-star break Haliburton was off his minutes restriction. Since that point:

  
Net Rating Post All-Star Break:

Boston: 14.6 

Denver: 9.8

OKC: 7.2

Indiana: 6.3

Knicks: 5.3

That's the two title favorites and the number one seed in the West and then the Pacers. 

  
Post the all-star break:

Boston wins: 21

Knick and Magic wins: 17

Pacers  and Heat wins: 16

Since the All star break:

  
The Pacers were the 2nd best offense in the league (and in history). An elite elite offense. 

And they were the 18th best defense. An average defense.

But as someone who was watching all the games, i can tell you that the Pacers were getting better at defense every week. But the end of the season they were regularly playing like the 10-12th best defense in the league. Though as a young team, again, they would take games off which would blow up their net rating.  

  
OFFENSE:

  
This team has the second best offense in league history.

They do it with elite distribution. 

TEAM ASSISTS

Pacers: 30.8

Spurs: 29.9

Nuggets: 29.5

Warriors: 29.3

  
Now look at the playoffs:

Pacers 31 (!)

Nuggets: 24.9

Lakers: 24.4

  
You will here national media give lazy takes like ""Haliburton needs to score more"" or ""Pascal needs to show up."" Or whatever. The Pacers problem has never been their offense. Maybe that changes in the next round, but the Pacers will probably win the game if the can defend and rebound at an above average level.

  
Playoff offense rating:

Pacers 121.7

Celtics: 118.8

Knicks: 118.1

""The Pacers are attempting 31.0 wide open shots per game in the playoffs.  
  
The gap between IND and the 2nd most wide-open FGA/g among remaining teams (OKC21.6) is greater than the gap between 2nd &amp; last (BOS14.4)  
  
Pacers offense generating an OUTRAGEOUS amount of wide open looks""  


This is a historically good offense and it's built on getting open looks for everybody, starters and bench. 

I don't have the stats, but the Pacers winning formula is 6 or more guys in double figures. 

A lot of people's skepticism about the Pacers was that this was NOT GOOD PLAYOFF BASKETBALL.

So far that has not been true. 

  
YOUTH:

  
The Pacers have the 7th youngest team in the league. 

Their playoff rotation so far:

1 rookie

1 second year player

1 third year player

3 fourth year players

Other than Pascal the team has no recognizable playoff experience.

This is the biggest reason to be skeptical of them in:

  
THE PLAYOFFS

  
Other than experience the above suggests the Pacers being the second best team in the East is not shocking.

  
ROUND 1

Game 1 on the road vs Bucks.  Dame Lillard goes off, The Pacers looks terrified. They get crushed. 

The Pacers proceed to win 4 out of the next 5, 3 by double digits and they were up 20 in the 4th game and won in OT.

The one loss was on the road up 3-1. A classic let down game for a young team with no playoff experience.

  
ROUND 2

  
Game 1: They have clearly learned from the first round. The play this game to a draw and the refs decide to lean on it for the Knicks.

Game 2: A weird game where Jalen Brunson goes out with an injury and then comes back and then OG goes out with an injury. 

Obviously this is a challenge for the Knicks, but most people don't understand how hard this is for a young team on the road. The game plan goes out the window, and then comes back in, and then goes out again. You could see the lack of experience showing.

  
UP TO THIS POINT, the Pacers were very good at between game adjustments n the playoffs, but not great at within game adjustments.

  
NOTES ON GAMES 1 and 2: National media, Simmons and Russillo, The Hoop Collective, go on and on about how obvious it is to put Nesmith on Brunson and take Nembhard off. They are unaware that Nesmith was even worse on Brunson than Nembhard in the regular season AND got in huge foul trouble on top of that.

The Pacers defensive adjustments on Brunson was much more than switching the primary defender. They did a lot more hedging, spontaneous doubling, icing, sitting on Brunson's left etc...   

Aggressive doubling of Brunson never worked great because 1) The Pacers are not a great offensive team in rotation and 2) Staying home on your man was the only way the Pacers could keep the Knicks off the offensive glass. 

Let Brunson get his points, just make it as hard as possible, was an intentional strategy by the Pacers and it was the right one.

The pacers proceeded (again) to win 4 of the next 5 against the Knicks. Again, three of them by double digits and one won on a last second game winner. This time Nembhard.

Once again, the Pacers had one bad game where they let up on the road and got destroyed in game 5.

Of course OG being out made this all easier for the Pacers, but you could see the Pacers making adjustments game by game.

  
NOTES on GAME 6: This may turn out to be the most important game of the series for next round.  This is the first game where the Pacers made consistent aggressive in game adjustments that worked. The Pacers are growing up before our eyes.

GAME 7: Young Pacers team shows not an ounce of nerves (except Obi Toppin) in obliterating the league record for FG% in a playoff game. And they do it on the road in a game 7 in MSG.

  
SPEAKING OF INJURIES:

The Pacers have gotten better and better throughout the season, this is despite Tyrese Haliburton being injured since the all-star break. He has not looked like himself most of the second half of the season. 

He was listed as questionable with Back Spasms the last three games of the Bucks series and the first game of the Knicks series.

WHAT DOES THIS PACER TEAM LOOK LIKE WITH EARLY SEASON HALIBURTON?

Game 7 might have been a hint.

  
THE CELTICS:

With about a month to go in the regular season, I made a bet that the Pacers would make the ECF. Not because I was sure they would, but because it was pretty clear they had as a good a shot as anyone that wasn't the Celtics. And they were getting better game by game.

As I said, the Celtics are better than the Pacers and they were the only team East or West that made me think the Pacers have a way to go. But the Celtics did that to a lot of teams. 

  
But the second half of the season Pacers are 1) won at a 50 game pace with an injured Hali and still losing games to bottom feeders they shouldn't lose to 2) Played elite offense with acceptable defense: this the root the Nuggets took last year to win a ring and the Lebron cavs took in the weak east of the past. 

Obviously the Pacers do not (yet) have an MVP level player, this will be closer than people think.

  
The pacers are unbeaten at home in the playoffs. The Pacers get a lot of open shots. They hit them when they are home.

Game 7, they hit them on the road. What will see against the Celtics?

  
The two games the Pacers won against the Celtics were due to Celtics failing at late game execution. This is widely thought to be the Celtics weak point. 

  
And this is their only hope against the Celtics.



How would the Pacers beat the Celtics if they do? A FAN FANTASY

  
Game 1: Celtics not ready for the intensity the Pacers have coming off game 7 win and get stunned. Pacers bench is plus 22

Game 2: Celtics win easy. Hit 21 threes. SERIES 1-1

Game 3 and 4: Pacers shoot lights out in both games and win one blowout and one close one. PACERS 3-1

Game 5: Celtics finally turn up the defense out of desperation. Pacers overwhelmed. Get crushed. TJ McConnel is too small. The bench falls apart. Haliburton is beat up. Have the Celtics found the formula?

Game 6: Celtics talent starting to win out. They've figured out they have to turn the Pacers over and have to hammer Hali on the defensive end. They win a close one on the road.

Game 7:  Everyone thinks this series is over (again), but game 7s are messy and the Pacers get a Hali game (8-11 from three) and keep it close to the very end. Tie game: Tatum misses a fall away three to win. seven seconds left. Hali looks to make a last second shot, but tosses an alley-oop to Turner for the win.

Kinda curious on everyones opinion? The referees, at times, throughout both games were obnoxious and favored. I dont think its the only reason we lost. At least not in game 2.

Im just worried were too focused on the calls. It sucks, believe me, but were a small market team and we really gotta out perform if we want any chance to win. 

Im curious on everyones opinion though

2024-03-13,1710304473,Thank the good lord we got Pascal Siakam,"Before we traded for Pascal, I honestly believed wed be just fine without him. Our offense was humming. But Siakam has really impressed me recently. Several times tonight, I found myself wondering what we would have done if he wasnt there. He has become essential. What he did tonight:

1. When the pace slows down, he is a steady presence. I loved our style of play in the first half of the year, but we had a glaring hole in needing someone who could really create their own shot. Siakam has filled that role, and it will be absolutely essential for a playoff grind. 

2. He reminded me of David West tonight. Obviously his style of play is different (Siakam is way more athletic at this point in his career than West was when we had him), but they are similar insofar as when we need a bucket after a tough stretch, we can reliably go to him. He also has the experience and gravitas West had with younger guys.

3. His experience is apparent. I hadnt really noticed the downside of having such a young team before, but Siakam offers a contrast that makes our youth more noticeable. For example, at one point near the end of the game tonight, Haliburton was going nuts trying to get the ball so he could facilitate. The defense was sticking to him, though, and it looked for a second like wed turn the ball over trying to get it to him. Siakam basically motioned Haliburton offPascal was capable of dribbling through the defense and facilitating himself, in this tough situation. I dont think anybody else on the team would have done that, but it was the right call. Siakam settled things down, and we got the bucket.

4. The dude is just fun to watch. He does things that a guy his size just shouldnt be doing. Particularly, his touch and razzle dazzle in the paint

Were not going to be able to get revenge on the court. The only time wed be able to is in the Finals, and as much as Id love that, odds are against it. 

What if we take Bronny at 50, stash him deeeeeep on the bench and then cut him as soon as Lebron retires? If Lebron wants him bad enough, he pays a Kings ransom. If not, it at least sours Lebrons relationship with the Lakers front office, and possibly destroys his relationship with his son.

2024-05-09,1715222163,Thoughts,"1) We deserved to lose. We got out hustled by a hungrier team.

2) Obi and McConnell need more minutes. They are hustling, playing great D, hitting shots and not backing down. They have both been on fire lately and have arguably been our two best players this series.

2) Someone needs to teach the pacers how to box out. You dont have to be in the perfect position for the rebound, you just need to make sure the other person is boxed out. We seem to not know this.

3) For the love of god stop leaving DiVincenzo wide open from 3. He will hit them.

4) Siakam has been arguably our worst player, starter of bench, since game 3 of the Milwaukee series.

5) Haliburton was more aggressive but he needs to be even more aggressive. Giving up wide open looks from 5-10 feet away to pass it out to 3 cant be the go to.

2024-01-17,1705526465,You guys got a special player in Siakam,"Hey just wanted to give my perspective as a Raptors fan on what you guys are getting in Siakam. He has been carrying the Raptors offence the past several years with very crowded spacing where he is driving into 5 defenders and still scoring. His ability to wiggle through space, stretch out and score at the rim is unlike any other player in the league which makes him a very tough cover for most teams. He is also a very good mid range shooter, and an above average defender. Even though his 3 point shooting isnt amazing he can still space the floor and knock em down, especially from the corners. We really did not build a good team around him in Toronto and so I think he is undervalued by a lot of fans around the league. With the Pacers spacing and with Haliburton diming him up, his efficiency should improve. Also hes just a hard worker overall, first guy in the gym, last guy out. I also think he will re-sign given that hes not the type of guy who craves a big market team, he just wants to win. I will definitely be tuning into a lot more Pacers games in the future, you guys are a lot closer to contenders now after this trade!",pacers,50,https://www.reddit.com/r/pacers/comments/19984ie/you_guys_got_a_special_player_in_siakam/

IE, Suns with two superstars and three all stars out in the first round= Horrible coaching

The opposite is also true
I mean, the Knicks were fairly mid. But this team all year beat teams with a LOT more talent than ours.  We are two years into a rebuild and in the ECF playing a team that's 14 games better than the second best team.  A team with a NET of 11.  And a team with over 30 wins against above .509 teams.

They have two superstars and 4 all star caliber players.  (Maybe even 5).  

Having a chance to win where the second best players have been Myles Turner (game 3) or Pascal (game 1 and 2) is amazing.  That's a huge gap in talent and he's overachieved by that measure

Not saying he didn't make a mistake in game 1 not calling a TO, but that's the only cardinal sin I can see.  The overall job has been absolutely amazing

Who here thought we'd be playing basketball at this point in the year? I'm starting to think that people might have been happier if we didn't even make playoffs. We've got one of the youngest teams in the NBA, most of which haven't played a single minute of playoffs basketball before this season, and we are still two games out of the ECF. Not a God damned soul expected us to make it this far, and if anything it should be a blessing, knowing that our team is only going to improve over the next 2-3 years. THIS ISN'T EVEN OUR WINDOW, and yet we are still competing.

We've speedrun the rebuild to build a fun and competitive squad, and you fucks are ruining it like we were expected to win the championship from day 1. We aren't the Celtics, even if we lose on Friday, this season should be looked at positively. 

It's absolutely okay to be critical and have discussions talking about player performances, I get that, but some of you doomers out here sound like Knicks'/Bucks' sleeper agents.

14.3 PPG/4.8APG/3.0 RPG on 61.1%/53.3%/72.2% splits, and he has done this with the LOWEST usage rate on our entire team, at 12.9%. He also has turned the ball over only once so far in the series.

His advanced stats are no different. Andrew's offensive rating is 155, which is second out of ALL qualified players in the playoffs. He also is third on our team in +/- on/off, with a +22.8.

I've consistently been impressed by his play since we drafted him; he is seemingly always in the correct spot at the correct time, and him showing that he is the type of player that elevates his game in the playoffs has only been more impressive to watch.

Edit: Basketball reference wasn't completely updated when I posted, Andrew has the highest offensive rating of all players in the playoffs, with 155. Nikola Jokic is 2nd with 144.",pacers,53,https://www.reddit.com/r/pacers/comments/1cg2f2a/andrew_nembhard_is_the_unhearalded_mvp_of_this/

2024-05-21,1716250062,Our Side of the Story...,"Seeing as the media coverage has been a tad slanted, I thought I would put together a list of things from the Pacer's version of events of the last couple days:

1.) Knicks wore black to Game 6 ""funeral"" for Pacers at Gainbridge. Got smacked. No talk of ""frontrunning"".

2.) For all the talk of how well the Knicks played. They got blown out 3 times in the series, everyone outside of N.Y. knows they were gifted Game 1, and lost on a buzzer beater.  5-2 series, in which you got smoked 3 times, historically, ain't really a moral victory.

3.) ""They"" are trying to pull a ""chicken-egg"" with the injuries for the Knicks and rewrite history. Knicks didn't play bench players because they weren't good enough.  Starters play 48 minutes a game. Starters go down, multiple bench players  (who weren't good enough to play not one minute) drop 20 pieces. Thibbs should have played his bench before he ran his starters to death.

4.) Burke was getting a Jordan whistle and at one point shot more free throws than our entire team.

5.) The amount of points we score in the paint while not shooting free throws needs to be investigated. We don't JUST shoot jumpers, we attack the paint relentlessly. We only had 5 free throws in the first half  (0 in first quarter) of Game 7, a half that we scored 70 points. In Game 4 blowout, we shot three free throws in almost three quarters.

6.) For all the tough talk, J.B. and D.D. are world-class floppers and the refs/league allowed it for seven games without ever calling them out for it.

7.) Shout out to Rick for working the back handed compliment into the press conference acknowledging how they pushed us in back whole series on rebounds, uncalled.

8.) Jalen Brunson spun and fell, that was not a foul

9.) DiVincenzo slipped and fell, that was not a foul.

10.) J.J. Redick and Doris, on live t.v., having a minute long conversation about how good players catch you with ""your hand in the cookie jar"" after showing a replay where Ben Sheppard didn't reach at all is a special kind of bias.

11.) Showing a replay of one common foul from three different cameras until you find an angle to show were Neismith MIGHT have grazed JB is a special kind of bias. 

12.) All the experts that picked the Knicks to win before the game, knew the Knicks were injured. After the Knicks lost, they blamed it on the injuries.

13.) Rick ran a 10 man rotation all year. Trying to keep players healthy and getting players experience is a part of coaching. Thibbs saw OG run before the game and put him out there. We all saw him run. Is the coach who put OG out there a coach worried about player health?

14.) Myles Turner got two handed pushed in his back by IHart when he was jumping for a dunk attempt and three refs just watched. No whistle.

15.) Siakam was given a tech for getting pushed by DiVincenzo. If the tech was for interaction with Ihart, instigated by IHart, then IHart should have received tech too. Either way, Pacers should have had a free throw.

16.) Hali outplayed the newly crowned King of N.Y. Both had two bad games. Both were injured, only one's injuries were allowed as an excuse or even discussed. Hali doesn't flop. Hali doesn't foul bait. Hali gets his team involved and doesn't play hero ball. J.B. missed important free throws, again and again. Hali showed up in Game 7, Brunson was stinking up the joint, even before he got hurt. Hali outshined him and won.

17.) One of the halftime ""points"" for the ESPN halftime show dealt with Knicks closing out Pacers. We were up 15. (Game 6, they played the Knicks theme song at halftime, Knicks were down 10).

18.) DiVincenzo told Hali that he only talks crazy when the Pacers are winning. DiVincenzo only talked crazy when the Knicks were winning.

19.) Hali was raining shot after shot in first three quarters of Game 7. Montage put together of his highlights was of him talking crazy to fans, not his shots.  He had hit five threes and had 21 points, 6 minutes into the 3rd, when they showed it. 

20.) Your Indiana Pacers went into Madison Square Garden for a Game 7 and despite the fans, the media, and the refs put on the BEST SHOOTING PERFORMANCE IN THE HISTORY OF PLAYOFF BASKETBALL. No asterisk. No fake stat. Not the best in May, or best for the Pacers, or best in the Garden. The best ever.

2024-04-28,1714348326,Myles Turner Appreciation Post,"

I just wanted to remind everyone of what Myles Turner has had to endure with this franchise over the years, and his understanding and patience should absolutely be taken into account just as much as his on-court performance.

Starting on draft night. We could only get him because it was the down-year when PG broke his leg. Still, the Pacers were fairly solid without their best player and only missed the playoffs by losing to the Grizzlies on the last night of the season. 

Now, if youre Myles getting drafted by the Pacers, youre salivating at the possibility of a healthy PG leading the team to another deep playoff run. Also, you get to play with and learn from Roy, DWest and Luis Scola.

Except, when he actually got here, those guys were all gone. Instead, the bigs on the roster were rookie Rakeem Christmas, sophomore Shayne Whittington, Lavoy Allen, and Jordan Hill. No disrespect to any of those guys, but seriously, imagine if Myles had been schooled by Roy, DWest and Scola. His bag would be incredible. 

Still even with a roster that saw 8 guys leave and 8 guys enter year over year, the Pacers made the playoffs again but lost in seven to the Raptors.

That offseason, Frank Vogel was out, and Nate McMillan was in. Another playoff appearance but a first round sweep this time (Cleveland).

In his second season, Turner started 81 games, and averaged 14.5 PPG on 10.7 FGA. 

Then came a huge shift. PG was out, Vic and Domas were in. 

The immediate effect of Domas arrival on Myles game was 3 fewer minutes per game and 2 fewer FGA, resulting in about 2 fewer PPG. Things got better for Myles in the second year of the pairing, but clearly his role with the team was not progressing the way a young player would like. 

Which is what makes Turner re-signing with the Pacers, on a team-friendly deal, such a big deal. This dude really put team before self when he couldve gone elsewhere and tried to improve his numbers. But knowing that his play was going to be affected by Domas presence, he agreed to defer of offense, and take the more difficult defensive assignment. 

For 5 seasons playing with Domas, this guy who scored 14.5 a game in his second season consistently put up 12-13 points never again getting as shot attempts as he did in that second year. 

The team made the playoffs some but never advanced, then things seemed to get worse and worse with injuries and coaching changes. And lets not forget about the fan hate and endless trade rumors. 

And Myles Turner stayed calm, cool, and patient through it all.

Enter Tyrese Haliburton. With Domas gone, and Ty here to unlock Myles potential. The most patient man in Indy seemingly overnight became a 17.5 PPG scorer on an efficient 12 shots per game. Back to back career years, and now, finally back in the Playoffs and having some success. 

This dude is an absolute treasure and worth so much. The organization has to re-sign him next year and never let him leave.

- Haliburtons ambitions in Indianapolis were first stoked in 2023 during the annual Indy 500 Festival parade. While riding in the back of a 1993 Camaro, he took in the massive crowds lining the citys streets.
I was sitting there and I was like, Dude, if we win a championship in Indiana& he says, trailing off in thought. Take that parade and double it, triple it. People in Indiana love basketball. So yeah, I think about it a lot.

- I'm gonna be around for a long time, he says, and I have full faith in that. and I gotta prove that, of course, but I guess my biggest thing is, like: this is not a one-time thing, by any means.


- I'm coming into this year, and whether it's the case or not, viewing it like everybody thinks my success in the first half of last season was a fluke, and I got to prove it again, Haliburton says. And that's just who I am and that's how I'm just cut that way. That's the fun part about it for me: it's just another chip on my shoulder, [added] to the thousands that are already there.

- Early in the year I was in such a good place mentally, physicallythe best place I've ever been in my career, he says. Just feeling like I woke up, went to the gym every day, like, nobody can fuck with me, you know? It's just kind of where my mentality was.
Then, in January, he injured his hamstring, which kind of hindered everything else, because now Im thinking twice about everything, he says. When that healed, he also dealt with back pain that has lingered since he was a teenager, and that locked up so severely before one road game in Charlotte that he could not leave his hotel bed.
