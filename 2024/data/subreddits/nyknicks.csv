2024-04-26,1714137547,League should suspend Embiid for game 4. ,"I know Im going to sound like a crying broken record. 

Yes we got away with a win in game two because of this and that, however be that as it may, committing 5 crazy shameful fouls in a game does  not compare to the refs missing calls. 

Dude bumps OG(illegal screen) doesnt get called but obviously made a harsh move to push him.  

Hits Divo in the face 

Pulls Robinsons leg and claims he was triggered from a previous games similar situation. Smh so fucking roll away if you dont want him to fall on you. Pulling his leg is only going to for sure increase the chance of him falling on you. Fucking liar. 

Kicks Robinson in the groin  in another play. That could have been an accident but still thats a foul. 

Kicks hart in the groin and its reviewed. 

He needs to be suspended one game.  Other wise the league is setting a precedent that this kind of behavior is okay if you are a star or if the previous game the refs blew a call. 

Knowing Dolan, he should sue.

2024-05-21,1716321316,A Humble Bostonian Coming in Peace,"My New York brothers I come before you, not with words of war, but a proposal. It is no secret between our kind, that in the world of professional sports, we do not like each other. And in the world of the world, we also do not like each other.

But my North East bretheren, we were robbed. Our city's rivalry has been for decades centered in baseball and football, and the flames of this rivalry have long gone unfanned. We were given an opportunity, an opportunity to renew this hatred on the court and on the ice, the dominions of our cities' rivalry which have sat by the wayside for eons. Yes, the Celtics and Knicks of old did battle and yes, the Rangers and Bruins of a bygone time met in the frozen waste. But the tales we will tell our children of our history will be one of diamonds and gridiron.

We could have had it different. We could have had the Celtics and Knicks in the ECF, and at the same time had the Bruins and Rangers in the ECF.

It's true. It's not the same anymore between us. The Yankees and Red Sox don't fight each other on the field anymore. The Giants and the Patriots are a long way from the Super Bowl, and now we sit at the bottom of the AFC East with the Jets while the Dolphins and Bills have surpassed us. The vigorous hate our city once had for New York sports has given way to a mere dislike.

But New York, I'm going to be honest with you. We miss it.

We miss the fighting. We miss waking up in the morning renewed with the knowledge that after we got home from work and school we would stay up late in the hopes that we would see our city crush the hopes and dreams of children all around New York. We miss the 0-3 jokes, we miss the Eli is our dad jokes, we miss Mark Sanchez.

And we think you do too. Because lets just be honest here. We're better than them. We are the frigid and somehow also blistering hot corner of this nation that has our act together. Yes we have our issues, our homes cost a million dollars and our subway systems are pathetic but have you even seen the rest of this place? Florida is underwater two months of the year. Philadelphia watches people eat rotisserie chickens for fun. Los Angeles is plastic, and Indiana is just not an important place.

Yes, the Panthers beat the Bruins, and we all went to sleep Friday knowing that alligators were not somehow only our fourth biggest problem. And yes, the Pacers beat the Knicks, and you all went to sleep knowing that your city was a better place than Indianapolis. I don't actually know anything about Indianapolis to make this a better joke because as I mentioned earlier, not an important place.

We could have brought new life to only truly great rivalry this country has ever seen. Because what else is there? The Saints and the Falcons? Those people don't even have teeth.

That new life to our eternal struggle was taken from us, and it was taken by Indiana and Florida.

So my proposal to you, good people of r/NYKicks is that for one round, and one round only. We do the unthinkable. We unite. If you root for the Celtics in r/nba we will root for the Rangers in r/hockey

This offer of truce extends to the conference finals and no further. We will not ask you to wish a new banner upon us, and we will not wish one upon you. The United States of America has never known greater sports cities than New York and Boston and they have could never imagine how unbelievably toxic we could manage to be if for two weeks we did the unthinkable, we stood together.

This isn't how we wanted this New York. We wanted to fight. We wanted to pour gasoline on the fire. Not in an oil drum under an overpass like they do in the lesser parts of this country, but pour gasoline into the heart and soul of the greatest rivalry sports will ever know and lets make those stupid fucks regret taking it from us.",NYKnicks,227,https://www.reddit.com/r/NYKnicks/comments/1cxh3r0/a_humble_bostonian_coming_in_peace/

Wrong. [Here](https://streamable.com/kq4xd5) you can clearly see Nurse put his arms up to CALL timeout but never does. In fact, he puts his hands down once Lowry inbounds the ball. Poorly at that. Great pass loser

*""NURSE CALLED TIMEOUT WHEN MAXEY HAD POSSESSION AND THE REF IGNORED HIM""*

Also wrong. God dammit just use your eyes! [Here](https://streamable.com/q8exv4) we see Maxey fall with the ball. Nurse IMMEDIATELY looks to the refs to call time out but Maxey **ALREADY LOST THE BALL** to Hart. The ref waived it off because Maxey no longer had possession

2024-09-28,1727498721,What to Expect from Karl-Anthony Towns,"Minnesota Timberwolves fan here, coming very much in peace. One of my best friends is a huge Knicks fan and you were already my favorite team in the East before this trade.

I'm absolutely devastated to lose KAT, both as a basketball player, but most importantly as one of best and most unfairly maligned dudes in the NBA.

We're talking about a guy who returned 3 weeks early from a terrible meniscus injury, played through the pain and was our primary defender of KD and Jokic in back to back playoff series wins in a sweep against the Suns and beating the defending champions in a Game 7 away from home.

Not only that, but he's been through hell since he joined the league, playing for some of the worst teams of all time, losing several family members including his mom to Covid and then on top of that had to see his public perception ruined by an asshole who actually got NBA fans/media on his side as well... FJB.

Through all of that shit, he has never asked to leave, kept his positive attitude and been one of the best dudes you'll ever know. Don't mistake kindness for softness. He's been through so much shit and come out stronger.

He gladly accepted supporting Ant as the team's new best player, just like he will for Brunson and he adapted to an entirely new position at PF after the team traded for Gobert to be the new center of the team. KAT's defence took a huge step up last season and he was, like I mentioned, successfully the primary defender against KD and Jokic back to back.

It hurts so bad to see him leave, I really wanted to see him win a title with Minnesota, but I'm very happy that he has ended up in New York, close to where he grew up, with a fanbase that loves their players hard and give anyone that tries to hurt them a bad time. Fuck Trae Young and fuck Jimmy Butler.

Take good care of him and we'll take good care of Don Julio and The Big Ragu. It sucks seeing long time favorites go, but hopefully they thrive even more in a new environment.

2024-05-11,1715442663,Thank you Mike Breen,For sticking up for the Knicks during the broadcast when the seemingly media narrative has been against the Knicks. He refuted the narrative that Nesmith was locking up Brunson by bringing up the fact that Brunson  wasnt getting his usual lift on his shots (maybe his foot issue).  He offered the explanation about Alec Burks struggles connected with separation from his family because they were still in Detroit (that JJ co-signed on). And I believed he sneaked in a Dontes Inferno during the broadcast.  I hope he is on for more of the Knick playoff games. Its worth putting up with Doris to hear Mike. ,NYKnicks,139,https://www.reddit.com/r/NYKnicks/comments/1cpkh3o/thank_you_mike_breen/
