2024-05-03,1714747249,How many of you agree that letting Jimmy go feels like a huge mistake.,"Im not here to argue with anyone.

I get that hes getting older but its not like hes showing real signs of falling off. If he was injured last season before the playoffs we would be sitting here having this conversation last year. He averaged the same regular season numbers as he has for the past three seasons, with real improvement with his 3pt shot and a similar record to last season. Do we forget that he lead us to the finals just last year? We were hoping to sign Dame last season to have him and Jimmy play out Dames contract together. Now a year later its time to move on? Jimmy Butler is consistently a border line all-nba caliber player in the regular season and in recent years I would argue hes at least a top 5 player in the playoffs. Hes consistently outperformed guys that are regarded as MVP contenders (Tatum, Embiid).  

Lets talk about his playing style. Sure hes incredibly athletic, but his game is slow, methodical and about him getting to his spots. His athleticism may drop off, but his IQ and strength are what he relies most on. Not to mention his impact as a leader on this team. 

And one last thing, from a fans perspective - this guy has given his all to this team, hes a Heat guy and if two years ago after he missed the shot in game 7, or last year after bringing us to the finals, you knew that people were confidently saying its time to go youd assume he fell off big time. It feels a bit like when Wade came back to Miami, Jimmy belongs in a Heat jersey, even if you may not think its the smartest decision.",heat,139,https://www.reddit.com/r/heat/comments/1cjacgz/how_many_of_you_agree_that_letting_jimmy_go_feels/

Hes as advertised, head coach Erik Spoelstra said of Larsson. Hes an elite role player. If you mention that to some organizations, they probably think that thats horrible. I think it fits absolutely with our style of play, our culture, how we view players and how they impact winning. He knows how to defend multiple positions, he brings you physicality on that side of the floor. Offensively, he moves very well without the ball, so he could be a connector with whatever unit he plays. And also, hes been really working diligently on his shooting.

As Chiang notes, Larsson may not receive consistent rotation minutes when the roster is fully healthy, but hes doing his best to make it a difficult decision for Spoelstra.

Just that I can make winning plays, Larsson said when asked what he wants to prove this preseason. Theyre not going to put anyone out there who doesnt show that. Thats the first thing they look for. And then if you can knock down open shots, theyll be really happy. But the main thing is making winning plays  on the ball and off the ball. As a cutter, as a passer, whatever it is, just stack up winning plays.

Extremely unprofessional to say the least. Saying garbage on air like Ive done my fair share of hating Tyler Herro. Whaaaa???? What kind of man child says shit like this on live TV, let alone an ex player. 

0 basketball insight. 0 stats. 0 preparation.

Their guys literally do the bare minimum all the while being insane homers and nothing else. No flare&.no extra tidbits&.no chemistry between the 2. My girl fell asleep within the 1st quarter&.at 4pm. 

Naturally I switched it to E. Reid and Crotty and holy hell the change in energy and complete know-how on what the job entails is unmatched. Actually felt like a gaddamn playoff game. 

Never take our broadcast team for granted Heat nation.

I know, in my heart and my soul, Jimmy has to win the ring with us. This is what they make movies about. Jimmy NEEDS to be there for us in the post-season if he is going to play dominoes and drink coffee all day. He is the lifeblood and we need to channel our energy into him, on some Legends of Zelda shit. 

Bam Adebayo needs to stay because I can instantly tell by his name he is good. You can't have a name like that and not be good at basketball. Bam! Wham bam ding dang. He gonna hit you from the both the front and the back court. With a name like that, you think he'd carry a flinstones looking ass club with him on the court and just bonk people on the head with it. 

Tyler Herro has evil energy man. When I picture him I just picture tequila and money (in a bad way). Him starting is affecting our purity. His chest tattoo make me think he is a NPC MyCareer player or something. He can ball but his energy is off. 

Rozier reminds me of my old coworker at my very first job so he def gotta stay. 

DUNCAN!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

I have no idea what our team can do to move forward. They need to like have a team night where they play xbox and bro down and get the vibes right again. If that doesn't work then what will?

2024-04-20,1713576097,"The Heat will beat the Celtics, here's why","**1. Jaime Jaquez Jr. fills the Jimmy Butler role**

While Jimmy Butler is the most important player on the team, the Heat get more out of Jaquez when Butler is out because the two guys like to fill the same spots on the floor, which makes it difficult for them to play together. While Jaquez won't have the 30, 40, and 50 point playoff explosions that Butler is capable, he will have some nice 20-28 point games against the Celtics in round 1.

**2. Bam Adebayo's Three Point Shots**

The Miami Heat are built in the mold of the 2004 NBA Champion Detroit Pistons. One of the deadly things  from that Pistons offense was Rasheed Wallace leaking out to the top of the key and splashing open threes. The Bam three point shot is here and there's going to be a game where Bam hits 4 threes against the Celtics.

**3. Heat have the best playoff Defense**

The Miami Heat finished with the 5th best defense in the league after starting slow on that side of the ball. As we've seen through two play-in games, the Heat still arguably have the best playoff defense in the league.

**4. The Caitlin Clark Effect**

Caitlin Clark has re-instilled the belief in White Americans that they can be good at basketball too. As a result, Tyler Herro, Kevin Love, and Duncan Robinson are poised to have a monster playoffs this year. For the Celtics, this will inspire Hauser and Pritchard to try to do way too much, despite not having the talent of the Heat's White Americans. 

**5. The Return of Playoff Jimmy**
