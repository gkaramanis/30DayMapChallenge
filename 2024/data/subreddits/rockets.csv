Reed was abusing drop coverage vs LAL and WAS and Detroit came and challeneged him by playing up on him and doubling him. Reed still played pretty well (Cam is another story), but I hope tomorrow's game we can see Reed counter those defensive coverages or if that will be a summer project for him. Also Griffin played pretty well vs. Detroit too.

2024-05-25,1716611236,"If Reed is there at 3, hell be a Rocket. A summary of the future Core 7:","Okay, okay& Im convinced... Reed will be coming to Houston.

Atlanta will probably not be drafting a guard and Sarr or Risacher are the only ones being mocked at #1.

Wizards will go Sarr or Clingan to solve immediate problems and hold out for a playmaker in the 2025 draft. They could also go Risacher is they think hes BPA. Reed wouldnt be a good fit there.

Houston doesnt need this pick to hit, and its already loaded with lengthy defenders, so it can afford to take a chance on an undersized guy with incredible talents that complement the young core. You could easily make a case that the best fit may also be BPA in Reed Sheppard. If youre Stone, you almost cant avoid drafting Reed. If he doesnt live up to the hype, the narrative will be that it was a weak draft, we were supposed to have the 9th pick anyway, the analytics said he was the right choice, and a sniper is still makes the team better even if hes just a role player. If Stone passes on Reed and he hits, hell be crucified for passing on him.

Although I love Castle as a prospect, Im seeing the writing on the wall and Im ready to accept it. Reed will round out a Core 7 for the Houston Rockets. If he turns out to be 80% of the hype surrounding him, hell be great for this team.

Heres a look at what this Core 7 group consists of with an elevator pitch for each guy:

**Jalen: ** Twitchy but smooth 3-level scorer who can pressure the rim, get hot from deep, and dominate a game with bouncy athleticism, elite body control, and a deep bag of shot creation - if he finds consistency and confidence, he could be an All-NBA level talent.

**Alpi: ** Steady post player who uses his strength, balance, deceptive wiggle, and gravity to misdirect defenses and create advantages for himself and his teammates - if he continues to improve his defense and shooting confidence, hell be one of the top-five most skilled centers in the league.

**Jabari: ** Big/wing hybrid with size and shooting who grabs boards, defends at a high level, and has an unguardable middie - hes already on his way to being an elite role player, but if he puts on strength and learns how to harness his clutch gene, hell be even more dangerous.

**Tari: ** Lengthy and explosive defensive playmaker who can change the momentum of the game the moment he steps on the court turning defense into offense with seemingly boundless energy &amp; is very active on the offensive glass - if he reaches his Kawhi ceiling, hes a very rare 2-way talent.

**Amen: ** Basketball genius with unicorn-level size and athleticism who processes the game at lightning speed, can move just as fast, and wreaks havoc all over the court on defense - if he develops a respectable shot, its over for the league.

**Cam: ** Strong athletic finisher with a shooting touch who can score in bunches and doesnt shy away from contact - if he keeps improving his existing strengths while adding a playmaking component to his bag, hell be unstoppable.

**Reed: ** Lights out deep threat with sneaky athleticism, an overclocked processor, impeccable timing, and accurate passing ability whos pesky in passing lanes and spaces the floor, punishing defenses by finding easy looks for his teammates - if the hype is real and his skill set translates, hes the perfect puzzle piece to round out the Core 7 &amp; completes a trio of high IQ players with Amen and Alpi.

With a trio of high-IQ guys and a trio of incredible athletes plus two complementary wings, the Rockets could be one of the most complete teams as early as next season.

2024-07-15,1721076716,I feel like the Rockets are so slept on currently,"Tari only played 22 games last season and will hopefully play at least 60 games next season.

Sengun missed the last 19 games of the season and hopefully continues on improving and plays 75+ games.

Jalen played like a legitimate all-star caliber player towards the end of the season.

We drafted the best player in the draft so far who fits our team perfectly (its been only 2 summer league games I know=-)

We got Steven Adams OFF THE BENCH next season.

We also got AJ Griffin who could be a decent shooting wing off the bench.

We finished the season with 41-41 record and have only got better during the off-season.

Seriously like if things go right were a respectable playoff team next season. IM SO EXCITED.

2024-03-08,1709893517,A Wholesome Story About Hakeem Olajuwon,"2010 World championship was in Turkey. Turkish basketball commentator Murat Murathanoglu's dream was to bring 4 great players from 4 continents and interview them. The players were; Yao Ming, Oscar Schmidt, Arvydas Sabonis and Hakeem Olajuwon.

First they called Hakeem's manager and he agreed. But they soon realized that the budget had grown too much, they were working with Rebook and FIBA also opposed this organization and they had to cancel it. He sadly called Hakeem's manager and told him that the event was canceled and they had no money anymore.

Two hours later, Murat's phone rang, it was Hakeem's manager and he told him, ""Hakeem wants to come, money isn't important, just arrange a driver and a car.""

And for the 2010 World Championships, Hakeem came to Turkey for free.

He told this story on their YouTube channel , and I translated it from there. [Source.](https://youtu.be/etGObzYfp40?si=XIBGp6w3JiW784aC&amp;t=684)",rockets,5,https://www.reddit.com/r/rockets/comments/1b9kyx9/a_wholesome_story_about_hakeem_olajuwon/

2024-03-31,1711892473,There is a CONCERTED EFFORT by Mainstream Sports Media to DESTROY the ALPI SENGUN/ JALEN GREEN CORE,"Its quite shocking to see such ubiquitous proliferation all over social media/internet of the new mainstream sports media narrative about the rockets and their winning streak:

""Can Sengun and Jalen Green work?""

""Has Sengun held Jalen Green back all this time?""

""Do the rockets have to choose one and trade the other?""

Dear Patrick, Tillman and the rest of the Fertitta family,

if you see this,

DONT FALL FOR IT.

They (nba ruling class) are scared. They realize the rockets are creating a monster core and they want it broken apart because the rockets are not following the script...

Script says this year rockets should only be ""developing"" this year and by god, adam silver and company have already written the script out this year: Steph vs Lebron in the play in. Why are the rockets trying to mess that up?

""WAIT YOUR TURN""

Its not just mainstream sports media, ITS HOUSTON MEDIA AND HOUSTON ROCKETS FANS falling for the bait and have started the narrative that sengun's been holding back green all this time and that eventually, they will have to trade one or the other in order for either to fulfill their true potential....

Its pure chaos programming meant to influence rockets ownership to disperse a lot of these talented players the rockets have started to accumulate. I see this all the time being implemented in non sports situations but ive seen an uptick with this in sports due to sports blogs, message board forums, all these locked on, sportsmap, sbnation sites/social media channels that cover all american sports team. Its not just politics that have these false narrative programming in order to ""instigate/influence action"" that the powers that be want.

This happens all the time in sports from trying to influence organizations on how drafts SHOULD GO (you must draft this guy because we have projected them this way, if you deviate, you are on the hook if the draft pick fails) to trying to influence a trade by inflating a guy's value through media (most shameless and blatant example i can remember was espn promoting KYLE LOWRY IS THE GREATEST TORONTO RAPTOR IN HISTORY when the raptors were trying to trade him) or punish someone for some perceived infraction (sterling mess, pick any draymond incident, any cases of perceived racism)....i can make an entire subreddit on this issue alone.

Its not even a conspiracy theory at this point...

Far too much evidence.

Do i need to reference r nba threads that show how blatant and shameless the nba refs have been in favoring the lakers just this year alone?

r nba has pretty much scientifically proven it especially that thread about how the lakers get so much free throws despite them being ranked so low in terms of driving to the hoop.

Let's not forget the in season tournament where the clippers and lakers were in danger of being knocked off quite early and of course, the rockets came to town trying ""change the script"" that silver and his cronies have written out....and what happened during those games this year? The clipper game were harden hit the game winner was particularly egregious, the absurd calls the rockets got shafted all over that game...Rockets kept having double digit leads only for it to be erased with the whistle...then it turned the other way, clippers started getting double digit leads only for the rockets to keep whittling it down to single possession ready to get the lead only for....the whistle to make sure the script stays true.

You see it with the winning streak alone. NBA trying their best to end the streak and ""help"" secure the lebron vs steph play in. What was the free throw totals just before halftime vs okc? it was like 12-1 or 13-0 or something?

Heck, go see the boxscores for nearly all laker games during this winning streak. Anybody catch that bucks lakers game? Double OT?

PLUS NO LEBRON?

Laker Free throws: 30-32

Bucks? 11-17

That's with dame, middleton AND GIANNIS PLAYING!!!!

[https://www.espn.com/nba/boxscore/\_/gameId/401585673](https://www.espn.com/nba/boxscore/_/gameId/401585673)

LOL.

Go see the boxscore and the lakers starting line up free throw attempts. talk about LOL.

and it hasnt stop.   i dont even want to think about what the refs are doing for the warriors because that will just trigger harden playoff era ptsd...

and this isnt just some trivial inconsequential fan gripe, CURRENT RICH AND FAMOUS ACTIVE NBA PLAYERS are sick and tired of the corruption. Do i need to bring up rudy goebert and ant edward's frustrations and the fines they have occured for daring to speak on the shameless disgusting actions of referees????

This isnt some deluded fan thing or some upset nba player millionaire complaining because he didnt like a call that lost them the game.  We have ACTIVE NBA coaches and front office guys CALLING OUT THE SHADY REFEREEING we are seeing just this season alone!!!!

BEWARE OF SUBVERSIVIE INFILITRATORS

This is happening more and more lately. POSTERS FROM OTHER ORGANIZATIONS coming in and trying to influence the fanbase and eventually the ownership of the team to certain narratives and forcing moves that cause chaos and damage to the team. This sengun green false narrative epitomizes it.

Forget about the fact that its been a small sample size, forget about the fact that the rockets havent really played and beaten a great team during this streak, forget about the fact that jalen and sengun are complete opposites positionally and style wise and that when you start playing better teams, the rockets talent shortage will come into play, forget the fact that the rockets are missing multiple integral pieces like cam whitmore and tari eason....

forget the fact that alip started out playing in a more organized and competitive league in europe and that jalen's development was held back due to AAU and ignite deficiencies and that it wasnt sengun holding jalen back but jalen himself (should we take back all the dad buff, draya did it, jalen himself said his new baby has been an important aspect of his third year leap, said on camera to vanessa richardson after the road win vs the wizards....

There is a concerted effort by mainstream sports media to break up the rockets core because they need talent dispersed to rest of the nba and they need to start feeding the coastal elite teams who are getting old. Mainstream sports media have always despised southern non coastal liberal/progressive states when they win. Especially if they dont have a mainstream nike star like lebron or jodran or kobe.

DONT FALL FOR IT FERTITTA FAMILY.

DONT FALL FOR IT RAFAEL STONE.

It almost happened with jalen green to nets for mikal. the sports blogs, and mainstream sports media almost made that happen....",rockets,80,https://www.reddit.com/r/rockets/comments/1bsaoie/there_is_a_concerted_effort_by_mainstream_sports/

2024-05-21,1716311116,"[Iko] A handful of teams have expressed interest in acquiring the third overall pick, team and league sources told The Athletic. Houston is interested in trading for Clevelands Donovan Mitchell. Per team sources, the Rockets will re-engage with the Nets leading up to the June 26 draft.","Source: https://www.nytimes.com/athletic/5507812/2024/05/21/rockets-nba-draft-no-3-pick-donovan-mitchell/?source=user_shared_article

&gt; The casual nature of the combine  conversations with league executives, agents, media and scouts held either in the lobby and restaurant area of the Marriott Marquis or on the concourse of the adjacent Wintrust Arena  gave an early peek into outside interest in the Rockets No. 3 pick. Talks have largely been informal, the bulk of concrete offers likely wont come in until draft night, but a handful of teams have expressed interest in acquiring the pick, team and league sources told The Athletic. Interested teams would either like to move up to No. 3 or ones that would like to move into the first round altogether, sources said.

&gt; Team sources said Houston will listen to offers. For example, moving back and collecting additional assets should not be ruled out as a possibility, not this early in the process. Since 29 other teams may have 29 opinions on the top of the draft, big boards could vary. Last season, the Rockets expected Cam Whitmore (who had been highly graded) to be gone by the time their 20th pick came around. They were prepared to trade out of the draft entirely  and were surprised he was still on the board when the pick arrived. A similar situation could arise next month, with a player they like at No. 3 potentially available at say, No. 9.

&gt; Another possibility, if the Rockets were to move the No. 3 pick, is packaging it with additional assets for a star. Houston is flush with young talent and draft capital that could appeal to teams with elite talent in flux. One player who fits is Clevelands Donovan Mitchell. The Rockets are among those interested in the 27-year-old and have been monitoring his situation for months, league sources say. The Cavaliers guards delay in inking a long-term extension, coupled with another disheartening playoff exit, only adds to speculation about his future. Such a move for an All-NBA type player would be more suitable than for others who could potentially be available  New Orleans Brandon Ingram and Brooklyns Mikal Bridges  for example.

&gt; Houston also could look to acquire future draft picks, such as Brooklyns array of assets courtesy of the Phoenix Suns/Kevin Durant trade. The Houston Chronicle first reported the Rockets interest in the Suns unprotected first-round picks (Brooklyn has ownership of 2025, 27 and 29 Phoenix firsts in addition to swaps beginning in 2028). Per team sources, the Rockets will re-engage with the Nets leading up to the June 26 draft.",rockets,176,https://www.reddit.com/r/rockets/comments/1cxcxr6/iko_a_handful_of_teams_have_expressed_interest_in/

2024-01-09,1704818105,The indecisive flamingo has arrived: Alperen ^engün's substance has caught up to his style [too-long OC Analysis],"\[Hi, all! Originally wrote this for r/nba and r/nbadiscussion but was told to post this here, too, so forgive some of the obvious no-duh stuff for Rockets fans here. Hopefully you enjoy!\]  

Alperen ^engün has been a fascination of mine since his very first game, when he tried an outrageous over-the-head alley-oop off a rebound from a missed free throw. That was as a 19-year-old rookie in his first NBA game! Most of his peers were just trying not to land on Shaqtin a Fool. What would he do as his skills caught up to his ambition?

Were seeing it this season. ^engün is mounting a credible (probable?) All-Star campaign as the propulsion system of the Houston Rockets, and thankfully, hes lost none of his flash along the way.

^engün is full of weird quirks, both good and bad, making him a delightful watch. A few weeks ago, ^engün committed a foul while *lining up for a jump ball*. He has some of the happiest feet in the league, impressionistically blurring the lines between pivots and travels until Im unsure whether Im looking at art or a practical joke. He loves a Dirkian one-legged fadeaway, but hell even pump fake with his leg, a move Ive dubbed the indecisive flamingo: \[[video here](https://www.basketballpoetry.com/p/the-indecisive-flamingo-has-arrived)\]

This season, the good far outweighs the bad. ^engüns substance has caught up to his style to create one of the leagues most eminently watchable  and effective players.

\[Hi, all! Thanks for reading. As always, I've compiled a whole bunch of film clips and GIFs -- nearly a dozen this time! -- [that you can view here](https://www.basketballpoetry.com/p/the-indecisive-flamingo-has-arrived). I think they add a lot to the post, particularly for a player who does as much cool stuff as Sengun, so check that out!\]

^engüns passing is his best skill, and this has been by far the best passing season of his career. There have been way fewer insane flings into the third row or bowling-ball bounce passes that weakly roll past teammates ankles. Instead, hes cut out the lowest-probability attempts and focused on execution: more whips into shooting pockets, a better sense of timing for cutters, and ball movement designed to stretch the defense, not to hunt highlights.

That doesnt mean hes lost his flair. Hes a master of the eye-bulging, head-snapping lookaway: \[[video here](https://www.basketballpoetry.com/p/the-indecisive-flamingo-has-arrived)\]

He reads the floor exceptionally well, letting him make adjustments in real-time. This absurd jump-catch-pass has lived in a rent-controlled apartment in my head all season: \[[video here](https://www.basketballpoetry.com/p/the-indecisive-flamingo-has-arrived)\]

But ^engün isnt just a sweet passer. He has some schoolyard bully in him. Put somebody even slightly smaller in his way, and hell shoulder-check that player into a cameramans lap (even if its LeBron James): \[[video here](https://www.basketballpoetry.com/p/the-indecisive-flamingo-has-arrived)\]

^engün isnt a quick jumper, which limits his explosion at the rack and creates problems against tall, lanky shot blockers (hes a [below-average finisher at the rim](https://cleaningtheglass.com/stats/player/4879#tab-shooting_accuracy)). He makes up for that lack of vertical burst with a delicate touch and a strong short-midrange game (thanks to his signature shot-put floater), big reasons why ^engün and his new point guard Fred VanVleet have been [the leagues most prolific assist pairing](https://www.basketballpoetry.com/p/the-nbas-top-assist-duo-for-2023). And make no mistake: when hes given a runway, hell catch a body. ^engüns an underrated in-game dunker: \[[video here](https://www.basketballpoetry.com/p/the-indecisive-flamingo-has-arrived)\]

On the other hand, ^engüns rebounding might be a tad overrated at this point. Hes a perfectly fine glass cleaner, sporting [average offensive and defensive rebounding rates](https://cleaningtheglass.com/stats/player/4879#tab-defense_rebounding) (he was better last year) and garnering nine boards per game. He might even be better than that, given that[ the team overall rebounds well ](https://cleaningtheglass.com/stats/player/4879/lineups#tab-four_factors)when ^engün is on the floor. But he should be elite, and I see opportunities for improvement. Too often, he contests a shot and stands there, hand in the air, waiting to see what happens. Here, that results in his common comparison, Nikola Joki, powering past him to give Denver another chance: \[[video here](https://www.basketballpoetry.com/p/the-indecisive-flamingo-has-arrived)\]

Contrast this to Jokis behavior in the same situation. As soon as the shot goes up, he immediately puts a forearm into ^engün to box him out before gravitating to the ball: \[[video here](https://www.basketballpoetry.com/p/the-indecisive-flamingo-has-arrived)\]

^engün generally has a high level of effort and doesnt make this mistake too often, but the difference between very good and great is doing the right thing *every time*. ^engün isnt there yet  neither was the Joker, at this point  and thats okay. This is a natural growth area for young players.

^engüns already grown his pick-and-roll defense to an exciting degree. While hes still vulnerable on perimeter switches (hes quicker going forward and backward than side-to-side), hes gotten significantly savvier at the cat-and-mouse drop coverage. Hell lunge at ballhandlers to make them pick up dribbles early before leaping backward to protect against the alley-oop, and he recognizes when a ballhandler is looking for the pass from the get-go. Here, ^engün knows that Duncan Robinson doesnt have the angle for a layup and is looking for the lob to Bam Adebayo, so he gets up and bats away the pass to the athletic Miami big: \[[video here](https://www.basketballpoetry.com/p/the-indecisive-flamingo-has-arrived)\]

^engün averages 2.5 deflections per game, the same number as Herb Jones, Derrick White, and Giannis Antetokounmpo, but he has allowed opponents to shoot 60.9% at the rim, a shrug-worthy number thats virtually the same as Joki. He doesnt have the sort of quick-twitch leaping ability that the most menacing paint patrollers have, which will always limit his rim protection metrics to some degree. ^engün has quick hands and is better at contesting balls before they get in the air, but just like with his dunks, ^engün has enough athleticism to still make plays on the ball if hes given time to lurch into motion. Look at this chase-down block on Kyrie Irving (one of several hes had on the year): \[[video here](https://www.basketballpoetry.com/p/the-indecisive-flamingo-has-arrived)\]

Dont forget that the Rockets heavily pursued Brook Lopez in the offseason, and it wasnt likely to play alongside ^engün; this is a team (and a coach) that expected him to be a sieve on the defensive end. They wanted an upgrade. Instead, ^engün showed up in noticeably better shape  leaner, quicker, stronger  and has since played the second-most minutes on the team. (Its no accident that ^engüns [been a monster](https://www.statmuse.com/nba/ask/alperen-sengun-on-0-days-rest) on the second night of back-to-backs, as the Houston broadcast pointed out recently.)

Advanced all-in-one defensive metrics agree hes been [better than average](https://dunksandthrees.com/player/1630578) (to a [wildly overstated degree](https://www.basketball-reference.com/leagues/NBA_2024_advanced.html), in some cases), and lineups with ^engün have been [in the 80th percentile defensively](https://cleaningtheglass.com/stats/player/4879/lineups#tab-four_factors) (thanks partially  though not entirely  to poor opponent three-point shooting). And at just 21 years old, ^engün is still improving as an athlete and defender.

Not all of ^engüns future improvement lies on him, however. Youll notice that many of the offensive clips Ive used come from a traditional pick-and-roll or getting ^engün the ball on the block. For ^engün to take the next step, hell need the offense to work not just through him, but *for* him. The best centers in the world are Nikola Joki and Joel Embiid, but despite the ostensible constraints of their position, they often get the ball and initiate action in creative, unconventional ways.

What has unlocked Joki and Embiid even further in the past two seasons? Off-ball movement. Both players have excelled when getting the rock on the go. I dont have access to Second Spectrum data (if you do and can help, please let me know!), but it feels as though so many of ^engüns possessions have him catching the ball while stationary at the elbow, posted up on the block, or rolling in a traditional two-man game with VanVleet. ^engün has been effective, but Id love to see more creativity. Coach Ime Udoka should follow suit with his peers in Denver and Philadelphia and treat ^engün like a playmaking wing, not just a traditional center.

To Udokas credit, thats starting to happen more as he, VanVleet, and ^engün grow together. There have been occasional VanVleet ball screens for ^engün ; put on your readers, and you see shades of Jamal Murray and Joki: \[[video here](https://www.basketballpoetry.com/p/the-indecisive-flamingo-has-arrived)\]

Last week, the Rockets ran a VanVleet DHO to ^engün at the top of the three-point arc that was ripped straight from Philadelphias playbook for Tyrese Maxey and Embiid: \[[video here](https://www.basketballpoetry.com/p/the-indecisive-flamingo-has-arrived)\]

Those are good actions! ^engün is a solid and improving roll man who excels in traditional center settings, but weve seen other players surpass their supposed ceilings when used inventively. Creativity is certainly not ^engüns problem, and I dont think its Udokas, either. Mark my words: well see much more of this stuff by next season at the latest (but hopefully sooner than that).

Flamingos gain their famous pink hue thanks to pigments in their preferred snacks, shrimp and algae; they are what they eat. For ^engün to look his best, hell need to be fed a varied diet of play calls designed around his best skills on both ends. With an effective point guard, an exciting new coach, and a bevy of young, versatile talent, Houston is well-positioned to cook up just that.",rockets,24,https://www.reddit.com/r/rockets/comments/192iuct/the_indecisive_flamingo_has_arrived_alperen/

2023-11-15,1700037258,Alperen ^engün Appreciation Post,"I'm from Band1rma, Turkey. Most of you probably don't know where it is. However, I was fortunate enough to watch Alperen ^engün when he was a teenager. He was a part of the youth academy of Banvit, which was one of the most formidable academies at the time. The U16 team completely dominated the league, and Alperen emerged as the leader of that team. They lost just one game throughout the entire season and convincingly won the final match against Anadolu Efes, securing the championship title. Even at that time, Alperen showcased his skills as a prominent big man and was named MVP. It's worth mentioning that many players from that team have now become significant figures in the local league as well.

In the following season, Alperen and several others transitioned to regular players on the main roster, with Alperen often being part of the starting five at the age of 17. However, the outbreak of the pandemic disrupted the league, preventing its completion. Unfortunately, Banvit, once a competitive club in both the local league and European tournaments, had to cease operations due to financial difficulties. During his brief tenure in the Banvit main roster, Alperen already displayed his promising abilities as a big man.

Seeing him perform as an NBA star brings me immense joy because the entire audience in Band1rma anticipated this outcome.",rockets,20,https://www.reddit.com/r/rockets/comments/17vp9my/alperen__engün_appreciation_post/

2024-04-20,1713578143,Jalen Green is such a lamb chop! ,"You are probably wondering about what the hell I am talking about. Ok, let me give you the context. I am from Turkey, and as you might have already guessed, I am a big fan of ""our boy"" (why is he ""our boy""? he is ""your boy"" as well! Wait, that totally makes him truly ""our boy!""), Alp-i. So, I have been following the Rockets for three straight years in a row now. And I now feel like I am of one yours. What breaks my heart is how there emerges a discourse about how these two, that Jalen and Alp-i cannot make it together. As far as I can understand, most Turkish NBA followers have developed a strong sense, mostly due to the very provocative US media that constantly shouts out how these two cannot stay together-- that how Alp-i's game style is hindering Jalen's capacity; or how much better Alp-i could flourish without the presence of Jalen( for instance his assist scores). Most Turkish fans I know of think Alp-i should find a new home to play, to succeed, because they are sucked in this narrative, that Jalen the 2nd overall pick would never be sacrificed by the Rockets front office. I strongly disagree with both delusions. I think they perfectly complement each other. They will flourish together! Both are very special players. I will not discuss what Alp-i is capable of doing (he has already shown that), and Jalen has also time and again proven why he has been the 2nd overall pick, already. My Jalen boy, lamb chop, so dear to my heart as well! 

Lamb chop is a very bad translation of a Turkish endearing word, ""kuzum"", which should perhaps have been translated as, ""my lamb"". Such a great talent, in Jalen, you have found! Keep him. Keep ""our boy"" Alp-i as well. That's it!

2024-05-15,1715815630,"10 most talked-about prospects: Why each is a Rocket, and why each is NOT a Rocket","Ive never been more confused about who I want to draft. Its changing on a daily basis almost, and sometimes more than once per day. Theres no clear tiers beyond Sarr, and theres no perfect prospect.

Considering there are so many possibilities with this pick, including trading it, I wanted to organize my thoughts, then I figured Id share it with you all.

These are the top 10 most considered prospects as far as I can tell from the chatter on Reddit and Twitter. These are in NO PARTICULAR ORDER.

**Reed Sheppard** (Combo Guard)

*- Why hes a Rocket*  
He's the ""Advanced Stats Darling"" of the draft class, and addresses what is currently Houston's biggest need (shooting). Nice hands on defense. Showed out at the combine with ""sneaky athleticism"". Smart player and good passer.

*- Why hes NOT a Rocket*  
He's undersized, at 6'2"" with a 6'3"" wingspan, weighing-in at 182 lbs. Despite being a bit of a menace in passing lanes, he gets blown by on-ball &amp; will be targeted by opposing offenses. He only took 4.4 3PA per game in college, which is quite low for a 58% shooter. Will he be able to get his shot off in the league?

**Stephon Castle** (Guard/Wing Hybrid)

*- Why hes a Rocket*  
Castle is a winning player with outstanding size &amp; length for his position, boasting a 6'9"" wingspan. He's the best POA defender in the class. Ime loves switchable players.

*- Why hes NOT a Rocket*  
Wasn't much of a shooter in college, despite having excelled in the 3pt shooting drills at the combine. Unless we're confident he can develop a respectable shot, how do you add another non-shooter to this team?

**Nikola Topic** (Lead Guard)

*- Why hes a Rocket*  
For one, his name is Nikola& Other than that, he's a 6'6"" legitimate PG who has contributed to winning in Serbia at only 18 years old. He's a great finisher at the rim with elite body control and a talented playmaker who excels in the P&amp;R.

*- Why hes NOT a Rocket*  
He's not a shooter, and it's not certain what he could offer in an off-ball role. Houston would have to be committed to his role as a lead ball handler enough to relegate Amen to the wing, and it seems too early to give up on him developing a viable handle. Topic also has a knee injury history and is currently injured, so he may be difficult to evaluate.

**Rob Dillingham** (Lead Guard)

*- Why hes a Rocket*  
He's twitchy and athletic with great handles, is probably the best playmaker in the class, and his footwork is otherworldly. Good finisher at the rim, even finishing through contact despite his size. Very good shooter with a lightning-fast release.

*- Why hes NOT a Rocket*  
If Reed is undersized, so is Rob but arguably even more. Defense is questionable at best. Can be a bit erratic and has a tendency of overdribbling. Does his skillset overlap too much with Jalen Green? How many athletic guards does a team actually need?

**Alex Sarr** (Center)

*- Why hes a Rocket*  
Size, length, mobility, rim protection, shooting upside - what more could you want from a prospect? He could play behind or beside Sengun. Great fit and probably the best prospect in the draft period.

*- Why hes NOT a Rocket*  
He probably won't be available at 3, and it may not be worth trading assets to move up for yet another raw young player, despite the fit &amp; ceiling.

**Donovan Clingan** (Center)

*- Why hes a Rocket*  
A two-time NCAA champion, Clingan is a beast of a human standing 7'2"" and 282 lbs with a 7'7"" wingspan and a standing reach of 9'7"". Maybe the best interior defender to come out of college in years, he could be the perfect yin to Sengun's yang, coming off the bench to take away the paint from opposing offenses.

*- Why hes NOT a Rocket*  
Using a #3 pick to draft a backup to the team's best player could be considered a misuse of the asset. Houston is already fairly deep at center, with Steven Adams, Jock Landale, and both Jabari and Jeff for small-ball lineups. Clingan is also an ""old school"" center, and the league is moving to more athletic and mobile centers.

**Kel'el Ware** (Center)

*- Why hes a Rocket*  
Measuring-in very similarly to Sarr, Ware is a lengthy lob threat who can defend the paint. He also shot 43% from beyond the arc, albeit on low volume. He's also not too shabby as a passer. Could be an incredible value in the 15-20 range in a trade-down scenario.

*- Why hes NOT a Rocket*  
While he may have more tools than Clingan to be used in more ways, he's not nearly as dominant at defending the paint. There are questions about his motor &amp; some compare him to Christian Wood. Taking Ware would also require finding the right trade partner - will the asset gained from trading down be worth it?

**Zaccharie Risacher** (Wing)

*- Why hes a Rocket*  
Risacher is a lengthy 3&amp;D wing who can finish and shoot (40% from 3). You can never have too many of those kind of guys in the modern NBA (so they say). Having another floor spacer could be helpful, especially one with a pro comp like MPJ. He plays in a Euro league, so he's faced tougher competition than any of the guys in college have.

*- Why hes NOT a Rocket*  
With Dillon, Jabari, Tari, Amen, and Cam already on the roster, how do you find minutes to give this guy? His FT% is barely 70%, so is the shot real? Euro leagues dont play many games, so there's a small sample size. He also may not be available, as many mocks have him going 1st or 2nd overall.

**Matas Buzelis** (Wing)

*- Why hes a Rocket*  
With good handles &amp; nice footwork for his size, he can create his own shot. Matas has one of the highest upsides of the class and pro comps like Franz Wagner are enticing. He's also a good shot blocker as a help defender, which could pair well with Sengun. If he bulks up he could probably play 2-4.

*- Why hes NOT a Rocket*  
Matas is coming from the G-League Ignite, which doesn't exist anymore mostly because it was deemed a terribly broken development program. He shot very poorly throughout the season and plays with an aversion to contact.

**Dalton Knecht** (Wing)

*- Why hes a Rocket*  
Quite possibly the best movement shooter in the class, Knecht can also score from all three levels. He's an NBA-ready 6'5"" with 6'9"" wingspan who shot 40% from 3 in college as the focal point of an SEC offense. With other scorers around him, his 3P% could get even better in the league. A late bloomer, Knecht's journey started in JUCO before going to a mid-major and then dominating the SEC his senior year.

*- Why hes NOT a Rocket*  
He's 23 years old. His defense is sus, which seems to be mostly a matter of effort considering he aced the lateral movement drill at the combine. Is it reaching to draft him at 3? Would it be worth it to try to trade down a few spots, or not worth the risk? If he projects to be a role player for Houston, couldn't they simply find a floor spacer in free agency?",rockets,88,https://www.reddit.com/r/rockets/comments/1csyyx0/10_most_talkedabout_prospects_why_each_is_a/
2024-05-12,1715545529,LET HIM COOK,,rockets,5,https://www.reddit.com/r/rockets/comments/1cqh44w/let_him_cook/
2024-04-01,1712008865,We're so ridiculously loaded with young talent we forget Jabari is a great prospect,"Jabari is largely forgotten / under-discussed by this subreddit and the media generally. 

He's objectively a very good 2nd year player and for the most part has lived up to expectations for a 3rd overall pick to this point

He's averaging 14ppg / 8 rpg (37% 3pt, 56% TS) while being asked to do a lot defensively. These are really good numbers for a 20 yr old on a winning team lol 

JS has a ton of upside on both sides of the ball and I fully expect him to be a 20/10\~ guys for the latter part of the 2020s. 

Realistically he's a top 10 prospect out of the last 2 draft classes, yet we dont always include him when we talk about our 'untouchables'. 

Right now the only players from the 2022 and 2023 draft classes you could claim are ahead of Bari are:

\- Paolo Banchero

\- Chet Holmgren

\- Jalen Williams (Jabari prob has more upside..might stick w Bari tbh)

\- Bennedict Matthurin (I would take Bari)

\- Jalen Duren (maybe prob not)

\- Wemby

\- Brandon Miller (unclear, would prob take Bari)

\- Jaime Jaiquez (maybe)

\- Amen Thompson (love)

\- Keyonte George (doubtful) 

&amp;#x200B;

2024-03-31,1711896709,"Cautionary tale from a former Cavs fan, do not trade away our young core. The Donovan Mitchell DISASTER.","I used to follow the Cavs avidly, they were my favourite team along with the Rockets. In the 2021 season, they had a brilliant young core of Darius Garland, Collin Sexton, Isaac Okoro, Evan Mobley, Jarrett Allen and Lauri Markannen.

The current Rockets young core is even better than their former young core in my opinion but I might be biased.

Anyway, the Cavs were a fun team, they fought their butts off but fell off after the all star break that season. They had 2 play in games and the refs stole the 2nd one when they played the hawks. That was the last time they played together, note, Collin didn't even get a chance to play due to an injury, I really wanted to see him back and have their whole team playing.

The off season, they traded away Lauri, Collin + the recent 1st round draft pick Ochai + 5 more picks/swaps for Donovan Mitchell. I was one of the biggest voices against that trade at the time despite the overwhelming support for the trade.

I hated it because the Cavs had a bright future and all the players enjoyed playing there and wanted to be there to make Cleveland special. However, the front office had the bright idea to trade for a disgruntled mid tier star so they can ""win-now"". I predicted during the trade the Cavs will be a perpetual 1st round exit team when the trade happend and I am willing to make a large bet that Cleveland isn't making it past the 1st round again this year. Their team is also just not fun to watch anymore, I don't care about the development of their players anyway. Plus, Mitchell is definitely gone by the end of his contract, even if he isn't, his contract will eat up too much cap space for any useful signings, Cavs will be back as 1st round exits every year if they even make the play offs.  


The Rockets look like they might repeat what the Cavs did in the 2022 off season. I really hope the front office puts faith in player development and investing in guys who actually give a F about this franchise and wanting to turn a bottom team to a top tier through their own efforts. WE DO NOT NEED OUTSIDE SUPERSTARS. We already got our guys, lets see what they can do.

Of couse, I'm not blindly loyal to our guys either but they are all under 23, give them at least 4-5 years to show us something instead of trading them away for.....Donovan Mitchell. Cause we all know he's getting traded by the Cavs this off season LMAO. I hope he doesn't fool our front office, some other team can take him.",rockets,83,https://www.reddit.com/r/rockets/comments/1bsc7cd/cautionary_tale_from_a_former_cavs_fan_do_not/

Here's the trade, [put much more concisely by Shams](https://x.com/ShamsCharania/status/1805786075073270074). 

#Nets receive:
* Nets' 2025 FRP (Houston held swap rights)
* Nets' 2026 FRP (Houston held pick outright)

#Houston receives: 
* Suns' 2025 FRP (We own swap rights, no protections)
* Suns' 2027 FRP (We own the pick outright, no protections)
* Suns' or Dallas' 2029 FRP (We have outright ownership of the best of either pick)
* Suns' or Dallas' 2029 FRP (We have swap rights to the worst of either pick)

2024-01-11,1704978786,"We are 18-18, we should really be happy with this season","Not even because of our record, idc much about it. But our team is gonna be SO good in a year or 2. Our young talent is REALLY young. Jabari is 20, Amen is 20, Sengun is 21, Jalen is 21, and Cam is 19. 

You got a 19 year old (Cam) easily scoring and shooting 44% from 3 AND defending against nba vets. Think about where his game will be 3 years from now.

People say jalen hasnt improved and thats nonsense. Hes never been this good of a passer and screen navigator. His defense and effort is much higher than last year. Shot selection (despite still missing) is much better. And he is much more selfless. Im not giving up on a man who is still working on not being THE GUY. 

Bari put up 18 and 15 last night on good 3% shooting. IMAGINE HIM WITH 20 MORE POUNDS OF MUSCLE. Dude will be a unit with a high post game and a pull up 3. much better post defense and post game due to size. Easily a 20/10 guy down the road. 

Amen cant shoot for a lick but he boards, pushes tempo, defends, plays smart, and can finish as well. Hes everything we need from a future pg.

Sengun is him, dont need to say more.

But these close games and competing for playoffs will consistently improve our young core and expose them to a winning culture. Seeing sengun turn it around like that is showing him you are the face of this franchise rn, get your shit together

2024 man. I'm almost 40. Those championships years are a core memory and I just want to share one with my son. Let it breathe my friends.

And hes doing this despite a shooting slump from 3 (Only 32% from there on 7 attempts in this span) The reason hes been so efficient is the damage hes done from 2.

He played like an Allstar and hes going into year 4. Hes his own player. And no one else in the league is named baby anything/anyone. 

No disrespect to Jokic whatsoever but to me, this is a similar level of disrespect as when that one reporter asked Kyrie if Lebron was like a father figure to him. 

His game is similar to Jokic in many ways but after 3 seasons of play I think its clear they also have several differences. A players nickname shouldnt ever be baby (similar player). Im actually dumbfounded by how so many in this fanbase have never considered that maybe he doesnt like that name.

Better shooting, *much* better ball handling, and still learning to play defense in the system. When he was matched up against THJ, it seemed to always be an easy bucket and he even got off the last 3 at the end of the game.

2024-07-15,1721022442,Blazer fan since '75 is pumped for what the Rockets are doing,"In 2021, when Houston took Green and Sengun in the draft, I took notice, really liking those moves.

In 2022, they added Jabari Smith (who was #1 on my board) and Tari Eason, and I absolutely loved it.

In 2023, they took Amen Thompson (who I wanted for Portland) and Cam Whitmore at pick #20!...and I just really started to become a fan of this team. They also added Ima Udoka, who I've been high on since he played for Portland, and into his coaching days.

So when the 2024 draft rolled around, I was as excited for your pick as I was for the Blazers. I kept hoping they'd pick Sheppard if he was still on the board, which I think is the perfect landing spot...and they did. So, at some point yesterday I decided, that's it, I'm going to adopt the Rockets as my other team. It's like watching a team that picked nearly all the players I wanted, and then went and got one of my favorite coaches, and I just really love what they're doing, and cannot wait to see all these guys play together this season.

So, just know that there's a Blazer fan out there in the shadows, who also loves the Rockets, and will be cheering you guys on!",rockets,15,https://www.reddit.com/r/rockets/comments/1e3n992/blazer_fan_since_75_is_pumped_for_what_the/

They said we aint real because we blew out the Lakers with no AD, even though AD has statistically been a net negative for the team so far and the game was never competitive.

They said we aint real because the Pelicans had no CJ and their bench was injured, even though BI was hitting plenty of contested shots, Zion was solid, and they had a rookie dropping 4 3s in a row.

Now theyll say we aint real because we beat the Nuggets with no Jamaal and their bench sucked. They aint talking about how good the Nuggets looked without Jamaal. They aint talking about how good our defense and bench is to lock down the supporting cast.

People are still gonna say that we aint real. Because its been a small sample size. Because we will regress to the mean. Because were only winning on home court and wont do anything on the road.

Being 1 of only 6 players to potentially start all 82 regular season games this season (assuming he starts tomorrow)!

And going through a slump where teams could leave him unguarded ... to playing so well that he demanded double teams to get the ball out of his hands.

Lots of improvements but weirdly may likely still be traded this summer.

If that happens, I just want to thank him (and the team and coaches AND DRAYA) for giving me 11 games of awesomeness that made our three years of rebuilding finally feel worth it!

If he and Sengun figure it out we can be dangerous, and even if he gets traded he will attract a good return (perhaps Mikal Bridges or a badass shooter) that will make us better.

2024-09-23,1727077144,This team is gonna be so much fun to watch,"Feels like we have infinite options for lineups to match up with any team. Were stacked with young electrifying quality talent. Last years core 6 should all see some improvement &amp; some could see huge leaps after a full calendar year with a real head coach &amp; veteran leadership. Plus were adding a ROY betting favorite selected 3rd overall, Adams and his immaculate vibes &amp; off the charts impact, especially alongside speedy guards, &amp; Tari Eason who was still incredible even with leg tumors last year will now be fully healthy.

Our depth and the variation of tools and weapons that Udoka has at his disposal is unlike any roster construction Ive ever seen assembled in the NBA. How many teams have had this many good-great players? 

I dont think well be immune to injuries this season but well certainly be less susceptible to them when minutes are allocated in a fairly even spread compared to most teams who will be top heavy and will desperately rely on their top players. 

Rockets will certainly be underrated by most fans because they dont think we have a top 5 player on the roster. But their definition of top 5 player is generally best guy on a top 5 team. Ant for example, could average the same 
 stats on a 35 win team and 0 fans would have him top 20 imo. If our team starts racking up the wins, our guys will get the recognition they deserve.",rockets,23,https://www.reddit.com/r/rockets/comments/1fnezh2/this_team_is_gonna_be_so_much_fun_to_watch/

Tobias Harris would be super hard on himself whenever the fans would kill him on Reddit and twitter.

Why propagate narratives among 21 year olds that they likely will see and possibly drive a wedge between them?  

It adds nothing, most of the time, the team just gets worse. Now the Sixers never will win anything because Embiid/Simmons stupid feud years ago. 


For the record I had Sengun number 1 in his class and Jalen Green number 2, I am super big on both guys since they were rookies and followed the team extensively since then. If JG shooting and finishing remains this good next year this team will win a ton of games with both players, unlikely to win as much with only 1.

2024-04-13,1713047382,Ill never understand yall Rockets fans who hate Harden,"After all he did for the franchise, averaging 30 8 and 6 across 9 seasons with 600+ games played, theres still people who hate on him just because he couldnt win us a championship. If the Warriors wouldnt have had the best team oat for 3 seasons straight, we couldve won multiple titles. And all this talk about Harden always dissappearing in the playoffs is just because he was so insanely good during regular season. His performance obviously dipped a little bit in the playoffs but he still averaged 28,4 7 and 6 for us in the playoffs, thats still really good. At the end of the day, he won an MVP playing for us and had one of the best offensive seasons ever in the history of the league. Maybe his departure was a little controversial but when I see Rockets fans hating on Harden I get the same vibes as when Spurs fans boo on Kawhi.

Forget all the good things that have ever happened, how we've built to where we are now through smart business decisions, drafting, veteran pickups, coaching, and organic internal development. 

I had us making the playoffs this year but after we lost one basketball game I am now firmly convinced that this franchise will cease to exist in several months and everyone in the greater Houston area will suffer a horrible and lasting famine.",rockets,111,https://www.reddit.com/r/rockets/comments/1gb36a6/guys_i_hate_to_say_it_but_its_fucking_over/

I live in Hawaii, and when I stream a Rockets away game, I dont always get to tune into Space City Network, which sucks because Craig and Ryan are commenting gems.
