At this stage in his career, he should not be playing any more than 30mpg. This is on Kerr for enabling him, despite his limitations.

And now everyone will shoot threes. Like when we changed the game shooting more threes like 10 years ago. Doing it again. We will shoot 70 threes a game. During timeouts the assistant coachs will shoot threes. 

We will always be back on defense bc we are all behind the line already. Occupying the unused logo liminal space. Logo pick and pops. We will have a free safety player. A guy who never makes it past the logo. Midfield.

2023-11-12,1699775874,That Draymond ejection was an actual mistake by the refs and wasn't allowed under NBA rules,"The whole thing about whether they can look to the previous play, or whether Mitchell should have gotten a tech too, is actually irrelevant to why the ejection was improper, because **refs can't call a technical foul on live ball contact.**



&gt; Section VConduct

&gt; An official may assess a technical foul, without prior warning, at any time.  A technical foul(s) may be assessed to any player on the court or anyone seated on the bench for conduct which, in the opinion of an official, is detrimental to the game. The technical foul must be charged to an individual. **A technical foul cannot be assessed for physical contact when the ball is alive.**


&gt; EXCEPTION: Fighting fouls and/or taunting with physical contact.

https://official.nba.com/rule-no-12-fouls-and-penalties/


 Draymond's foul (had it been called properly) would have been a personal (common or flagrant 1/2), not a technical. Which means unless it was a flagrant 2, he shouldn't have been ejected.

It's straight up against the rules to give a tech for pushing Mitchell during the play. The refs actually fucked this one up because they don't know the rules. I hope the league addresses this in some way.",warriors,68,https://www.reddit.com/r/warriors/comments/17tfjtp/that_draymond_ejection_was_an_actual_mistake_by/

2024-01-18,1705558932,Steph Curry and Draymond Green's Locker Room Exchange After Grizzlies Loss Revealed,"The Golden State Warriors suffered a terrible loss to a Memphis Grizzlies team missing almost all of their top players. After the game, Steph Curry and Draymond Green reportedly had an exchange on the locker room about how bad the team has been defensively.

During an episode of the Warriors Plus Minus Podcast , The Athletic's Anthony Slater said, ""And then in the locker room postgame, [Draymond Green] and Steph [Curry] were over there like, relatively loudly discussing how bad they've been defensively. Going through the numbers and talking about how bad they were when they were out and like they're bottom-five, and discussing, 'Oh wait, which teams are we better than? Like the Pistons, who else?' And this is something that the locker room can hear them discussing.""

Understandably frustrated with their team's defensive effort, Curry and Green made that known with this locker room discussion, per Slater. The defense is one of many issues the Warriors have right now, and it's arguably the biggest of them all. A great defensive team throughout their dynasty, the Warriors are currently 25th in the league this season in defensive rating. For reference, they were 2nd in 2022, the year they won the title.

An elite defense is almost always a requirement for every championship team, and the Warriors are far from that standard right now, which Green and Curry recognize.",warriors,171,https://www.reddit.com/r/warriors/comments/199jjgv/steph_curry_and_draymond_greens_locker_room/

2023-11-09,1699512107,[Joe Viray] Warriors bench outscored their Nuggets counterparts by a whopping 30 points (42-12). The team was a +7 in the 13.5 minutes Steph Curry was on the bench.,"Ill add to this what might be the craziest part about the final score of this game, that the Nuggets may or may not actually have deserved to win (objectively speaking, with the goaltend its a tie score so we really dont know how it would have ended if it had rightfully, at minimum, gone to OT), the # of minutes played by each teams starters:   

**Warriors:**    
Steph - 34   
Looney - 29   
Klay - 32   
Wiggs - 28   
Dario - 26   
Avg mins played by starters: 29.8 min       

**Nuggets:**   
Jokic - 36   
Gordon - 34   
MPJ - 36   
Reggie Jackson - 32   
KCP - 35   
Avg mins played by starters: 34.6 min      

The Nuggets had to play their starters nearly 5 mins more than our starters to scrape by with a win they may have not even deserved. Yes, they didnt have Jamal but we also didnt have Dray or GPII. Steph also only scored 23 pts and shot 35% lol and it was *still* that close. And again, this on top of our guys playing on the road, exhausted at the very end of 9 games in 9 different cities in 15 days with the Nuggets playing at home, which was also their 6th home game of the season.",warriors,56,https://www.reddit.com/r/warriors/comments/17r71pq/joe_viray_warriors_bench_outscored_their_nuggets/

But just speaking from a pure realistic standpoint, this team ain't going far. I know some of yall realize that but I know some will still have hope. I want to but everytime I think we're finding our footing, I quickly get reminded that we're not. This roster just simply isn't it. We lose games that on paper seem like they would be harder for us to lose than it would be to win. We might make the first round. The chances of that happening feel like it's getting lower with every game that passes. But thats most likely as far as it gets. Remind you our roster is fully healthy and we're still performing the same as we've been performing all year. It's just getting sad at this point.

2023-11-15,1700071195,We Should Be Able to Agree...,"Yes, Gobert does have Klay by the neck for maybe a second but it didn't look intentional. More like he was just tryna grab him and happens to be way taller than Klay. 

Draymond's chokehold clearly had venom behind it. I think any rational observer can understand that MULTIPLE things are true at once:

1. Klay did grab Jaden McDaniel's jersey, but it didn't seem malicious and Klay clearly lets go once he starts running to the other end. McDaniel's then clearly takes exception and then yanks Klay. By the letter of the law, Klay ""started"" it, but it's clear that McDaniels escalates it. McDaniels and Klay both should've been T'd up and that's it. MAYBE McDaniels should've been ejected but definitely not Klay.

2. Gobert DID grab Klay by the neck BUT for a very brief moment, and even as a Warriors fan and certified Gobert hater, it didn't look malicious for the reasons I stated above.

3. Draymond ABSOLUTELY escalates it and was clearly looking for any reason to jump on Gobert. He deserves to be suspended, though I have no opinion for how long. 

As an aside - yes, most of us (as third party observers) are constantly confused as to why the organization/Kerr defends Draymond. That said, anyone who has played on ANY sort of team should understand WHY the Warriors defend him, even if they silently disagree with his actions. You can't exactly call out a teammate and fracture the locker room. Staying connected is absolutely important. Any turd can understand that if their homie gets into a fight at the bar, regardless of who started it, you're backing him up. Yet, there still seems to be confusion as to why the Warriors/Kerr continue to do so. Sorry, but that's just the way it is in team sports. You have to backup your guy, even if you disagree with him.  

Anyways, what do you guys think? I'm curious as to everyone else's thoughts on this.",warriors,332,https://www.reddit.com/r/warriors/comments/17vzgcs/we_should_be_able_to_agree/

","Every year, there are so many posts about how the most winnest coach in NBA history and Olympic Gold medal-winning coach somehow doesn't know what he's doing out there because he's leaving a player in to try and work through a slump or letting Curry rest instead of burning him out for a single win. 

Every year, he allows the players who know the plays to rotate in and out of games. He'll play a particular lineup of players for 5-10 games and then change it up. He gathered data on player combos and how rotations affect defense, so he knows exactly who to play going into the playoffs. 

He often tightens up the roster following the All-Star break or once the 6-9 guys he's locking into playoff rotation are well-rested and ready for a run. He does this every single year. He and Pop did this during the Olympics, and he did it as head coach this year for the Olympics.

Theyre the one team that we all stand unified behind (minus a few Fakers fans, respek to 24/8) and they gave us an incredible run for multiple seasons, even when we didnt win they still put on one of the greatest shows in NBA history.

2024-10-07,1728280691,[Charlie Walton] The first thing I noticed when doing homework on Donte DiVincenzo was his off-ball movement. He has a great understanding of where to move and when to do it. He told the media today that he got it from Steph and Klay in Golden State. (<¥ @Timberwolves) ,"I hate that we couldnt afford to keep Donte, man, he was the perfect sponge for our system. I just love how you can tell by his answers here that he ***got it***, and by it I mean what makes the Warriors brand of basketball the best. It may not be easy, and it may require elite conditioning, but it being effective and *fun* to play makes it all worth it.  

I also love that he took everything he learned from Steph and Klay and Warriors ball and kept it in his game despite playing for teams that very much do not play the Warriors brand of basketball.   

&gt; **Reporter:** The way you play offense, Donte, just looks like Golden State. Is that always kind of who you were as a player or is that something where you really feel like you grew up in here?    
&gt; 
&gt; **Donte:** A little bit, but when I went out [to Golden State], just being with Steph, being with Klay, just the non-stop moving. What I picked up is the moving of the whole 24 seconds. Never standing still, because when youre standing still, the defense is resting when youre not moving around. Theyre going to mess up at some point, it might be within the first five, six, sevens of a clock, or it might be the last two, or three seconds. So thats kind of what I picked up there is just non-stop moving.    
&gt; 
&gt; You may not get the shot, but when youre moving around and youre making it hard for the defense, somebody else might get the shot. Thats the only thing you can hope for is a wide open shot.    
&gt; 
&gt; **Reporter:** Is that brand of basketball, like you exert yourself more - I mean, its more tiring, but somehow it still makes the game easier?    
&gt; 
&gt; **Donte:** I wouldnt say its more tiring, I would just say its more enjoyable. When youre playing that way and the ball doesnt stop as much, its not stagnant. Youre not watching one person go the whole time. That brand of basketball is a lot of fun to play.    
&gt;  
&gt; Now, when you have talent, and you can do both, I think thats the, you know, thats the perfect kind of concoction of offense is when you can settle down, let somebody go one-on-one, do their thing, and then also push the transition, get quick ones, get movement, because then the defense never knows what theyre getting.

I aint like it when I was on the other team, but I've definitely gotten to know him a lot better and I appreciate him.""","Full transcript of clip is below.   

**Reporter (don't recognize the voice so not sure who it was):** Do you ever worry about [Draymond's] temper getting away and causing him to miss games or anything like that?   

**CP:** Nope, not at all. I don't know if you've seen it, but shout out to Dray's podcast, we talked about it on there. And that I play with the same passion that he does, you know. So when he talks or yells or anything like that, I'm listening to what he's saying and not how he's saying it and I think that's what a lot of people don't do&in all types of situations. So I can appreciate his passion. If he wasn't like that, I mean, he wouldn't care. You know what I mean? So I know how bad he wants to win and I can have those conversations with him.   

**TK:** You talked about understanding Draymond's passion. There was that timeout early in the game where I guess he wanted Trayce or Podziemski on a couple of passes where he didn't get them on. And he definitely looked upset. I saw you kind of talk to him, not asking what you said. But is that a moment that you can understand maybe better? You can feel what he's feeling and you can talk to him a little bit?    

**CP:** No question.  No question.  And I tell you, I mean, you pay attention long enough and theres guys where plays happen and dont nobody say nothing. and then they just go home. And I tell you, show me somebody thats OK with losing, and Ill show you a loser. You know what I mean?  So, Drays passion is why they've won championships and stuff around here. I respect it. I aint like it when I was on the other team, you know what I mean?  But I've definitely gotten to know him a lot better and I appreciate him.  And that passion is why those blocks and those plays happen at the end of the game.

But look at how monstrous the West is right now. Nuggets are a very good team that won it all last year. They're currently getting dismantled by a very hungry Timberwolves team.  On the other side of the bracket is the youngest 1 seed OKC team  with cap space and a billion picks to improve. Also the most complete Mavs team Luka ever had. Not to mention the rise of Wemby and dark horses like a healthy Zion led pelicans or a drama free Grizzlies team, unlikely as it is.

These teams will beat the crap out of each other for the next half decade and some great players won't get rings. Meanwhile we peaked at the right time and won it all right before these guys ascended. Literally every major contributor from that run besides Curry and Dray has retired or regressed.

2024-08-20,1724113779,"Klay: ""I can handle the ball, but when I teamed up w/Steph &amp; Dray, we all had to play to our strengths. I'm at my best when I'm running around &amp; taking the defense w/me...ball may not be in my hands much &amp; I'm not going to be MVP but when you win &amp; put on for the city, that's a priceless feeling.""","Klay and DeMar DeRozan showed up to Dorell Wright's Hometown Favorites camp this past weekend to be guests for a Q&amp;A session and then serve as resources for them for the day, and this clip is from that Q&amp;A session. Unfortunately, the editing of the session into the final video for YouTube (wasn't me) accidentally cut off the question that led to this answer from Klay. But contextually, you can make out that it likely had something to do with his role and/or finding his role in the league and something involving him as a ball handler.    

The reason I wanted to upload it, other than the obvious being his incredible answer, was because of the incredible timing of him touching on this right after I saw Rico Hines' appearance on Pat Bev's pod talking about exactly this (during which he mentioned Looney, and I uploaded that portion of the pod to the sub earlier).   

Also the ambient background noise on the recording is pretty rough with this one. I tried to work some technological magic and lessen it, but it ended up making it worse every time. So apologies on that, but per usual, below is a transcript to help offset any issues making out what's being said.    

&gt; **Klay:** ""I think I can handle the ball, I did in high school. But when I teamed up with Steph and Draymond, we all had to play to our strengths. If you want to get to the highest levels, you *have* to make sacrifices. Like, I'm not going to be at my best if I'm handling the ball more than Draymond. I'm at my best when I'm running around, back cutting and taking the defense with me to try to get someone an open shot. And I figured that out quickly with them...I'm gonna run off the ball, Steph's going to do his thing with high PnR, and Draymond's going to also facilitate. The ball may not be in my hands much, but we're going to win a ton of games and have a chance to win championships. Accolades will come, I'm not going to be first team whatever or MVP but at the same time, you win and you put on for the city and that's a priceless feeling.    
&gt;    
&gt; For me, I figured out that to get the most out of myself, I accept that I'm not going to break you down one-on-one the most, but I'm going to get a teammate open and I'm going to use my teammates to get me open shots. And I figured out quickly that I can have a great career if I just worked and did the best I can in the system I was in. So, we all have to make sacrifices, there's usually only or two guys on a  team that can do whatever they want. But, when you win you have that forever, whether it's at the high school level, college level, or pro, there's ***nothing*** that trumps winning. That's a lifelong bond.    
&gt;    
&gt; So, when you're in the moment and you're like ""man, I know I can do this and coach isn't letting me do this and that,"" just remember that I gotta sacrifice for the team and it's all worth it for that chance to win.""    

Something I think that gets lost in the discourse and rhetoric, and just overall narratives with players is that just because we don't see a player doing a certain skill or playing a certain role in games, doesn't mean they're incapable of those things or that they're not doing them *because* they can't and therefore have to be limited to specific roles. But rather - and this doesn't always apply, of course, so that caveat applies - the role they're bought into doesn't ask those things of them and so playing their role well necessarily means not showing/using those skills in game.    

E.g. The narrative that Klay can't dribble that latched onto him for whatever reason, is so far from the truth it's comical; he became an elite catch and shoot 3&amp;D player because that was what they needed him to be, not because he can't dribble or create for himself. Same goes for Andre when he was with us. He played within the confines of a role that, in the words of Rico Hines, left out some of what he had to offer in his toolbox, but he did so because they figured out that if he played with a more limited set of the tools he had at his disposal and focused on being elite at just those things, he'd be help them win and once he saw that was the case he bought in and left behind a fairly significant part of his offensive game.

Played with Loon. Played with some of the greatest ever. Played with Wiggins. Met great guys. The staff is good. It was a cool experience","[Source Article by The Athletic's Anthony Slater - ""Hate the way it ended for Jordan: Poole, Warriors reflect on Golden State tenure and its end""](https://theathletic.com/5149477/2023/12/21/jordan-poole-golden-state-warriors/)

&amp;nbsp;




### Jordan Poole Reflects on his Time as a Dub:

&gt; **Successful time**, Poole said. Learned a lot. Cant ask for too much more than that. **Won a championship. Played with Loon. Played with some of the greatest ever. Played with (Andrew Wiggins). Met great guys. The staff is good. It was a cool experience**. It was just dope to accomplish something youve been looking for your entire life, winning a championship at the highest level, seeing what that takes.

*Followed by the One of the Quickest Back-and-forth Between Poole &amp; Slater*:

 &gt;After the interview, **he jokes that he shouldve gone full Marshawn Lynch. He basically did.**

&gt; **Slater**: How do you look back on the final season there and how everything went sideways?
&gt; 
&gt; **Poole**: Next question 
&gt; 
&gt; **Slater**: Is there any level of regret about how any of it unfolded?
&gt; 
&gt; **Poole**: Nah 
&gt; 
&gt; **Slater**: Were you upset with the Warriors at all about the way they handled the situation?
&gt; 
&gt; **Poole**: I can honestly say that I havent thought about it. I havent put too much thought into it.
&gt; 
&gt; **Slater**: What came from it?
&gt; 
&gt; **Poole**: I learned that Im built for tougher. I think that was pretty dope. I mean, being at the highest level, you get just, like, so much media, so much of everything just being with that organization. It made me realize I was built for a lot tougher.
&gt; 
&gt; **Slater**: Do you still watch them?
&gt; 
&gt; **Poole**: If the game is on

*On how it feels coming back to his old home*:

&gt; Ive never had the opportunity to go back and play somewhere where I used to play, Poole said. **So yeah, kind of just going in, and it should be cool. Spent four years there.**


&amp;nbsp;


### Jordan Poole's Favorite Game as a Warrior - 2022 West Semi-finals Game 1 vs Memphis (also was Kerr's favorite Poole game):

&gt; [Poole identified his favorite game with the Warriors as Game 1 in Memphis. **So did Kerr.**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C1HQYHMN0rc) Oh, yeah, when we played Tyus (Jones) and them, Poole said pointing to Jones, now his teammate, at an adjacent locker. Especially with it being on the road.

 

&amp;nbsp;

### Steve Kerr on Jordan Poole's Time as a Dub:

*On the Draymond Punch*



&gt; **I look back at that, and I hate that it happened**, Kerr said. **I know that in my heart, that when (the punch) happened, we handled it the best way we thought we could handle it. But in hindsight**  and hindsight is always 20/20  we could have done better for sure. I just hate the way it ended for Jordan here, because he is a huge success story. For us and for him, this was a great marriage. **He helped us win a title. We helped him, you know, become a champion and a guy who signed a big contract, life-changing contract. It was all wildly successful. But I hate the way it ended**.

*Poole's work ethic during the pandemic*

&gt; **He worked his ass off, earned everything, had to learn the hard way,** Kerr said. Threw him into the deep end right away, and he struggled. Pandemic year was hard on everybody. Then once the gym opened back up, he was in here every day. I always love when young guys learn from experience and figure out, OK, this is what I have to do. And then he went and did it.

*On the 3rd Season (Championship Season)*

&gt; **He was amazing**, Kerr said. There were a number of games where he just got caught fire and carried us when we desperately needed it. I remember a game in Phoenix early in the year. I think he had 28 or something at halftime and just went ballistic. **It was like we had a new toy. The guys on the team felt like, Oh, man, we got another guy who can go get it. It changed our outlook**. We were hoping we were a championship contender, but we didnt know.




&amp;nbsp;


### Kevon Looney on Jordan Poole's time as a Dub:

*Looney's Favorite Game from Poole*

&gt; Against the Denver Nuggets, Poole scored 30, 29 and 27 points in the first three games of the series. Looney called that his favorite stretch from Poole, [remembering **one transition 3 against DeMarcus Cousins** that had the crowd in a frenzy. Thats when I was like, **Oh, hes going to be really good,'**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-vFkVWkCFo) Looney said. Doing that in his first playoff experience, not nervous? Steph came off the bench, and he still put on a show.


*Memphis Series*

&gt;He bailed us out a lot in that playoff run, Looney said.

*On the 2022-23 Season+Lakers playoffs loss*

&gt; I think he got a bad rap for that year, Looney said. I mean, he averaged 20 points, and he helped us get to the playoffs. You know, **when Steph was down for a while, him and Klay really kept us afloat**. We made a run to get out of the Play-In and won a series. **So I think he gets a bad rap. It wasnt all bad that year. It mightve felt that way.**

*On the Draymond Punch*:

&gt; Poole has remained reticent to speak about the Draymond Green punch and its aftermath since the moment it happened. Green has discussed it publicly plenty. Poole deflects and downplays at every opportunity, a private approach that was always respected and appreciated internally....But **Poole never missed a day of work or demanded any particular punishment**. He handled it professionally, Kevon Looney said.

&gt; &amp;nbsp;

&gt; Situation like that, theres only so much you can do, Looney said. Especially with all the coverage we get on our team, all the media and everything thats going on, the video getting out. **I feel like we handled it as best we could. You know, Draymond and JP were professional. They didnt have no more blow-ups during the season. They might have felt awkward, but they didnt let it affect their play on the court**. They still played hard. They still played together.











&amp;nbsp;


### Steph Curry's Favorite Jordan Poole Game - 2022 NBA Finals Game 6 vs Boston (Also on the Punch):

&gt; Currys three favorite Poole moments all came during the NBA Finals. During that [**Game 6** clincher in Boston, the Warriors went down eight in the first quarter.

Reminiscent of the three-quarter court shot I hit against Memphis in 2015, Curry said. Big, loud momentum plays.

*On Draymond's Punch*

&gt; Unless you were in this building, you **can always talk about what couldve been punishment-wise**, Curry said. **But unless you were in here, having these conversations daily and everything that we tried to keep in the house that then got out, it made everything a lot more complicated. We obviously will be scrutinized for whatever happens. We did the best we could with a very hard situation.** Between them two, thats whatever its going to be between them two.

### Klay Thompson on Jordan Poole's Time as a Dub:

*Klay's Favorite Game from Poole*

&gt; Thompsons favorite moment next to Poole came during that 2021-22 regular season. [Poole] was Thompsons backup but also Currys. Curry went out with a foot sprain in March. [There was one game we were starting together where I think **I went for 35 and he went for 30**, Thompson said. We were **playing the Jazz and came back from down 20**. It was a great moment for us to know, you know, we can do this. Thompsons memory is a point short. He had 36, and Poole had 31.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XURFWMH-Af0) 

&gt; &amp;nbsp;

*Klay hopes Dub Nation shows Poole some love tomorrow*

&gt; **We would not have won a championship in 22 without him**, Thompson said. Simple as that. So **I hope Dub Nation shows him the right ovation on Friday night**.

&gt; It was unfortunate what happened because he helped us raise a banner, Thompson said. **But at the end of the day, time heals all wounds, and Dub Nation will be forever grateful for the Poole Party. I know I will.**",warriors,190,https://www.reddit.com/r/warriors/comments/18nrncn/slater_jordan_poole_steve_kerr_kevon_looney_klay/

2024-01-16,1705438115,Advice from an old NBA fan: Don't hate this year Warrior fans; enjoy and store these last remaining games away in your memory bank before this core is traded off forever.,"The nine-year run this group of vets has gone through is nothing short of historic and something you're not likely to enjoy again in your lifetime. There's always a chance the Warriors will put together another team worthy of the finals in the coming few years (not this year), but don't expect it; savor the highs and lows and let your anger go. 

I wish I had paid a little more attention during the Michael Jordan years and just saved some of those games in my memory bank. He left so abruptly, and the league was never the same. It's so special, and you really have no idea how fast it's over forever until it happens. 

You really don't realize how wild the ""Splash Brothers"" are until a few seasons from now, and you're watching other teams, realizing how insane these two three-point shooters were in their prime and how nothing will for another decade or more. Sadly, great players end their careers in three ways: they retire out of the blue while still in their prime, they have a career-ending injury, or they get traded to a garbage team and come off the bench for five sad minutes of glory while the fans cheer one last time for their dying hero, maybe they even get a standing ovation. All three are heartwrenching and will happen to this roaster one way or another. 

Please don't spend this season in angry on this subreddit or yelling at your TV. Don't play the pointless blame game. The Warriors dynasty was a beautiful bouquet of flowers that bloomed brighter and longer than anyone could've expected. They changed the game of basketball. They destroyed the league to the point where it was almost unfair. The Warriors could yawn through the first half and then come out and kill a team with a 20-point run in just a few minutes. Opponents had to exhaust all their timeouts in the third just to try and slow them down; it was unreal! The way the Warriors defied all odds and won against the Celtics was the cherry on top, my fellow fans. The fall of a dynasty is not pretty, so please, don't hold on too tightly, and just enjoy the vet's play because trading off the team for fresh stars is not a guarantee back to the finals; it's another longshot.

2024-04-21,1713741873,"TIL Jonathan Kuminga is younger than Brandon Miller, Chet Holmgren, etc. at age 21 he is still like 3-4 years away from the START of his prime anyone who thinks he is not an incredibly valuable asset is tripping. He is like 99th% in athleticism with all 3 of speed, strength, and explosiveness!","Now the question remains what will this team do going forward. Steph want the team to improve, what does that mean?  I expect legit internal growth from all 4 of our young guys. I think Podz will take a leap next year, Moody looks primed for an expanded role, TJD is almost a lock as our starting center (this will be huge for the team and himself) and then Kuminga is really the x-factor can he really develop his shot creation and ball handling enough. He has improved a lot year over year but this was really the first year of consistent playing time, given how much this aided his rapid growth, the spurt of back to back to back games of 20+ points on elite efficiency should have us excited. I think he is an asset teams will truly covet and whether we keep him and develop him (believing he could become an all star or all nba) is a massive question. It will be hard for us to improve markedly without trading him sadly. The only players I see that if it was possible to move him for would be either Paul George or Lauri Markannen. These are outside chances, and likely not happening but Lauri doesnt fit Jazz timeline hes turning 27 while Keyonte George and Hendricks, Kessler are all like 20-21. If the clippers are bounced early again they could have big changes both PG and Harden could become FA this offseason and the clippers could keep both, or choose to move on from PG as they already locked up Kawhi. The havent extended him yet which makes one question. If the warriors make that deal it basically confirms definitively a path, they are going to at least attempt to get steph more help and at least make some noise in the playoffs and give yourself a chance. A team of TJD/Green/George/Wiggins/Curry could be so dynamic and explosive + has actual size and 4 great defenders. That team could do something I believe. With PG as a true secondary shot creator, slotting wiggins into a 3rd easy. With Moody/Podz/TJd on cheap deals and a few other mins. On the other hand getting Lauri give us a totally different look. TJD Green Markkannen Wiggins Curry, not as good defensively but a 1-2 punch lauri and steph with how good both are as snipers. plus Lauri almost gets 10 rebounds a night and is 7ft. its like ultra budget KD lol

Just a side note, if you believe that it is IMPOSSIBLE to build a contender around steph that it is OVER as I have read, than what do you want to do? as long as we have steph and draymond we are probably not a lottery team. Especially if we kept all 4 of the young guys. Thoughts?",warriors,236,https://www.reddit.com/r/warriors/comments/1c9vxu8/til_jonathan_kuminga_is_younger_than_brandon/

&amp;nbsp;


### Klay was firm on leaving &amp; asked Steph to not intervene:

&gt; Its been a layered five-year path to this divorce, splintering last season, sprouting earlier and finalizing in the last couple weeks, where among the conversations Thompson had, league sources said  was **a request of Stephen Curry not to exert his significant organizational influence and up the temperature with management to ensure Thompsons return**. Currys measured voice, even if it altered the outcome, **wouldnt change the genuineness of Joe Lacob and the front offices true desire** to have Thompson back.

&amp;nbsp;

### Recap of the Benching Incidents that Upset Klay this past season:

&gt; During an early December game in Phoenix  the same night Green nailed Jusuf Nurki and earned an indefinite suspension  Thompson was pulled from the closing lineup for the first time in his career. In a fit of rage after learning the decision, Thompson whacked a cup rack behind the bench to the ground and needed to be pulled back by Curry as he lit up the coaching staff in the huddle.

-

&gt; In Salt Lake City when Kerr, on the second night of a back-to-back, informed Thompson hed be moving to the bench. Hed occupied the Warriors starting shooting guard spot for more than a decade, 727 consecutive games when healthy. It was an identity more than just a title. That news didnt land softly. **Thompson ripped into Kerr and his staff, team sources said**, and spent some of that day grumbling about his inevitable summer departure from the franchise. His impending free agency loomed in the background all season.

-

&gt; Kerr made some sensitive coaching decisions last season that, in retrospect, played a part in nudging Thompson out the door. In Kerrs exit interview, he mentioned the desire to bring Thompson off the bench again (he won his starting job back by the end of the season) and the need to play him less in general


&amp;nbsp;

### Warriors Hoped the version of ""self-reflective"" Klay would lead him back to them:

&gt;Thompson and Kerr sat down for several heart-to-hearts over the last few seasons. **Thompson detailed a few publicly, thanking Kerr for reminding him he needed to enjoy the final years of a historic career** and not anguish over a chase to reclaim what he once was prior to the injuries. 

&gt; **That version of Thompson is the reason so many within the Warriors expected him to circle back around in recent weeks, have all the necessary reconciliation conversations and ultimately decide on a reunion.** Hes deeply proud of what he helped build and went into detail about his desire to remain with the Warriors forever prior to last season

&amp;nbsp;

### Joe Lacob &amp; Warriors FO's Big Mistake: Treating &amp; Negotiating with Klay like he was like Steph, Kerr, Bob, Andre, &amp; Draymond:

&gt;**Controlling owner Joe Lacob led a front-office effort to take a cold, mostly uncommunicative approach to Thompsons next contract in his three summers of extension eligibility, team sources said, which isnt separate from their norm**. Lacob has done similar in the past with Curry, Kerr, Bob Myers, Andre Iguodala and Green, using dwindling time as a weapon but ultimately paying up after a staring contest.

&gt;But Iguodalas (in 2017) and Greens (in 2023) are the two parallel situations that have popped up most in conversation about the split with Thompson that blindsided some Warriors executives in recent weeks. **Iguodala and Green, both sharp and versed in the corporate world, used leverage to exact a better deal from the Warriors.** Iguodala took his decision deep into free agency.

&gt;**Thompson operates on his own wavelength.** The Warriors decision-makers were warned that a drawn-out negotiation into July during this free-agent cycle wouldnt be met the same way. He wasnt trying to leverage his way back until the bitter end

&gt; But **his decision, as one source put it, became easy when the Warriors kicked him down the summer pecking order.** They paid a record luxury-tax bill last season and didnt make the playoffs, a cost-versus-benefit that is untenable

&gt;**There was little communication between Thompson, the Warriors and Thompsons agent**, Greg Lawrence, and ultimately no offer in this cycle. Warriors sources maintained a plan to eventually make a competitive offer in relation to his market once other business was settled. But they never had the chance. **Many league sources said Thompsons decision to depart was unofficially made weeks ago.**

&gt; Warriors sources will mention the **two-year, $48 million offer put on Thompsons desk back in the preseason...But the two sides have differing versions of the firmness of the offer** and, again, the true desire of the franchises lead decision-makers in valuing him as a cant-lose member of the core, only becoming more complicated when Myers (the ultimate communicator) ceded his high-ranking position

2024-03-28,1711651984,"An adult perspective on Draymond Green, Klay Thompson, and Andrew Wiggins","Hi there. Adult here. Middle-aged adult, meaning I've been an adult longer than I was a kid/teen. I've known a lot of people and been through a lot of life. And I've been watching basketball for decades, but I still feel like I'm scratching the surface of understanding the game.

Let's start here: Sports talk and sports opinion are generally meaningless, mere sound and fury to fill time on air and pixels on a screen, to sell ads against. Sports pundits tend to dehumanize the people who play pro and college sports into two-dimensional characters, like from fiction. I used to love this stuff when I was a kid, and grew out of it when I realized I wasn't learning anything from them.

I've heard and read a lot of misguided ""professional"" opinions about Draymond the past few years, and I've seen them aped in Reddit comments and posts. 

Among those opinions are: Draymond is selfish. Draymond is just doing what he wants to do and doesn't care about the team. Steph is sick of Draymond's s\*\*\*. Steph is enabling Draymond. If Steph or Kerr were a real leader, they'd control Draymond. The team is coddling Draymond because he's been there for four trophies. The team needs to dump Draymond because he's an embarrassment or detrimental to the team.

There's also a difference between being a child fan and an adult fan. One's feelings about Wiggins' personal problems the past two years are a pretty good litmus test between those mindsets. So is watching Klay's struggles to understand what kind of a player he is in the twilight of his career. 

The major difference between being a child fan and an adult fan is the understanding that the guys on your favorite team are human beings. They may seem like TV show characters or superheroes -- they're bigger than us, they're stronger than us, they have special powers. And most of the time that we see them, they're in their costumes. 

But they're not superheroes; they're humans. They are either growing and learning from their failures, or they're not. But growing and learning are hard, and most of us adults aren't great at it. It's what makes us human.

If you've been around long enough, you've known people like Wiggins, Klay, and Draymond. And the main thing you learn is how little you know about them, how impossible it is to judge them as people based on the little sliver you see on the court or podcasts.

Draymond may be selfish; I don't know him personally, and couldn't tell you how he treats people in his life. But selfishness isn't why he gets ejected and suspended. His major issue is that he's profoundly emotional, and he lets his emotions control him sometimes.

Great leaders are able to notice and observe their emotions, so they can manage them and remain in control of themselves. You saw Steph go through this last night -- he had a very powerful emotional reaction to watching Draymond relapse, and then he managed his emotions and two hours later sunk a dagger. Nighty-night.

This is Draymond's greatest issue. Even after 20 years of college and professional basketball, he frequently loses control of his emotions when on the court. It's safe to assume he does it in his private life, too. That's it, that's the whole story.

If you've known adults with emotional control problems, you know that there isn't much others can do for that person when they're fully flooded with emotion. Steph can't get between Dray and the ref to manage the situation. Kerr can't say a magic word to reverse the neurochemical reactions happening in Dray's brain.  

If you yourself have ever regretted doing or saying anything while in an emotional state (and you have!), you know that nobody was going to be able to check your emotions for you. You have to do it yourself.

Draymond clearly has a lot of work to do on himself, and the grind of an NBA schedule gives him no space to do that. Certainly not between back-to-back road games in different cities. He said the suspension gave him that time, but changing your brain isn't something you do over a few weeks. It's a lifelong process. 

Last night's ejection, in Dray terms, wasn't that bad. He lost control in the first minutes of the game, and on the second T, at least he had the sense to put his head down and walk to the tunnel.

We've seen Klay grow this year. We've come to understand that Wiggins' life has complications that are more important than our satisfaction with him, and he doesn't want the details to become another idiotic sports opinion / gossip topic. (Good call, Wiggs!) 

Everyone in Dub Nation hopes that Draymond can grow, too. That he can control his anger, and that we never see him stomp, punch, or choke another player again. People who have been watching the game for a long time also know why the Warriors accommodate his on-court tirades, and why other teams in history also put up with guys like him.

Last night was disappointing. It probably wasn't the last time we'll see Dray's emotions take control of his actions. I want to see him get better at this in the offseason. At just age 34, he has plenty of time and the resources to do this. 

And it'd be even better if he can keep it together for another couple months, so we can hold off Houston and make another run.

Go Dubs.",warriors,160,https://www.reddit.com/r/warriors/comments/1bq3fqx/an_adult_perspective_on_draymond_green_klay/

2024-03-05,1709677641,"From Kendra Andrews article re: Wiggs absence and return: ""I don't care about the basketball. Life is way more important than the game,"" Kerr said. ""The main thing is if any of our players have a life situation where they need to be with their family, then that's where they're going to be.""","Link to article, which FYI doesnt add much beyond this quote that hasnt already been posted to the sub, is [here](https://www.espn.com/nba/story/_/id/39660752/warriors-andrew-wiggins-return-vs-bucks-wednesday). 

Steve may make some frustrating/head scratching (to us fans, ie to those not privy to all info/considerations/strategies, etc. that went into the decisions) coaching decisions in-game, but he gets it and Im not sure theres ever been a coach in this league that so perfectly straddles and maintains perspective on the NBA work/life balance. In particular, what is and always will be most important. 

The number of former Warriors players that have come out since their time with the Warriors and talked about how the Warriors organization and the culture that Steve created and set is unlike anywhere else in the league and how much they loved it, further proves that to be the case. Just a few:   

Quinn Cook:   

&gt; ""When Golden State calIed,"" Cook recalled, ""I told my agent, 'I didn't care if I never play. I don't have to play. I just want to be a part of the organization. I want to learn every single day from those guys.' And not just because the Warriors had just won and had won two of the last three NBA Finals, and gone to three straight Finals. It wasn't just that. It was just the people that were there. ""Just being there, it just meant a lot,"" Cook said. ""It just meant a lot, having relationships with those guys. It means the world to me because it was a true family. They accepted me and they accepted all the young guys who were new to the team, and they treated us like every other player, man. Just to have relationships with guys like that, to learn from guys like that, it means the world and it's something I cherish to this day.""

Matt Barnes:   
&gt; ""I was blessed with the opportunity to come fu** with you guys right before I was done,"" Barnes said on the Point Forward podcast. ""I'm just like, you look at all these superstars from KD, to Steph, to Klay, to Draymond on the rise to the super solid vets and rockstar head coach, and at least while I was there, there was no egos. You know what I mean? Everyone left that sh** at the door. Getting a chance to be on a team that talented where it's just about winning, I was like, damn, if the world can understand, to me that's a secret of why you guys won&.That environment is second to none. You know, from ownership doing everything you need, all you have to do is go out there and play basketball. The way you guys love and fu**with each other like that, like that's not normal,"" Matt added.   

Even KD himself just this season praised the culture:  

&gt; ""It's fun being a Warrior,"" Durant told Logan Murdock of The Ringer before the season opener. ""It's fun traveling with the Warriors because it's a family atmosphere wherever we went. I can have two of my homeboys on a plane with me just because, on a random-ass, one-day road trip. That's how tight it was.""  

GPII, who is obviously still a current player but one that's been through many organizations during his time in the league so is one to know:   

&gt; ""This organization is about doing things together,"" Payton said. ""On the road, we have a lot of team dinners the organization puts on for us. Guys have kids with birthdays and they invite everyone over, complete with family from the front office down. I've never been somewhere where it's family-based like that. Players here really care for one another and enjoy watching each other have success. You don't get that in a lot of places around the league.""

# Steph wishes the best for Klay and justwants him to be happy:

&gt; I havent seen him in person (since his decision), so there hasnt been the official send-off that our history and our experience deserves.

Thats why right now, still, like I know its real and I know were moving on, but there are still more steps to take.

&gt; (The phone call) was more so just me making sure that he knew (how I felt). I didnt want him carrying any weight of (him thinking I believed) he was making a bad decision or a wrong decision, or whatever the case was, because it was his decision



&amp;nbsp;

# Steph thought, outside of the years, the 2-yr $48 mil offer last year was a fair offer to Klay :

&gt;  It is a business, and theyre supposed to try to position us to be successful with all the things that (go into it). Its not just a three-man team....I wasnt part of those conversations. I do know about the extension last fall (when Thompsons agent, Greg Lawrence of the Wasserman Media Group, and the **Warriors had discussions about a two-year, $48 million deal) and thinking that that was a fair offer that signified what Klay meant  outside of the length of the contract, which I know was a big deal (to Thompson).**


&gt;**I wish it would have gone differently, in the sense of whatever Klay needed (from the Warriors) to not feel disrespected**. I cant answer that, because thats a Klay thing to talk about. I wish thats how it would have gone down. But I also know that because he needed a fresh start, things were kind of looked at a little differently. And that was kind of the throughline of this whole last season

&amp;nbsp;

# Steph on Klay asking him to not use his influence:

&gt; **Steph**: I think thats why Klay was so adamant that I not get involved, because whatever outcome he wanted, he wanted to make sure it was a kind of a pure process. And at the end of the day, we all have to make decisions that are in the best interest of yourself. Ill do that at times when its whats right for me.

&gt; **Amick**: And you said that you still did use your voice on his situation, so what was your message to the team?

&gt; **Steph**: We want Klay back. Im not gonna tell them what number it is (on the contract). Im not gonna tell them (anything beyond that). Again, part of the way we operate is that theres always conversation. When anything changes, I just want to know whats up, to know where everybody stands. Its not like Im telling everybody how to think or act, because we all get paid to do our separate jobs...(Hes) the first one of us three to go.


&amp;nbsp;

# Steph's Favoirte Klay Memory: Jan 9, 2022 aka Klay Day (Klay's return from injury vs Cavs):

&gt; (On the call with Thompson), I was talking about his (Jan. 9, 2022) game when he came back from his (Achilles) injury against Cleveland two years ago (at Chase Center), and the reception that the crowd gave him when he walked on the court for pregame shooting and I was already out there getting shots up wearing my throwback Klay Thompson sleeve jersey. Its him walking on the court, the crowd going crazy.

&gt; But the way that the crowd reacted to him tells you everything about his relationship with the Bay Area. He was shooting shots pregame and they were clapping like it was in the middle of the fourth quarter every time he made a shot. And **Im trying to keep a straight face, but I just became a fan in that moment. We all can talk about all the amazing games hes had, or Game 6 Klay, all that type of stuff. But that was my favorite (memory) just because, in a very hard time, it reminded everybody how important he was to the whole franchise and this whole journey.**",warriors,84,https://www.reddit.com/r/warriors/comments/1dyaqsw/amick_steph_i_hope_that_before_klays_over_in/

Full transcript below, the entire two minute exchange was perfection:   

&gt;**Isiah Thomas:** Yeah, give Steph and Sabrina a lot of credit for stepping on the stage and having the courage to really put their talents on display and not only having the courage, but we all know Steph is the greatest shooter ever and the way he shoots the basketball, but he's also probably the most gracious superstar ever that we've seen in our league because most superstars today, they're not stepping out like this. They're saying, I don't want to take the risk of possibly losing. He's so gracious, he's saying, hey, even if I lose, it's a win because it makes the game better, and that's the beauty of Steph.
&gt;
&gt;**Grant Hill:** It really is. I mean, the fear, the noise on social media, all that comes with the possibility of losing, you know, and Steph doing it.
&gt;
&gt;And what I admired - first of all, Sabrina was great. I picked her to win. I was wrong. So, I just believe in her and I've been such an admirer of her, her game, her shooting, what she did in the All-Star game this past summer.
&gt;
&gt;But the joy, we talk about the joy that Steph plays with and you saw it. I was sitting out here and when Sabrina finished with 26, he was cheering. Like he was happy for her!  And then went and beat her, but he was happy and that joy and that mutual respect.
&gt;
&gt;It must be something to just be like, ""I'm the best shooter in the world."" I wonder if he goes and looks in the mirror every once in a while and says, ""I'm just the best shooter in the world.""
&gt;
&gt;**Isiah Thomas:** Okay, but how about the confidence that Sabrina had to challenge the best shooter in the world on an open stage like this? I mean, you're talking about two people who are supremely confident in their shooting skills, not like you and I, Grant.   
&gt;
&gt;**Grant Hill:**  No, no.
&gt;
&gt;**Isiah Thomas:** We wouldn't try to get on this stage and challenge anybody like this.
&gt;
&gt;**Grant Hill:** No, no, no. In front of all these people? Oh, no!    
&gt;
&gt;**Isiah Thomas:** But it was beautiful, beautiful show of shooting exhibition.

Kyrie isnt winning us the chip against Boston, I dont even know if we would make the finals in 2022 if we had Kyrie instead of Steph. Kyrie is a great player but hes not a top 5-10 player like Steph. 

If you want to contend, Kyrie is the ideal number 2 option to have. On the other hand, Steph is THE ENTIRE SYSTEM of a contending team. 

Anyways, I hope Steph silences everyone next season.

Tmac can have an opinion to not have Steph in his top 10, Im okay with that, but his reason is just so stupid.

2024-09-24,1727190741,I believe in Andrew Wiggins,"This man was on fire during the start of 22-23 season. Despite this, he had to file multiple long period of leaves just to deal with personal / family matters, which ultimately killed his momentum. 

He also had to brush of the rumours of his wife cheating on him with his friend and having an illegitimate child. 

He returned for the 22-23 playoffs. Played meaningful defense and faught tooth and nail with Steph Curry vs the Kings. Defended LeBron majority of time during the 2nd round, which resulted in injuring his rib. He took the risk, sacrificed his body, and played with a broken rib just to have a chance of advancing the playoffs. 

Took the 23-24 off season by recovering from his injury while continuing to support his family.

Started the 23-24 season beyond poorly, got benched but eventually started to get his groove mid season. Random injuries and personal/family leaves killed his momentum again. 

He placed his head down and ended last season decently by being functional and playing alongside the starting line up with Kuminga. 

Rough start to the upcoming season with Wiggins grieving for the loss of his father. Hope he can stay focus and enjoy playing meaningful and consistent minutes of basketball.

He's grateful with the organization for understanding his situation. I believe he will make the most of it and repay what was given to him during the last two years. Hope the community will also continue to be patient with him and have faith that he will bounce back. 

Sorry for the rough English and all the love to Warriors fans! ",warriors,121,https://www.reddit.com/r/warriors/comments/1foevzv/i_believe_in_andrew_wiggins/

2024-02-14,1707886394,"Dray on his podcast explained that Steph called an audible at the start of the 2nd half vs Jazz and told Dray and Klay they were going to run Oklahoma, a play so old its no longer in their playbook and only Dray and Klay know it. It got Klay this 3, and from there he went 7/11 for 17 pts.","I thought this was cool insight from Draymond and a really great example of the very very subtle ways Stephs leadership shows itself. He mentioned it in the following context on his most recent podcast:  

&gt; It was good to see Klay have a good game, see Klay get back on track and have the game that he did after last couple games not playing down the stretch and all the noise that's been surrounding him really all year and free agency and not having a deal done and blah, blah, blah.
&gt;
&gt;As I've always said, Klay is a very, very resilient person.  Number one, you don't come back from an ACL injury and Achilles injury if you're not resilient. You don't win four championships if you're not resilient and be a key cog in winning those championships. If you're not resilient, you don't score 60 points in three quarters. If you're not resilient, you don't score 37 in a quarter. And quite frankly, you are not Klay Thompson if you're not resilient.
&gt;
&gt;So to see him have the game that he had last night with all the chatter and stuff, I thought it was good. And then I also thought it was beautiful just how patient he was, he didn't force anything. He let the game come to him. If they ran him off the line, he stepped in and took some 2s and I thought that was really key. He got a couple of layups to start the game. He hit the three, he got a fast break layup. Start the second half, he got another layup. So I think it was good for him early on just to see the ball go through the rim.
&gt;
&gt;And then Steph Curry made a very key call in the 2nd half that I think really unlocked Klay and that was, we ran this play called Oklahoma where it's a double screen. So Klay is the first screener, I'm the second screener. Steph comes off both screens and then I pin in for Klay. And Klay came in and hit the three, and he was like, yes, like crazy fist pump. Or maybe even like a double *Dray holds both fists up*, ah! And from there it was just kind of flowing for him and I thought that was a huge call by Steph.
&gt;
&gt;It's also funny because I'm not even sure JK and Wiggs really even know what that play is. It's like an old play that we had from way back in the day. And when Steph called it, he just said it to me and I be like, ""Klay! Klay, come here!"" and so us three know what we're running and we just tell Wiggs and JK, hey man, just go to the corner, go to the corner and we run the play. 
&gt;
&gt;And I think that's just funny because number one is just how long we've been playing together. Like oftentimes we'll call plays that's not in the playbook this year, but that we know, that we've run once upon a time. It's always funny putting guys in positions that obviously haven't been there all the years and just kind of telling them, yo, go stand there. But that's a little funny nugget from last night's game.",warriors,66,https://www.reddit.com/r/warriors/comments/1aqeph3/dray_on_his_podcast_explained_that_steph_called/

Super loyal to friends &amp; relationships. Finesse over power. Shooting over driving. Leaves oxygen in the room for others. Doesnt have to always be the No.1 guy.""   ","Full transcript below the best 4.5 minutes Ive ever heard giving Steph his flowers in a way NBA media has always refused to do =ã>á    

They finally had Wiggins was back.  Chris, Paul, Steph, they finally had a full team.  Here we go.  Everybodys back.  Steph was amazing.  Milwaukee hung for a while.  Warriors blow them out late with a gigantic fourth quarter.   

You know, we pay so much attention, and probably should, to LeBrons greatness, age, and longevity.  We forget, Stephs 36 very soon.  Is he the anti-LeBron in many forms?  Built a dynasty with his first team.  Super loyal to friends and relationships.  Finesse over power.  Shooting over driving.  Leaves oxygen in the room for others.  Doesnt have to always be the number one guy.    

Just think about what he has dealt with this season, Steph Curry.  Draymond Green, long suspension.  The death of an assistant coach.  Andrew Wiggins, another personal leave.  The drama of Klay Thompson going to the bench.  Chris Paul arrives, hall of fame guard, uh oh, and then misses a big chunk of the season.  Bob Myers leaves as a beloved general manager.  Hes also trying to connect two generations two of their best young players, 21 years old. And then you got Draymond, Chris Paul, him. And heres Steph, 27 a game, cool as ever, shooting 41% on threes. Drama has surrounded him forever. Even when he first got there. Do you keep Steph? Monte Ellis? He creates the Splash Brothers. The KD comes, KD leaves. The Draymond stuff. The changing of the guard, Mark Jackson to Steve Kerr.    

**None of it phases him. He's never frazzled and remains the absolute rock. Foundational piece, the steady soul of this great franchise.**      

**Forget his superior game. The difference between him and other great guards, James Harden and Kyrie Irving, is a mile wide in terms of leadership, a get it quality, self-awareness, intangibles.  Hes a remarkable player. You dont get any of this ridiculous, I am the man. Put some respect on it, nonsense. It's all about basketball IQ, working well with others, making things work, lubricating, not agitating, adapting, evolving, dealing with KD. He's had a lot of players with a lot of baggage and drama. Just look at this year and what he's dealt with...and here are the Warriors again.**     

He's also never demanding on coaches. I like LeBron, but he can be passive aggressive, little drops in the media, putting pressure on a GM and owner or a coach. We've seen it a half dozen times in LA.    

**And I think the four best guards I've ever seen in my life in professional basketball, and I've watched it since the early 70s, are Michael Jordan, Magic Johnson, Kobe Bryant, and Steph Curry. And he's the only one that could play with all of them. Get along with all of them. You could put him on any all-time team. If he played with Michael, he'd be like, hey, I'll just run around. If you spot me open, throw it. Kobe was hard to play with, Steph could play with him. He worked with KD. KD can be a lot, got along great. He gets along with everybody, and that's an underrated skill.**    

I love LeBron, think he's the all-time best at doing great things across the board. But there are some things about Steph I strongly prefer.   

And last night, another classic performance. The band is finally all back together. They add Chris Paul. Its a new GM. The death of an assistant. Klay comes off the bench. Young kids everywhere. And theyre blowing out Milwaukee. Great win.    

Warriors, finally, the entire unit is back. And I'll make my call: Warriors end up in the Western Conference Finals against Denver. I'm calling it out right now. Celtics-Nuggets make the Finals. Warriors get to the Western Conference Final.   ",warriors,166,https://www.reddit.com/r/warriors/comments/1b99c14/cowherd_w_an_alltimer_of_a_spittin_facts/
