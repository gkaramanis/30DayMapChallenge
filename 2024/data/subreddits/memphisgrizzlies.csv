If youre unfamiliar with the video game GT7, it is the best driving simulator out there and is only on PlayStation. 

The game includes a robust livery/wrap creator where you can import all of your own files to create any design imaginable. After I created this Memphis Grizzlies Ferrari F430, I then used the in game photo suite called Scapes to capture lifelike images of the car in various locations throughout the world. Sadly, the city of Memphis isnt available on Scapes. 

Let me know what you think of the design.

2024-10-14,1728921771,r/memphisgrizzlies predictions thread for the 2025 NBA season: The Results,"A couple of days ago I posted [this thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/memphisgrizzlies/comments/1g1mzp8/rmemphisgrizzlies_predictions_thread_for_the/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button) asking the subreddit for how they thought this season would pan out in the NBA and also for the Grizzlies specifically (I'll leave it open for a bit longer if you missed the original post) here ill write a quick breakdown of what the subs thoughts were, ill make another write up in June seeing how right (or wrong) we were.

# 1. Who will be NBA champions?

[Celtics lead with a strong percentage of 40.3&amp;#37;, Grizzlies with a solid 27.6&amp;#37;.](https://preview.redd.it/ypys2ucwgqud1.png?width=600&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3161b8a26062ca87c52bd5597a184f55990addaa)

Not too surprised by the results here, last years finalists the Mavericks only having 5.2% after a good offseason is a bit surprising, ill also address the elephant in the room of 27.6% for the Grizzlies which is probably wishful thinking, but I love the optimism so who am I to question it?

# 2. Who in the East will make it to the finals?

[Celtics dominate once again.](https://preview.redd.it/ahpdr9dbiqud1.png?width=600&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d6c57554f992f3a87260e47f192d2ad59231459d)

The sub doesn't seem too interested by the offseason acquisitions of PG13 for the Sixers and KAT for the Knicks and those who didn't pick Boston to go all the way have them losing in the finals to whoever comes out of the west.

# 3. Who in the West will make it to the finals?

[Grizzlies lead, OKC not too far behind.](https://preview.redd.it/bfb6qgvujqud1.png?width=600&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8a59e363038d1ad5f8446b2df7423866a21c5f8e)

Last year's conference finalists both only combine for 18.6%, not too surprising to see OKC highly rated we all know of the young core they have and with the additions of Hartenstein and Caruso things are only going to get better for them. Next up is the awards seasons predictions 

# 4. Who will win MVP?

[Luka leads, Gligeous-Alexander and Morant complete the podium.](https://preview.redd.it/vtosj1v0mqud1.png?width=605&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4d28b73fbc067f7ff3ae9b9769c0a319269f3aa0)

Recently the NBA has been heading towards a big man renaissance of sorts, the results here don't really reflect that (in the next 2 categories they definitely do) SGA is a generational talent and was close to winning it last year, Luka is putting up record breaking numbers on a weekly basis and clearly there's a LOT of hype for Morant's return on here. Meanwhile half a dozen or so of the voters still have faith in Tatum and Embiid managed 2 votes, I was one of them :).

# 5. Who will win Rookie of the year?

[Absolute domination from Edey.](https://preview.redd.it/ltjs1nqbnqud1.png?width=600&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d97b8a2c7c3cb5fbbbcf2e4d7c960089b81614ff)

Combine him already being the clear betting favourite as well as a lot of Edey fans on this sub and it was never in question, personally I'm a Risacher believer but it is hard to argue against Edey. Buzelis, Castle and Tidjane with 1 vote each.

# 6. Who will win Defensive Player of the year?

[Wembanyama to get his first of many.](https://preview.redd.it/gfzrl87zoqud1.png?width=600&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3089ce419860605f666dd4ab8bbef9b571c4644f)

What many believed to be the deserved winner last year with a strong showing in the DPOY rankings, I doubt Jackson Jr. gets another after the controversy of his win but nice to see the positivity. Gobert, Jones and Antetokounmpo make an appearance with 1 vote each.

# 7. What will be the Grizzlies win count this season?

[67.2&amp;#37; believe the Grizzlies reach the 50 win mark at the minimum.](https://preview.redd.it/ddc1e4qfqqud1.png?width=600&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3d4b5bdfdd4ef45be5f24faf33e5f362dff45118)

The majority seem to believe we can come close to matching our best ever season. One vote for &gt;35 wins, boo that man.

# 8. Which young Grizzlies player will improve the most from last season?

[The closest one yet, SPJ edges it by 1 vote.](https://preview.redd.it/7ksvz7s1rqud1.png?width=600&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=70045e5ae87a26202b4e1d42b68304e01fa16830)

When I wrote this question I was about to add Ziaire in at the 6th spot, anyways I'm assuming the injuries to Vince and GG play a part in the results here and people believe that Jake has the opportunity to really cement himself as a key part of the rotation, I went for GG as I believe him having some of the scoring load taken off him can only mean more good things to come for his development.

# 9. How many games do you think Ja Morant will play?

[Mostly optimism around Ja's game time.](https://preview.redd.it/cb8p2zyrrqud1.png?width=600&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=753f232a47191af3bb8c680dd4d1631e52f66b18)

Not much to say here, just have to wait and see. Hopefully we are blessed with an injury free and no suspensions season.

# 10. How much do you trust the coaching staff?

[Mostly optimism here, only 4 voters answered with less than a 3.](https://preview.redd.it/d71w4jgesqud1.png?width=600&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=dea203a2d1e27627866aa68c3898b2be412bf444)

There was definitely some pressure on Jenkins from this subreddit after the shaky start to last season, but by the all star break it had died down as it was the season from hell.

# 11. How much do you trust the FO to make the necessary moves?

[Similar trajectory to the coaching question, although with more variance.](https://preview.redd.it/7leryb4rtqud1.png?width=600&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=865d5182e2a461a77073628631bf8260703ab052)

There seems to be a stronger opinion on Kleiman and co. I was surprised to see nearly half of voters giving less than a 4 here I guess some aren't happy with the supposed lack of front court depth.



# Some predictions I picked out:

- 8 predict Desmond Bane to be an all star with a couple all-NBA shouts.

-2 predict Jalen Johnson to make the all star game.

- 5 predict Smart will be traded by the deadline. 

- A handful of predictions that have one or two of JJJ/Bane getting season ending injuries. (boooooo)

- Nearly a dozen predict one or two of the Thunder/Knicks to underperform.

- A few predict Clarke to win 6MOTY or become an all star.



# Conclusion:

Thanks for reading this did take me longer than expected but its always fun to see what the consensus is on here, you are more than welcome to call me an idiot for anything I said in this thread.

GG and Vince didnt get hurt in team workouts. They were injured doing their own thing. Thats on them. Not the staff!

2024-09-30,1727704830,New Fan here joining the Grizz?,"Hey guys =K just a random guy from europe here who decided to follow the grizzlies next season and would love some guidance and help.

I narrowed it down to a few teams and choose the grizzlies to follow primarily because of Ja Morant. That guy is a living highlight reel and just too amazing to watch. I didnt see him live yet but I watched his clips and goddamn he is amazing. Do you guys think he matured after missing the beginning of last season because of the offfield issues? 

I kinda like ja (also the Ja1 were my first basketball shoes lol) but the offield stuff kinda bothered me. He is so good and I just hope he can focus on the basketball stuff and ball out next season.

Im exited for the new season and how edey will play. The Grizz are the gritty, defense minded and fun to watch team I look for. And following Ja will be very fun.

Bonus fun fact: As a diehard Baltimore Ravens fan i kinda had the grizzlies not on my list at the beginning of my Choosing a team process. As a Team from Tennessee i kinda had my opinions because of the titans. However I think the teams are kinda similar and I really love that the grizz are getting slept on and the whole Memphis v. Errbody vibe. It kinda matches with the ravens. Gonna be awesome once the Grizzlies wake up from their slumber.

So who are our main rivals? Lakers? Clipps? Goood fuk them and also fuk that alien kid from san antonio (although he plays damn good)

What are some common memes?

How is the vibe and chemistry of the team?

Do we have a good coach and front office? What about the owners?

Not a super important update or anything, but Verno is a trustworthy source. Sounds like the twisted ankle was a very minor injury that he would play through if these were real games, but why do so when these games are pointless.

2024-06-28,1719576622,I'm willing to believe Kleiman,"After watching both Vernon and Fastbreak talk about the Kleiman press conference, I think it's more likely than not that the night played out exactly how they had hoped. If true, they made a pretty ballsy gamble that they could hide interest in Edey for all of those weeks. 

I think they took important lessons from the Ziaire draft. They were clearly targeting either Wagner or definitely Giddey. OKC sent up every smokescreen they could and Kleiman had the rug pulled up from under him. Left to scramble and take ZW. 

This year, if I'm reading this correctly, he had intention to draft Edey all along. He said that Edey kinda ""let the cat out of the bag"" at combine. We also heard some rumblings about what a great fit Edey might be in OKC next to Chet and they certainly have the assets to move up if they had to. 

Well, now it's time to play the smokescreen game. In the past month plus, there has been no more certain thing in this draft than the Grizzlies wanting to trade up for Clingan. This draft is the ultimate crap shoot. Why the hell would a team make it so known that they valued a guy they might not get? Further to that, the other alternative is that they don't value any other big enough to stay at 9 so they would likely trade back. If you are OKC reading the tea leaves, Edey is as certain as Giddey was to the Grizzlies. 

Now comes draft day, and everyone is working the phones. The best outcome here is that they don't have to move up and still get their guy. They have to sell hard. They go so far as to have Ja follow Clingan on IG. As Clingan is sliding, they need to keep their appearance of desperation for him so they keep Charlotte on the line until the very last second. Now there are two morepicks to go and both Clingan and Edey are there. Down goes Clingan, and good luck to him. The work is done. If they have done their jobs perfectly, teams don't think Memphis values Edey enough to stay at 9 and won't have to jump them. It was a gamble, but one that like Kleiman said worked out exactly as they hoped. As a kicker, the team that pulled the rug out from under us with Giddey had the favor returned and were left picking a guy with a torn up knee. Best of luck to Topic too, but that pick seemed so uninspired.

Thanks you for indulging in my fantasy",memphisgrizzlies,48,https://www.reddit.com/r/memphisgrizzlies/comments/1dqi4wt/im_willing_to_believe_kleiman/

2024-04-10,1712763187,Let's talk about Scotty Pippen Jr.,"When we brought in Scotty, I admit I had pretty low expectations. I assumed he'd just be another warm body to keep us at the minimum player availability requirements.  That maybe he was only in the league because of his father.  That said, I have been absolutely wowed with his overall gameplay and performance with us this season.

**Stats this year:**

 * 18 Games Played
 * 24.2 minutes per game
 * 11.7 PTS per game
 * 3.1 REB per game
 * 4.4 AST per game
 * 1.7 STL per game
 * 0.6 BLK per game
 * 48/43/74 shooting splits

Obviously, whether or not he can maintain these stats with our full squad is yet to be determined.  With Derrick Rose's nagging injuries and seemingly inconsistent availability, what do you think about SPJ as the back-up PG of the future?  At this point, I feel like he deserves the opportunity as he's earned it.  His ability to create off the dribble, penetrate opposing defenses, and hit open shots could prove extremely valuable next season, but of course we'll have convert him from a two-way, requiring us to cut a guaranteed spot.  Guys like Yuta, Rose or even Ziaire could be the fall-guy.

So I have an irrational (maybe fully rational?) hatred of Chet Holmgren so naturally within seconds of us drafting Edey I immediately started fantasizing about Big Maple body checking Lil Chet into the stanchion and dunking it home for an easy two. I texted my friends about how fun it will be to watch Edey dominate Lil Chet, then it occurred to me that he'll also manhandle Lil Wemby and any of the other long and skinny bigs you often find on NBA rosters these days.

After watching him absolutely ragdoll Lil Walker on the game-tying putback, I realized that \*every\* opposing big is tiny compared to our thicc Canadian son. So, I humbly propose that you consider referring to opposing bigs as ""Lil + Name"" whenever you see fit.

They have shot 26/102 (25.4%) from 3PT.","Clearly this high volume 3 point shooting, despite shooting a league worst in 3PT%, is an intentional gameplan from the coaching staff. These shots aren't wide open, coming from fluid offense that leaves a man taking a good high quality shot. They are overwhelmingly contested early shot clock 3s or end of shot clock heaves.

After watching highlight reels from last season (I know not the best source), I came away with two things:

1. Solid defender with good rebound positioning and the ability to steal.

2. Smart with how he uses his energy... He *can* dunk, but opts for quick underhand layups nearly every time. I respect that he is smart about choosing when to use explosive energy and when to go with the old reliable.",memphisgrizzlies,20,https://www.reddit.com/r/memphisgrizzlies/comments/1g8w80m/john_jitty_konchar_first_impression/

Around a month ago I [made a video] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CqDz_l7xjdw&amp;t=195s) about Bane's growth offensively this past season. Given that he was the primary focus for opposing defenses, I'm not sure how many non-Grizzlies fans know how impressive he was. I was also interested to hear what others thought Bane could do this year as the 24-25 season approaches. Ja returning will be huge, but long term all those reps playing on the ball should go a long way and the team can trust him for stretches facilitating offense. If the West wasn't so deep at guard, I'd say an All-Star appearance is a possibility as well.",memphisgrizzlies,11,https://www.reddit.com/r/memphisgrizzlies/comments/1fi6pl1/desmond_bane_got_even_better_this_past_season/

2024-02-13,1707840369,My Personal Thoughts on the GG Punishment,"I know many were disappointed / worried when we found out about GG being inactive due to a violation of team rules. A friend of mine who is a fan of another team texted me saying ""GG is suspended??!?!?"" Which I guess is technically true but feels way more dramatic than what the situation actually is.

GG was still with the team pre-game last night, cheesing it up with everyone, posing for pictures for fans who had their phones held up toward him. He's also expected to be [back with the team for tomorrow's game against the Rockets](https://x.com/TheJonahDylan/status/1757187698438131870?s=20), so we can rest easy knowing that whatever it is, it isn't too crazy.

[GG previously admitted to being fined several times at the beginning of the season.](https://twitter.com/colinzcody/status/1755829232243007537?s=46) He unfortunately did not stay on his ""p's and q's"" for very long but hey, he's 19 and just became a millionaire.

While the situations are clearly very different as to their respective franchise ""stock"", I think we're seeing them react based on lessons that they learned from the other South Carolinian on the team.

We know that Ja partying before / after games was enough of an issue to where [Steven Adams tried to lead a player's only meeting](https://www.si.com/nba/2023/03/07/steven-adams-grizzlies-players-ja-morant-incident) to address it before that foggy-Denver-eve had even happened. One would have to assume that that started with several smaller infractions, probably similar to whatever GG has had a hard time with.

Forcing him to sit out of a game for something minor is pretty extreme, but better correct extremely now if it helps instill the importance of *really* staying on your p's and q's to Mr. Good Game Jackson.

Today I found out that Santi Aldama is also named after his father, Santiago Aldama, who was in the Spanish National Team in 1992 Olympics in Barcelona. (His dad is a 7 footer too)  


Therefore, we may have a chance of whole ""in the name of the father"" lineup during this season:

2024-01-06,1704546570,"Ja morant improved his 3 during the offseason, and its the best thing he could have done.","Although the first couple games of his return felt like live ja 3 point practice, probably because he was adapting to the flow of the game after missing a large amount of time, in the last 4 games hes shot 50%, 33%, 50%, and 42%. And this was on 6.5 3pa per game, so not even low volume.

There is no understanding how big a consistent 3 point shot will be for him if he keeps this up. when hes hitting them, his matchup cant block off his drives/ go and play help defense and people saying hes peaked will be proven wrong.

Furthermore, easy buckets from 3 let him put more effort in in general and reduce his injury risk. Which will be very helpful aswell because he often looks gassed when he has to take the vast majority of his points inside the arc.

2024-03-14,1710408593,Theory: We have the #1 pick in this years draft and were paying the cost.,"The Memphis Grizzlies' unexpectedly subpar season is at the center of an amusing, yet entirely ""factual,"" conspiracy theory. According to this theory, the natural order of the NBA was severely disrupted when the Grizzlies, defying all odds and expectations, secured GG Jackson, the forecasted #1 pick of the 2024 draft, at the astonishing position of 45th in the 2023 draft. This event, seemingly innocuous at first glance, actually caused a rift in the basketball continuum.

The NBA, a league that prides itself on balance and fairness, couldn't simply stand by and watch this anomaly unfold without consequence. Hence, a cosmic agreement was struck, not just with the NBA, but with the universe itself. This agreement dictated that the Grizzlies were to undergo a ""corrective season,"" a season so filled with inexplicable turnovers, bizarrely missed shots, and a string of unfortunate injuries that it could only be the result of a preordained tank, a tank of cosmic proportions.

This grand scheme was orchestrated to restore balance to the league, ensuring that the cosmic scales of basketball justice were balanced. The Grizzlies, having been granted a boon in the form of GG Jackson, now owed the basketball gods a season of sacrifice. It was as if the universe itself demanded a tank, a gesture to acknowledge that such gifts come at a price.

As a result, every misstep, every loss, and every bewildering play has been seen not as mere coincidence or a run of bad luck, but as part of a grander plan to repay the universe for the draft anomaly. This theory underscores a fundamental truth in the world of sports: sometimes, the greatest victories require the greatest sacrifices. And so, the Memphis Grizzlies' season has been nothing short of a cosmic ballet, played out on the hardwood, a reminder that in the great draft lottery of life, sometimes you have to lose to win.",memphisgrizzlies,14,https://www.reddit.com/r/memphisgrizzlies/comments/1beh6zx/theory_we_have_the_1_pick_in_this_years_draft_and/

So, that would leave us with a 2 way slot open. It seems to me that the front-runners for that are the guard Yuki Kawamura and the foward Mãozinha Pereira. Which one do you think should reveive the contract?  

I can see the argument for both sides. The two if them played well this pre season so far. Pereira is a strong rebound machine, shown to be able to hit shots at times, and is a solid defender. His addition would be great and he still has room to develop. You can also never have too much size. On ther other hand, Kawamura was beast on the olympics and is a true point guard who can run the offense like a top player. The problem with him is clear, tho. He is too short. And that's something you will never be able to change. They would both be good additions on the two-way deal, but I personally prefer Pereira.

If you go back in my comment history enough, you will find a metric ton of hate towards Edey about how he doesn't do anything, is unskilled, and is a foul merchant, mainly stemming from my favorite team losing to him in the tournament. But, putting my Vol fandom aside, he was the best pick available for our team. I'm 100% behind him now. All he has to do to be a plus player is to set screens, be a threat in the paint, and grab boards. That's the minimum, and I feel like his ceilling is much, much higher.

I'll always root for Knecht but Edey is our guy. A lot of Vol twitter guys are having a meltdown over the pick but they seem to not realize that a pro team is not obligated to draft their players despite being in the same state... 7 hours away. Of course., I have to mention that most of Memphis doesn't really support the Vols anyway. Same thing happened with Levis and Hooker in the NFL,  and I love Hooker but he seems like he will not accomplish anything in the league.

Oh well, it's a trial whatever, I'll watch the game tonight and cancel the trial tomorrow.

OK then I do have League Pass, so let me link my NBA ID with my YouTube TV account and I'll just catch the replay once it's all over and uploaded. Link my accounts, download the NBA app on Roku, and sign in with my NBA ID. OK, here we go, there's now a button to ""Watch Full Game"", let's click that.

AND IT F&amp;^%*$#@ asks me to purchase NBA League Pass??? I already did that... in fact, I already did it twice today if you count my 7-day trial. OK maybe I linked my account wrong, let me check out these account settings on the NBA App. Hmm.. yeah it says I'm linked to YouTube TV BUT THAT DOESN'T LET ME HAVE LEAGUE PASS THROUGH THE NBA APP.

2024-02-21,1708520052,John Hollinger's recent post in The Athletic on GG Jackson,"A one-and-done who was an afterthought in the draft after a rough year at South Carolina, GG Jackson II went 45th in the 2024 NBA Draft but has made an impression during the Grizzlies injury-ravaged season, earning his second TNT walk-off interview of the year on Thursday by scoring 27 points in an upset of the Milwaukee Bucks. The NBAs youngest player, Jackson turned 19 in December but posted three 20-point games in the eight days before the All-Star break. He hit a career-high six 3-pointers against the Bucks and is 18-of-36 from distance over his last five games, averaging 21.2 points per game in that span.

Jackson isnt shy about getting up shots. While not quite as thirsty as his fellow teenage rookie Cam Whitmore in Houston (profiled a week ago), he still averages more than 10 field goal attempts per assist and thus is depending heavily on accurate shooting to support his value. In that vein, how well Jacksons recent hot shooting carries forward will play a huge role in his eventual success. Jackson has made 41.2 percent of his 102 NBA 3-point attempts but has no prior history of shooting this well from distance. He only made 31.3 percent of his 160 3-point attempts in the G League, for instance, and 32.4 percent of his 170 attempts at South Carolina a season ago. He shot 32.6 percent on 46 tries in summer league. Hes young enough that its not wildly unreasonable to think he got better, but the sample size is small enough that it could just be random noise, and his shots still come off his hand spinning sideways.

The good news for Memphis is that Jackson doesnt have to shoot like Stephen Curry to have value. Jackson has a plus handle for his size, and hes big enough to score around the rim on offense, with the help of a nifty Euro step hes developed. He also provides value at the defensive end with secondary rim protection (3.3 percent block rate!) and solid rebounding. Thus, Jackson stands to have value even if hes just a meh 3-point shooter. As long as he can continue refining his game from the wildness of his season at South Carolina (38.4 percent field goal shooting with a minus-7 Pure Point Rating & yikes!), he should be able to stick as a two-way forward.

If so, he fills a very-important niche on the size-skill continuum for the Grizzlies, who have been searching for years for a skilled player in the 6-7 to 6-9 range who can straddle the two forward positions. Between Jacksons development and that of 2023 second-rounder Vince Williams Jr. the Grizzlies now have two wings with size on cost-controlled deals for the next three seasons (Memphis and Jackson recently agreed to convert his two-way contract to a four-year standard roster deal), making it much easier to absorb the expensive extensions of Ja Morant, Desmond Bane and Jaren Jackson Jr. while still fielding a competitive team.",memphisgrizzlies,17,https://www.reddit.com/r/memphisgrizzlies/comments/1awbcp4/john_hollingers_recent_post_in_the_athletic_on_gg/

2024-06-27,1719503586,Some Quotes on Edey,"**KOC at the Ringer on draft winners:** ""And by the way, Verno will fall in love soon. So will all Grizzlies fans. Edey is going from Braden Smith to Ja Morant as his point guard. Morant will create easier shots for him than hes ever had before. And hes going to be supported on defense with some stout perimeter defenders and a former Defensive Player of the Year in Jaren Jackson Jr. There wasnt a better fit for Edey in the entire draft than Memphis. I wasnt sure itd happen. The Grizzlies want to play fast. And they will. But it turns out they also want to be able to slow it down. And now with Edey, they will be able to play any way they want to, and both dictate matchups and respond to matchups in a playoff setting.""

**Jonathon Givony on the Lowe Post:** One of the most remarkable things about Zach Edey is he never came off the floor for Purdue. He would play 40 minutes consecutively and it didn't even look like look like he's breaking a sweat. His conditiong for a 7'5 guy is absolutely unreal...You hear him as high as Memphis at 9...There's not a more ready guy to play right now...unbelievable level of physicality and intensity on every possession...outstanding offensive rebounder off the bat...he's going to get you to the bonus like that, he's a foul magnet...probably the best screener in this draft...imagine if Jonas Valanciunas was 7'5...you have to account for him. If you throw the ball in the general vicinity of the basket he's going to catch it, he's got incredible hands, an amazing finisher, and he's just going to put a hurting on people every time he's on the court. People are going to hate playing against him. He's a pain in the ass because he doesn't have an off switch. All he wants to do is smash you the entire game. He's talked about this in interviews, he says, ""this is what I like doing guys, I like hitting people.""...I was around Boban, I took a bus with him on the way to Montenegro, Edey is very different from Boban, he's in a different stratosphere than Boban Marjanovic. 

**An incredible read from last year that shows Edey's personality:** [Zach Edey Is Just Different - The Ringer](https://www.theringer.com/platform/amp/2023/3/15/23640235/zach-edey-purdue-boilermakers) : But Edey is focused on the present. Back at practice, he turns his gaze to the court, entering a state of stillness. He looks calm, stoic, borderline detached, even. He doesnt hear anything. He tunes out in games this way, too; he doesnt hear the crowd, the refs, the music. Pure silence. Internally, though, hes the exact opposite. Hes burning; on the cusp of combustion. He doesnt think; he only sees *red*. Only turns his attention toward dominating his next opponent. I usually try to get myself angry, Edey says. Ill just find some reason."" He mostly thinks of how hes perceived: *Hes succeeding only because hes tall. Hes scoring only because hes big.* He thinks of how little he was recruited out of IMG Academy, back when he was ranked no. 436 in his high school class, [per 247Sports](https://247sports.com/player/zach-edey-46094742/). He thinks of how many suggested he redshirt his first year at Purdue; they predicted he would never find his way. *FUCK YOU.* *YOURE WRONG.* *ILL SHOW YOU.* Edey might literally be the biggest target in all of college hoops, and he receives an extraordinary amount of vitriol from opposing fan bases each game. He leans into it, though, using it as fuel during practice and games. His lock screen features lyrics from the Game and 50 Cents Hate It or Love It. He often thinks of how even the compliments he receives feel somewhat conditional. I *guess* hes athletic, for a 7-footer. More red, more ammunition. More f-bombs. *ILL SHOW YOU AGAIN. ILL KEEP SHOWING YOU HOW WRONG YOU ARE...*His anger, though, is controlled. He doesnt get emotional or step out of his teams offense. Hes averaging only 1.7 fouls per game, a career low. Hes always been able to harness his fire to his advantage. And the competitive drive he has had since he was a child, back when he got irked when his hockey teammates didnt touch the line during sprints, explodes into something beautiful. Unstoppable. Hes averaging 22.3 points and 12.8 rebounds on 61 percent shooting from the field. I play better when Im pissed off, Edey says. Edeys ability to find that dark place where he sees red comes from his childhood. Growing up, he struggled to fit in and feel comfortable in his own skin, given his size. He used to put on his headphones and look at his phone while walking because he knew the second he looked up, hed see people staring at him and hear cruel comments.As a teenager, he says, youre already a little insecure. & For me, to almost *know* that a lot of people are just talking about me, especially when I walk by strangers, it was really, really hard on me.",memphisgrizzlies,13,https://www.reddit.com/r/memphisgrizzlies/comments/1dpumo2/some_quotes_on_edey/

2024-09-18,1726688785,Die hard Purdue fan here and Im rooting for yall hard this season.,"Im not really a big NBA guy, but have watched Purdue players when they get in the mix. 
That being said Im all in on Memphis this year. Edey has been hated on and discredited his entire career, and I couldnt be happier that he ended up in Memphis. I have watched every single game (some multiple times) and truly believe he is going to be a big success with you guys. Just a couple of thoughts Ive had reading comments surrounding him.
-Edey had to play 30+ minutes last year in a half court driven league getting double and tripled teamed on every possession, and getting about half the fouls he could have gotten. He had to be big and durable. Hes dropped a few pounds, but I wouldnt worry about him losing any presence inside. He is still massive (obviously), and his best attributes are his positioning and off-ball work. 
-He is going to have enough of a shot to keep defenses honest.
-Im most curious to see how much he can develop as a passer. He got a lot quicker in his decision making at Purdue, but still has a long way to go.
-Defensively I hope he reigns in it a bit from what I saw in the summer league. Hes going from being told to never foul to go out there and block shots. While he naturally gets his hands on the ball when defending, I thought in summer league he was pushing a bit too hard, which lead to the ankle rolls.
-How much will they feed him inside if he continues to burry his man under the basket?

The inspiration for this topic originated during last year's off-season, aiming for a more comprehensive overall understanding of all league players. I personally wrote 370 review articles covering all players who played over 500 minutes, each rated individually.

Last year's NBA 400 Project garnered over 27 million reads and 24,000 likes/comments/shares on my [Chinese social media account](https://weibo.com/u/6748483996) (Weibo), which boosted my confidence tremendously. In June this year, I started the update of '**NBA 400 Project · 2024**', which is nearing completion. Unlike last year, this year I invited over **60** guests to participate, most of them are die-hard fans of a particular team, providing narratives much deeper than mine. This year's 'NBA 400 Project' has nearly reached 20 million reads in less than two months, with likes/comments/shares already at 29,000.

As a Grizzlies fan, I completed the writing for the Grizzlies players. Starting today, I will gradually bring the content here. Looking forward to interacting with friends in Grizz Nation.

2024-04-10,1712789808,I am so hype for grizzlies basketball next year,"The grizzlies are going to be in one of the better driving seats in terms of contention if kleiman handles this off-season right.

Their depth is going to be genuinely crazy.

If they approach free agency and sign a guy like Taurean Prince (which I can genuinely see them doing), and trading for a very talented center (which they have the assets for) their 15 man roster could be:

Ja Morant-Marcus smart-Scottie Pippen Jr
Desmond Bane-Luke Kennard-John Konchar
Vince Williams-GG Jackson-Taurean Prince
Jaren Jackson Jr-Santi Aldama-Lamar Stevens
Center via trade/FA-Brandon Clarke-Trey Jemison 

that third string lineup is better than many teams BENCHES. They have every single tool needed to contend.
They have an MVP caliber player in Ja Morant, two all nba/all star caliber guys in Desmond Bane and Jaren Jackson Jr, they have scoring off the bench with their entire backup unit, they have several high quality role players in guys like GG, Vince, smart, Kennard, Clarke, etc. They have elite perimeter defenders in guys like Vince and smart, with GOOD perimeter defenders in guys like bane, pippen, and Lamar stevens. Not to mention the amount of spacing their gonna have with guys like GG, Luke, pippen, Santi, Vince, (and obviously bane), and Taurean Prince (if that happens).

If they can end up getting a center who can atleast somewhat replicate Adams impact in terms of being a defensive ANCHOR, that brings back DPOY jaren. Grizzlies basketball is so back next season. Plus guys like aldama and clarke who each have pretty good trade value could be moved for even better pieces (not that I condone that lol) all while kleiman still has an array of picks to use in trades

Idk why tf we let him go. Hes a 71 center who can block shots, hit threes, stretch the floor, and capitalize on lobs.

2024-01-22,1705889953,Positives from this season,"I just wanted to remind yall of some of the good things to happen this season, as it's been rough recently and i think we could use something to be glad about during these dark days. apologies in advance if any of my information is inacurate.

\- New career highs in points from Vince (24), Santi (28), Jaren (44), &amp; Bane (49, second most in grizzlies history)

\- GG Jackson became the third youngest player in NBA history to have back to back 20 point games, i think you know who the other two players are

\- Bane also had two double doubles this season (prior to this he had 1), which includes a game where he got a new career high in assists (13) alongside 24 points and 5 rebounds, putting his improved playmaking on display

\- Ja set the record for most points after missing 25+ games in a row with 34, also making an amazing game-winning buzzer beater

\- Marcus smart started shooting like crazy just before his injury (he had 3 games in a row with 4+3pm and 23+pts before he realised his finger was messed up)

\- Vince evolved and became a full-time NBA player, also getting stat lines like 17pts/8ast/8reb, 15pts/9reb/2blk, sometimes off the bench

\-On multiple occasions (i think) we came back from 20+ point leads to end up winning the game

\-We've had some nasty posters too (including, ja's dunk on wemby, d-rod's dunk on josh green, jaren's dunk on rudy, &amp; biz's dunk on turner)

\-BC is starting to dunk again and is coming back at possibly the all star break

this season has sucked so hopefully reminding you of the positives will help in making it a tad bit less awful.

2023-12-20,1703085061,THEORY: Has a 365-Day-Long Curse from the Basketball Gods Finally Ended,"The past year of Memphis Grizzlies Basketball has been pretty frustrating, as we're all well aware. But I was thinking about where it all started [and I have a theory](https://i.imgflip.com/1itoun.jpg).

The 12/15 loss against the rockets was rough. The former heart-and-soul-of-the-team, Dillon Brooks, came back home and hit the game clincher on our floor. Nevermind the fact that we'd officially lost the season series against an opponent that would be nice to have the tiebreaker against for play-in standings.

But - to rewind a bit, does anyone happen to remember what happened exactly 365 days before this, on 12/15/2022? I'll give you a second to think about it. Well, this is a text post so I guess you can just stop scrolling if you want to try to guess.

[12/15/2022](https://www.espn.com/nba/game/_/gameId/401468580)

We blew out the best team in basketball in truly dominant fashion. I think the grave sin that we committed was when mid-game the crowd got bored and started to do the wave (for an extended period of time)

[and the players joined in](https://youtu.be/7CWSx-PHeDw?si=iVXGcY5-cvt09c30&amp;t=84)

None of us are blameless. The players, and fanbase alike, tempted the basketball gods. This was the first domino to fall in a truly horrific sequence of events. Injuries, Inadequate performances, and Instagram lives.

Now we await Ja's Home debut against the pacers - the most anticipated game at the FedEx Forum in a long time. Maybe the most anticipated regular season game ever? The Date?

12/21/2023

You're not going to believe this. I had to delete my original post and repost this because I realized this after I had already finished it just about the 12/15 events. Does anyone happen to remember what was said 365 days prior, on 12/21/2022?

[\*'\* \*\*\*\* \*\* \*\*\* \*\*\*\*](https://x.com/complexsports/status/1605675714560286744?s=46&amp;t=mjwUkdriZzZV-yawefDZRQ)

Hopefully this year of hell will suffice as enough retribution from the basketball gods. I humbly ask that the wave becomes a prohibited act within the FedEx Forum and to keep Malika Andrews away from this team at all costs! I can't go through another year of this.

2023-11-20,1700494308,[Bobby Manning] Santi Aldama told me Marcus Smart talked to the #Grizzlies for 10 straight minutes pregame about tips for facing the #Celtics,"Hope Im not breaking any rules by posting  this here! Someone linked it in the Celtics sub last night and thought you guys might want to see it.

I consistently said that one of the most underrated things about Smart (and the main reason I thought he deserved dpoy) is his defensive playmaking. On the floor, hed be calling out opposing plays and directing guys where they needed to be. But even when off court, hed be coaching guys up on both defense generally and on specific player/team tendencies.

Was very impressed by all the guys who stepped up for the Grizzlies, Santi being one of the biggest examples.

Tomorrow is my first day back at work, and this will be the first game of the season I will not be able to watch live.

2023-11-04,1699074369,This sucks.,"That's it. That's the post.

Kidding. But also not.

Adams ain't walking through that door. The latest updates on Clarke give me the feeling that he'll be out for the entire year, although it's not as if he was expected to move the needle for the overall season. Rose is already banged up and re-confirming he needs short spurts and uber rest. Ziaire is a breath of fresh air, but none of the other young'ens look to have taken a step forward. At all.

And, now, 0-6. 

Yeah, yeah, it's along season, they lost 5 straight and 8/9 last year, but....this is grim.

The roster's flawed for the year due to all the frontcourt injuries. Even the In-Season Tourney - which I LOVE and am legit excited about - looks lost after losing to the supposedly weakest team in the pool.

**How have or haven't your expectations changed since the beginning of the season?** What're the bright spots and reasons for ""hope?""

The Lakers made it to the playoffs just last season after starting 0-5, so we couldn't just repeat that.

2023-12-27,1703714053,Bane Season Stats So Far,"Desmond Bane is 3rd right now in PPG (25.2) for all Shooting Guards in the NBA. How do we feel based on expectations coming into the season? He is currently tied with Anthony Edwards in PPG on better percentages across the board, the same number of assists per game, same number of stocks per game, and less turnovers. Many thought Ja coming back would cause his PPG to fall off, but so far Des has 29 PPG in games Ja has played this season. Maybe Dillon being gone and a higher standing in terms of team leadership for Bane could see him thrive alongside Ja counting stats wise. I certainly think his shooting percentages will increase with the defenses focusing in on Ja and the paint. Just posting cuz I thought its crazy Bane is sitting 3rd overall at his position and is only 2 PPG back from the top 2 (Spida and Booker). Des has to be one of the most slept on players in the league. Doubt he even gets an All-Star spot despite his impressive stats this season.

Ive been to plenty of games and have never come across another fan like that. Constantly yelling at the top of his lungs f**k the Grizz and f**k Marc Gasol. He was genuinely trying to fight anyone that was asking him to pipe down and relax. Families, including myself, had to relocate to a different section he was so horrible which left him out on an island by himself. There were multiple efforts to have security escort him out but they didnt do anything but tell him to be quiet, which made him more agitated and led to more screaming WHO TF SNITCHED ON ME?! IMMA WHOOP YO ASS. 

You can be passionate about and root for your team. But when your team is playing away and youre screaming obscenities about the home team around other fans, thats a huge no go. You just made an embarrassment out of yourself and fan base. So yes I am absolutely thrilled that the 76ers lost and hes probably at home right now still crying.

2023-11-02,1698897339,Every team in the NBA is off to a worse start to the 2023-24 NBA season than us. Here's why:,"I've been sensing a lot of doom and gloom around here lately. I guess a zero and five start to the NBA season has people in their feelings. I'm here to tell you it is okay! Sure we aren't off to a great start, but The Grizzlies are actually in a better spot than every other team in the league right now. Heres why:

**Atlanta Hawks:** 

The Two and Two Hawks are off to a shaky start. Sure, they beat the Bucks thanks to an all time stinker of a performance from Dame, they have also lost to the Hornets! It looks like the Hawks will be doomed to mediocrity this year with Trae Young dragging them to the play-in. This bodes poorly for a team missing a lot of future firsts! With their first round pick this year still in their possession, they will need to blow up the team quickly to secure a young guard to build around. 

**Boston Celtics**

The Celtics are off to a 4-0 start, but we all know this wont last. Sooner or later, they WILL lose a game, and if you dont win every single game you play, is there really a point playing at all? The Knicks and Heat are push overs in the regular season, and the Wizards? Well, a team led by Jordan Poole and Kyle Kuzma will struggle to beat *anyone.* The Celtics are likely to blunder their way into a top seed in the east, and then fall over spectacularly in the playoffs when they forget how to dribble, drive and hit lay-ups, all essential skills in basketball. Then Jrue Holliday will retire and theyll be back to square one. Still, they have their picks. Now might be the time to blow it up and find a generational forward who can give you 30 a game to build around, before they squander another season with a finals appearance. 

**Brooklyn Nets**

The Nets have once again failed to go 0-82, foolishly beating the Hornets. Theyre on track to win only 33% of their games. Given they owe their pick this year, and will be getting a measley first round pick from the super team suns, theyre missing the draft capital to rebuild this disastrous roster. It looks like it is time to deal Mikal Bridges (I hear he is worth at least three firsts!) and rebuild.

**Charlotte Hornets**

Good god what is happening in Charlotte? 

**Chicago Bulls**

The vultures are circling the bulls. *Caw Caruso Caw!* They say, with surprisingly raven like voices. *Caw LaVine would be good on the knicks Caw!* Another middling start for a middling team that has underperformed expectations time and time again. Sure they beat the raptors, but they followed it up with a loss to the pistons. For the sanity of all fans involved. It is time to trade them. Start afresh. Develop Lauri properly next time.

**Cleveland Cavaliers**

The Cavs have fallen off a cliff since they were embarrassed by the Knicks in the playoffs. Winning a mere 25% of their games this season. With Donovan Mitchell looking around for the exit and their star Darius Garland sidelined with a knee injury, along with Jarrett Allen, who is left on the Cavs to lead them? Emoni Bates and Tristan Thompson? Time to hand the keys to Mobley and rebuild. 

**Dallas Mavericks**

Dallas and Luka are off to a 4-0 start. You know who else got off to a 4-0 start? Hitler, probably. Is Luka Hitler? You be the judge, but I sure as hell wouldnt want to be compared to Hitler. 

**Denver Nuggets**

[Awoo](https://www.reddit.com/r/timberwolves/comments/t7rydg/urswany_awoo/)

**Detroit Pistons**

Cade will need more help than a guy who tried to fight LeBron, Mr Double Jump, the worst player in the NBA, and budget Ja if they stand a chance of making the play-in. With four long years at the bottom of the east, and no light at the end of the tunnel, Piston fans will be asking themselves, how much worse can this get?"" and ""Why the fuck are you bringing us into this?"" Their hopes now rest entirely on those dastardly little ping pong balls.

**Golden State Warriors**

The Oakland Retirement village is one influenza outbreak away from starting Brandin Podziemski (who?), Lester Quinones (you know, Lester Quinones!), and Jerome Robinson (yes! That Jerome Robinson).

**Houston Rockets**

The Rockets have lost every game this year and dont look like ever winning. With (Im sorry HOW MUCH?!) still owed to Fred Van Vleet, and the development of their young draft picks stalling, looks like it is time to blow it up and build around ^engün before he turns 22 and cant be included in best young core under 22 lists.

Oh fuck they beat the Hornets.

**Indiana Pacers**

After getting off to a blistering two wins in a row, they have fallen off a cliff, losing EVERY. SINGLE. GAME. THEY HAVE EVER PLAYED. SINCE THEN. Reggie Miller must be rolling in his grave to see the once mighty pacers who inexplicably still have Myles Turner, languishing so much. 

**Los Angeles Clippers**

Well well well. How the turntables. After years of disappointment, the Clippers have bet their second farm on James Harden, who has just antiworked his away out of three teams, helping them overcome their mortal enemy: injuries. Maybe Harden knows a good doctor? 

**Los Angeles Lakers**

It seems father time has finally caught up to the Lakers aging star Austin Reaves. The 35 year old is two steps slow, and the lakers are feeling it. The only question that remains? How long will Anthony Davis last before his body gives out once more. If I were them, Id be looking to trade their allstar forward James, and rebuild. 

**Memphis Grizzlies**

With picks a plenty, two former defensive players of the year under 30, and an all-star backcourt, everything is going right for the Memphis Grizzlies. Just five games back from the 1st seed, with 73 games left in the season, playoff experience, and a wide open western conference, the Grizzlies are primed and ready for a deep playoff run. 

**Miami Heat**

The worst team in the worst conference in the NBA. You know what that means? Theyre the worst team in the NBA. Science. With a 34 year old Jimmy looking 34, and their best player Tyler Herro, being little more than trade bait for whichever star the Heat dont want to go all in on, it seems Heat culture may be flickering out. 

**Milwaukee Bucks**

Weve had a taste of the walking top 5 offence the Bucks just traded for, and so far, it seems it is less filet mignon, and more carrot thats been sitting at the back of your fridge way too long. How many more triple singles will we get from the All-NBA talent that set Miami on fire? Time will tell. (But its lots.) Somebody get Giannis some help. 

**Minnesota Timberwolves**

Who woulda thought the Wolves best center would not be Kat, not be Gobert, but Naz Reid? Naz Reid perhaps. Too bad Kyle has lost his 3 ball again. It is nice while it lasts. Id tell the wolves it is time to sell up and rebuild around Mr Edwards, but I forgot they gave away all their picks and Walker Kessler already. Hang in there boys. 

**New Orleans Pelicans**

How come Ja gets banned for waving a gun around like a dumbass, but Zion doesnt get banned for waving his dick around like a dumbass? Nothing further your honour. 

**New York Knicks**

I dont really think about the Knicks. 

**Oklahoma City Thunder** 

Shai, Chet, Giddey? Not exactly a lot of fire power. With only a few dozen picks, the thunder dont have a way forward. Unless theyd like to develop young players and have assets to make a trade. 

**Orlando Magic**

Every minute basketball terrorist Mo Wagner plays is a horror for the NBA. 

**Philadelphia Sixers**

Gonna be honest, I think trading James Harden for some old, tired, power forwards, when youve got prime Embiid, isnt ideal. Maybe Daryl knows what hes doing. Maybe he sits on a throne of lies.

**Phoenix Suns**

The supposed super team Phoenix Suns were supposed to be the team to beat this year. Instead, theyre the team beat, barely managing to win half their games, collapsing against the young spurs in embarrassing fashion. With high value assets such as Kevin Durant, Bradley Beal, and Devin Booker, it is time for the team to blow it up and get some value back before they limp to the play-in. 

**Portland Trail Blazers**

Dames loyalty finally reached its limit. After many years of putting up with poorly constructed rosters, he finally asked to join a decent one. In his place? Looks like Scoot Henderson is a bust unfortunately, you can tell after 4 games. Brodgon is somehow 31. Robert Williams is barely playing. Theyve got grant still for some reason& Strange place Portland. Maybe they should make a show about how strange they are. 

**San Antonio Spurs**

The spurs are led by their French prospect, with a high ceiling and a last name so complex I cant spell it. With comparisons to Bol Bol made by some of the greatest to ever play the game, a broken three ball, it seems the young Frenchman has bust written all over him. The spurs just barely snuck past the rockets and suns, so they basically just suck, but that means look on track to be a play-in team, completely ruining their chances of drafting more French centers. They will need to blow it up now before their picks are worthless and they need to draft Amer*cans.

**Toronto Raptors**

See Chicago bulls. Raven noises. 

**Utah Jazz**

The Jazz just spoiled a perfectly good tank job with a win against the Grizzlies. Now sitting at a 40% win loss record, thatll be good for neither the playin, nor the lottery. A wasted season with a star not getting any younger. Yes I know nobody gets younger, shut it.

2023-12-18,1702863215,Steven Adams is so much more to this team than anyone is talking about,"(\*\*\*Ok so I recently set up a reddit because I got off twitter years ago but I decided I wanted to start re-engaging in discourse with folks with similar interest. But I definitely wasn't going back to twitter lol. So Reddit it is. I clarify that because the point I am about to make may have been made on this platform plenty of times before, and if so I apologize. I just felt the need to make this comment because I feel like this isn't talked about too often)

So. Obviously nobody is denying SA is important to this team. He was the starting center, of course he mattered. And nobody was acting like it was no big deal that he went down (this season or last). But I don't think it has been emphasized enough just how crucial he is to our DNA as a team.

Here's what I mean.

SA is a different kind of big man than what we typically find in the NBA these days. There are guys like Sabonis, Joker and Joel that will get buckets and run an offense. There are guys like Kessler, JV, Brook Lopez, and nurkic that will be big, clear space and get boards. There are guys like JJJ, Robert Griffin, myles turner, and (maybe) looney that are seen as more ""athletic"" and mobile bigs.

SA does not fit in any of those categories really. He is a straight up work horse who happens to be big and strong. By that I mean he is a guy who knows how to do his job, and does his job to the best of his ability. He seeks no attention, no personal glory, he grinds, gets boards and clean up buckets, sets the hardest screens in the league, and facilitates to put his guys in position to score.

Here's why that matters so much for this team in particular

The thriving Griz of last season were absolutely spearheaded by the superstar leap (metaphorically and physically) of Ja. Thats no secret. But, one of the more interesting storylines of the season was the solid record we had WITHOUT Ja. Make no mistake, Ja's energy and confidence is absolutely what lead to the success of the rest of the team - he brought the best out of them. But I firmly believe (and I think this was proven by the back end of the season last year, post SA's injury) that SA was the steady force, the glue, the constant presence that allowed the rest of the team to play the ball that worked and highlighted their ability. In the ""train"" that is the Memphis Grizzlies, he was the man in the engine shoveling coal and keeping it moving.

What we learned with the young, confident, ""duck no smoke"" grizzlies of last year was that we had a bunch of really good ball players. A whole bunch of guys really shined and are playing some really good ball on other teams now as a result of showing out with us last year. SA was what allowed that to happen.

Now, its no secret that the ""do the job to the best of your ability"" kind of guys are always valuable to a team. PJ Tucker, Pat Bev, Dante Divincenzo, TJ McConnel, Jae Crowder, Al Horford, guys like that are always appreciated on a roster. But SA in particular just happened to be the PERFECT fit for our roster in particular. One of the most fun things about this team during our rise last year was that anyone could pop off any night. Ja would always get his of course. But beyond that we saw a bunch of guys rise to the occasion and that was a ton of fun. You had guys like Slow Mo, Brandon Clarke, Deanthony Melton, Tillman, and Tyus (when ja was out), have some really outstanding games, not to mention the rise of jjj and Desmond.

To have that many guys on a roster who are capable of going off for 25+ can make for a dynamic that does not exactly mesh. Thats where SA comes in. Again, any ""glue guy"" is valued. We just happened to have a glue guy who's skillset was the ""yin"" to the rest of the teams ""yang"". When you have a big man who cleans up the boards for a high volume shooting team (and he absolutely did - led the league in offensive boards) sets the best screens in the league for a myriad of slashers, and does the ""boring"" big man stuff so that guys like JJJ can lead the league in blocks and be in position to win DPOY, you have the heartbeat of your team. His floor clearing via screens and box outs allowed for the rest of the team to have the freedom to play the ball that worked for them. Time after time I would witness SA putting himself in position on the floor to make an opportunity open up for the other guys on his team.

He not only had a steady and consistent game that allowed for the fast paced, high flying Griz we love, he also had the steady and consistent attitude that seemed to help keep everything in check. I don't have as many direct instances I can point to for that assertion (other than when he picked up Tony Bradly like a little boy lol), but it is worth noting that the team vibes appeared to go down hill toward the end of the season where he was no longer a constant presence on the floor.

I feel the need to comment on this because its shocking to me that more people haven't talked about this from what I have seen. Again, maybe I am not looking in the right places, or maybe this has been regularly discussed on here. But to me this seems like such an obvious thing that nobody talks much about.

I don't want to say this season is a wash yet, because of course we gotta see what happens when Ja comes back to this new roster. Who knows, they could develop a new team identity and find a solid chemistry with who they have currently. And I very much hope that happens. But I just felt like this point was worth making. SA's departure last season was overlooked due to Ja's drama. But he mattered so much more to that team than anyone seemed to mention.

Go Griz, thank you for coming to my Ted Talk

2024-01-19,1705628214,Had a great time at the warriors game,"Tldr had a good time at the Grizz v warriors game.

Just wanted to share my great experience. My friends and I drove to Memphis from Nashville during MLK weekend. We had some great BBQ at Elwood's and pulled up to the game. The upper bowl was almost completely empty probably due to the weather so they let us in the lower, around 10 rows away from the court, I guess cause they wanted a better atmosphere or sum. 

During warmups my friend said they let a fan on the court and he was making all his 3s. But I looked over and it was just Luke Kennard. The same friend asked me how likely we were to win and I said honestly 10%.

We had a great time booing Draymond and he even smiled at us in response. There was a weird fan behind us who kept yelling and hating on Zaire, which is weird because I think it's better to show support for your guys even if they suck. But other than that everyone was really cool and the atmosphere was great. My group narrowly missed getting t shirts from the parachutes and cannons which was exciting. 

In the fourth, Gilyard hit a deep 3 to take the lead. My friend turned to me and sarcastically asked ""10%?"". I had to explain that I wasn't trolling him and it was legitimately 10%.

Shortly after, he got a notification that said classes were cancelled tmrw and at the same exact time, Kennard hit a dagger and everyone stood up and clapped as if congratulating us for gaining an extra day of rest.

Overall it was one of the best nights I remember having and I'll never forget the day the Memphis Hustle beat the Warriors and a potential star was born.

I guess to me it was bigger than sports because it was more like proof that even if you face difficult challenges, you can grit and grind your way to success.

Idk maybe it's stupid but I just found that game somehow inspirational and emotional and wanted to share.",memphisgrizzlies,8,https://www.reddit.com/r/memphisgrizzlies/comments/19a73g5/had_a_great_time_at_the_warriors_game/

2024-05-23,1716474914,Grizzlies aura is unmatched.,"Hey everyone, Timberwolves fan here. I know I don't belong in this sub, but I wanted to drop by and share my appreciation for the Grizzlies. If this post gets removed, I understand. Even though the Timberwolves and Grizzlies are kind of rivals, especially after yall beat us in the playoffs two years ago, I can't help but secretly admire the Grizzlies. I have a lot of love for the people of Memphis and the team. Ja Morant is my favorite player in the league (even more than Ant). Im captivated by Ja Morant's aura. We traded for Mike Conley and signed Kyle Anderson a couple of years ago, and they have been fantastic additions. That 2022 playoff series was the first one I got to enjoy as a Wolves fan in a long time (not counting the Jimmy Butler era). Ja Morant and Ant represent the future of the league. The Grizzlies are going to be incredibly good next season. I hope the Wolves get to face the Grizzlies in the playoffs more often because that series was so much fun. Good luck next year and cheers <{ ",memphisgrizzlies,22,https://www.reddit.com/r/memphisgrizzlies/comments/1cyuai0/grizzlies_aura_is_unmatched/

On average, opponents have a 29-12 Free Throws advantage per game. Memphis outscored their opponent in the paint in 3/4 games","The Memphis-Utah game is well-documented because it a game in which JJJ was ejected rapidly for protesting foul calls.

Suns defeat Grizzlies 110-89

* Suns have a 28-10 FTA advantage this game.
* Grizzlies have a 48-42 Points in the paint advantage.

Lakers defeat Grizzlies 134-107

* Lakers have a 24-12 FTA advantage this game.

Jazz defeat Grizzlies 127-121

* Jazz have a 29-13 FTA advantage this game.
* Grizzlies have a 48-44 Points in the paint advantage

Normally, you could explain this away as a feature of Memphis shooting too many threes, and not being in the paint enough, but Memphis outscored their opponents in the paint in 3/4 games.

2024-06-27,1719469896,"""I think having a big like JJJ on both ends of the floor helps optimize Zach, and I think Zach helps optimize us."" --Kleiman on Edey, With Interview Run-down","Folks, before you fully form your opinions on the matter of drafting Edey, [it's worth getting the GM's opinion and reasoning.](https://youtu.be/FAyaPCKIGlc)

But watching a 15 minute video feels impossible, right? Give me 15 second shorts! That's cool. I got a rapid fire run down of the interview, with direct quotes and timestamps if something catches your fancy. If there's not quotes around it, I'm paraphrasing. Brackets mean it's all me.

&gt;What was it about Edey that makes him a fit?

He's special. ""Care Factor."" 0:46 [I swear no Kleiman interview is complete without a Care Factor mention] Wants to win and improves every year. ""Could not be more thrilled to have landed him in this draft."" 1:10

&gt;Did you try to move up? Charlotte?

""Let's just say that this is exactly what we were hoping would happen tonight."" 1:32 ['Nuff said, I guess!]

&gt;Can he guard in space?

He's a polarizing player. I think there are some misconceptions about his defense. He was told not to foul out of games and his foul rate shows that. For us we'll let him be more aggressive, and he'll be with Jaren. ""Edey is the anchor in drop coverage."" 3:24 Also he's a great rebounder.

""In our frontcourt now, there's a lot of different ways we can play"" 3:52 [This is a crucial part of the interview imo, I think Kleiman is obsessed with finding a big combination that can fluidly change throughout a game.]

Jaren and Clarke is a great pairing, dynamic and athletic. ""We're optimistic about what the Zach Edey Jaren pairing is going to be"" 4:10 Jaren + Santi = Spacing

Basically, people spend a lot of time thinking, how do we match up against them? But Zach helps you because, ""you gotta deal with him... let them figure out how to deal with *us""* 4:43 Having ""different looks we can throw out over the course of a game or over the course of a series"" is important.

&gt;[Spice Alert] Zach (Edey) talked in the combine about talking with you quite a bit and liking Memphis, how early did you target him?

""Zach let the cat out of the bag-- we knew him from the year before."" 5:30 We talked with him a lot last year before he withdrew, but we had not spoken with him when he said that this year. [Sounds to me like Kleiman didn't appreciate his interest being broadcasted, haha]

&gt;We saw him get the call and it was emotional, what was that like?

It helped that we had talked in the past, but there was a lot of mutual excitement for him joining the Grizzlies.

&gt;[Reporter reaching for headline] Didn't you try to move up for Clingan?

Kleiman: ""I haven't seen that reported anywhere."" 6:35 Reporter: ""I'm asking."" Kleiman: ""I'm saying this is how we wanted the draft to play out tonight.""

&gt;Edey posted up a TON. Jenkins likes his Centers at the top of the key and the elbows. How do you see him fitting?

Zach was incredibly successful in the post in college, and that'll be a weapon. He's a screen setter, offensive rebounder, roll threat for Ja; we're excited about the pairing with Ja. Also the free throw shooting may mean shooting could be a part of his game, there's potential.

&gt;Luke Kennard?

He's a great fit for us, can't say more now.

&gt;Will Edey play Team Canada or Summer League?

We haven't discussed it yet.

&gt;Edey was healthy in college, but how about over 82 games? 

Zach's durability is remarkable. We'll get him in and get to know him, and it's not a place we're concerned.

&gt;Only a few people have won multiple Naismith Awards before the NBA, guys like Oscar Robinson, Pistol Pete [Maravich], do you think Edey can continue the tradition of becoming Hall of Famers like them? What can he do right away?

[Visible 'dude why are you asking that' vibes] Yeah I can't say what his career will look like, but ""we think he's a meaningful, impactful part of our group who can help us achieve high end team outcomes."" 10:15 which bleeds into the best quote of the interview...

""I think having a big like Jaren Jackson Jr on both ends of the floor helps optimize Zach, and I think Zach helps optimize us.""

&gt;He's had all these accolades in college but has been counted out, do you think he'll fit in with GG and Ja in that? Why's he a good fit?

He's so competitive, no nonsense. Track record of improvement and winning at a high level. I can't wait for people to get to know him.

&gt;Two picks left! What's gonna happen?

We'll see, it'll be interesting. We set a whole board up ahead of time and are excited, there are still good players available.

&gt;Lots of Grizz players commenting on social media, seeming excited. Any conversations with them?

I'll let them speak for themselves, but we're excited.

&gt;Not gonna mention Steven Adams [but yeah] but Ja works well with that kinda big, what do you see with that combo?

2024-01-29,1706517145,"Pacer fan here, I come in peace","Holy hell your team is like playing a buzz saw.  As many players as you guys were down today it took everything we had to barely escape with a victory.

Nothing but respect for your coach and the entire team.  I'm thrilled you guys play out west.

G G Jackson is one hell of a pickup at the 45th spot, he easily could be a starter on a lot of teams and he may one day be yours as well.

JJJ has obviously been hitting the weights, we don't have a single player on our team to match up with him physically.  Smith is the closest and he's not really even close.

Great game fella's I know this year has been rough for you but damned if you don't have a bright and shiny future.",memphisgrizzlies,14,https://www.reddit.com/r/memphisgrizzlies/comments/1adqkgw/pacer_fan_here_i_come_in_peace/

Having career highs in points, minutes, 3 40+ point games and being a leader for a team that has had a record number of guys in uniform, Jaren has earned his respect in my eyes more than ever. Yes he still fouls like an idiot sometimes and yes he could rebound more for a guy his size but without him this team would be even further away from bouncing back to contender status next season.
