2023-12-04,1701703287,Finch: Rudy on a mission to win a Championship,"Listening to Paul Allen right now on KFAN and Finch is on talking about the team and is dropping a lot of good nuggets. Says Rudy came into the season more locked in than any player hes ever been around and is on a mission to prove to the league, prove to the fans, that the trade was worth it and hes dialed in to win a Championship. 

Also said the league is more wide open than ever and it has a lot of guys energized around the NBA. 

Another thing he said which I thought was interesting is that the Wolves have blackout days where they do not allow players into the facility (unless they need treatment) specifically to protect them against themselves and give them time to rest.

To first start by rolling 4-0 through a superteam (superteam) that beat the shit out of the Timberwolves all season and that many people thought they would lose to; to then take a 2-0 lead against the champs on their court; then blow 3 straight; and then have historic, greatest-of-all-time ass whoopings and comebacks to secure games six and seven. This has already been an absolutely extraordinary playoff run, no matter what happens from here.

2024-05-28,1716922984,This has been the most enjoyable season of Timberwolves basketball of my life ,"I don't know if tonight is the end of their season. But if it is, its been a joy from the beginning, and I will always remember this season as an incredibly special one, no matter how it ends. 

56 wins, a first-round sweep of this teams regular season boogieman, historic game 6 and 7 wins against the reigning champs in the semifinals, a Western Conference Finals berth, and Ant proving to the entire world that hes a superstar that can go toe-to-toe with all-time greats in the playoffs. This season surpassed any and all expectations for both the team and nearly every individual player on it. 

If youre under \~30, then chances are youre in the same boat. Unless youre old enough to have been consciously, cognizantly watching the Timberwolves in 2004, this is it. 

Detonating out of the gates to a 20-5 record with thrilling wins against the Celtics and Nuggets, establishing themselves as the best defense in basketball, and waiting for them to come back down to earth and they just never did.

Rudy getting back to his DPOY self, KAT figuring out how to successfully reshape his game to be the power forward this team needed, Ant stamping himself as the next true two-way star in the NBA, Naz establishing himself as an elite role player and 6MOTY, Jaden and NAW becoming arguably the best perimeter defensive duo in basketball.

I've been religiously watching this team for longer than I care to admit, and I've never had this much fun or this much belief in finally having an unimpeachably great team.

This playoff run might be coming to an end in a fashion that none of us wanted to see. But if you went back even a month and told yourselves theyd make a run to the Western Conference Finals, youd be beside yourself ecstatic. Its a painful way to go out, but Ants 22; this is the start of a special era in Timberwolves basketball.

2024-04-25,1714075521,Think I figured out why other players hate Rudy Gobert so much,"All your life youve been gifted.

Basketball is everything. Youre a natural born talent and youve trained your whole life out of a joint desire to prove yourself and a genuine love for a beautiful game. You were always better than everybody around you until you finally made it to the big leagues. At last, a challenge, a place to belong. Iron to sharpen your iron. You are worthy of the NBA and the NBA is worthy of you. 

Youre no longer the best at everything all the time. But you can always do something special. Every night you have at least one play or stat to hang on your mantle. You poster some poor fool. You get a triple double. A clutch basket brings your team to overtime. Your teammates love you, they trust you. When youre on the court thats when youre free. Free to just ball and show the world who you are.

Its another Saturday night. Youre feeling hot. Made a couple tough shots, found a dime thats gonna be in highlight reels for the next week. Up five, youve got the ball, youre headed in for the easy layup

Hey buddy, whatcha doing?

*swat* 

Where the hell did the ball go?

Whatever. Shit happens in the heat of the moment. Onto the next play. You get back in time to defend but they sneak past. Up three. Again youve got the ball.

Non.

You see it this time, his arm reaching past and over you. Its not a block, or at least it wont be recorded as one. But that French fuck ruined your shot again. 

Down and back, down and back, hes right there why the hell did he pass you theoh, its because he couldnt get a good shot off with that fucking fuckface just standing there. Dammit. Clock is winding down, have to give it a shot, clank, since when are we down seven? 

Before you didnt notice him at all. Now you notice him everywhere. Any time youre driving, hes there. Any time youre passing, hes there. Any time anybody is near to doing anything, hes there. You cant help it. You start avoiding him. Hes not even *doing* anything, you tell yourself. Hes just& *standing* there, *menacingly.* But his reverse gravity pushes you away. You want nothing to do with him. Unfortunately, neither does the rest of your team. 

Nothing makes sense anymore. Youre here to play *basketball* dammit, its what you were put on this planet to do, and youre getting stopped by this& this *antibasketball* asshole. Yeah, thats it. Was he built in a lab to destroy the game? Maybe. You cant be sure. But hes not playing basketball in your mind. Hes ending basketball. All he does is ruin all your fun. Hes the kid who figured out the optimal strategies for Monopoly and always guarded the flag too close in gym class. Hes 2010 Spain in soccer. Hes Hungrybox in Melee. Someone in the crowd is yelling WOLVES IN THREE. That cant be right, thats not real, it should be Wolves in four. Are your ears lying to you? 

In your restless nightmares, all you see is that face. Those hands reaching, always reaching. You wake up. You look in the mirror. All you see is him. Wolves in three, Wolves in three, no escaping death for me! You giggle. What year is it? Does that matter?

Overrated you tell yourself as you dodge him at every opportunity. He has no bag you remind yourself as he gets a free dunk. Im still the man you say as his wide, loving arms envelop the stadium. Its not much. A feeble, paltry defense mechanism against the one man who can stop you from being you. But its enough to keep the nightmares at bay.

The guys will get it together this was a wake up call now everyone stop whining about the whistle like little bitches it won't be the same every game the players just have to adjust and not every call will be perfect.

And to just put perspective on the game, our 40% shooters outside KAT were just straight up clanking wide open 3s and layups were rolling in and out. The guys will be more focused on Sunday.

It was physical, arguments going on, and many hard fouls but Kat kept his head clear, didn't partake, and controlled himself. He was efficient on the offensive end and solid on the defensive end, even when guarding on the perimeter. He put in a ton of effort tonight and it really paid off. Only one foul on the night was a welcome surprise. Tonight he really looked comfortable in the lineup. If Kat can keep up this kind of effort on both ends of the floor, control his body and keep the fouls down, and stay cool headed like he did tonight, we can definitely keep up this level of play.",timberwolves,42,https://www.reddit.com/r/timberwolves/comments/17u2hvq/kat_tonight/

2024-05-13,1715609753,One of the most disheartening aspects of the game last night is that nobody but Ant responded to getting their asses kicked in game 3.,"The Timberwolves got demolished Friday night. Zero energy, zero urgency, just complete humiliation at the hands of the Nuggets in what could have been the practical knockout punch of the series. 

Game 4 had to be a massive response; going back to Denver after blowing a 2-0 lead would be catastrophic. 

Instead, most of the team once again just came out flat, looking rattled. No reliable offense and couldnt even knock down open shots, completely out of control on defense. Only a single bright spot out there, after a game with zero bright spots on Friday night. 

Ant came ready for battle last night and not a single other guy came ready to go with him. The second they finally got it close in the 4th, two of the most important players on this team immediately sold it with fouls, turnovers, and poor shot selection, quickly putting it out of reach. 

This is a roster of guys who outside of Ant either have a proven track record of not performing well in the playoffs, or guys who havent been there enough. 

It suddenly feels like theres very little this team can rely on other than Ant. Its a massive concern if you have guys like NAW or Jaden or even KAT not even able to hit open looks or reliably defend.

The inability to stop these actions has cost them both of these games. ,"The inability to defend Gafford and Lively rolling and in the dunkers spot is a colossally underrated aspect to this series. 

It doesnt matter how well Luka and Kyrie are defended if Gafford or Lively walk open wide open dunk. 

I dont give a fuck about a bad missed referee call or a bad Ant or Jaden turnover in crunch time. You have the best rim protector in basketball, you pride yourself on your size and having a three center rotation. Yet they are getting absolutely torched by the same goddamn action by a couple of athletic rim running centers with zero offensive skills. 

Tonight, Rudy (and KAT) were continually caught in no mans lands. They didnt defend at the level when doubling, they didnt drop and follow Lively or Gafford when the rolled. Luka and Kyrie didnt shoot well tonight. They hit timely shots, but the real killer was just spamming lobs and wide open feeds to Gafford and Lively in the dunkers spot. 

This has been a bread and butter of the Mavericks the last two months. This should have been scouted before game 1. You miss it game 1, fine. Then you adjust. Tonight, there was no adjustment, and it seems they have zero answer for that. 

This series will not go more than 5 games unless they can figure out how to stop that action.

Its crystal clear here that Taylor dropped a bomb out of nowhere when Arod and Lore met contractual obligations. I will also note that their legal has confirmed to them that they have an ironclad contract and there is no basis for Taylor to stand on. 

Taylor also said they are no longer welcome in the owners suite and to communicate with the FO when they literally own 40% of the team!!!

I am absolutely disgusted by Glen Taylor and his actions around this deal and I hope he never steps foot in Target Center again when Lore and Arod rightfully assume full control of the team.",timberwolves,108,https://www.reddit.com/r/timberwolves/comments/1br2ho4/arod_on_dane_moore_podcast_we_will_never_relent/

* Maintained 1st seed for most of the season, landed 3rd seed in a competitive West scene only 1 win behind #1 (Thunder) and #2 (Nuggets)
* #1 defensive rating, our defensive rating is 2.3 points higher than #2, a gap larger than the rating differential between #2 (Magic) and #10 (Knicks)
* Two All-Star players whove proven their selections were well-deserved
* DPOY on our team, giving Rudy his 4th to tie for most wins alongside Dikembe Mutombo and Ben Wallace
* 6MOTY in fan favorite Naz Reid whos come up big at times
* Franchise star, Anthony Edwards, 7th in MVP voting averaging 26/5/5 on 46/36/84 splits at only 22 years old in his 4th season
** Averaging 29/6/6 on 50/40/84 in the playoffs, having multiple 30 and 40pt games
** Only player besides Kobe to have consecutive 40pt games at 22yrs or younger in the playoffs
* Beat the Suns who had given us problems throughout the season to complete our first playoff series sweep, making it to the second round for the second time in franchise history. Many Wolves and Suns fans saw this as a first round exit for the Wolves
* Overcoming the reigning champion Nuggets in 7, pulling off a historic comeback
* Making our second WCF appearance, 20 years after our previous appearance

Im sure Im missing more, only really focused on accomplishments but theres also the narratives (Ants breakout, Rudy trade being vindicated, KAT stepping up in the playoffs following injury, etc.)& but Id just like to remind everyone of the season we had. Certain moments in the season already feel distant, like the struggles we had in the middle of the season or the worries about KAT going down late into the season. The Suns series itself already feels like it was ages ago and not three weeks ago.

Were living through franchise history that well look back upon as the good old days. Just think about all weve done and the records weve either set or joined. Well all have stories to tell about this season, the games we saw and where we were. Weve fostered a team culture to be proud of and I cant wait to see what the rest of the playoffs has to bring.

2024-05-29,1717014591,CONFIRMED: NBA Trying to Throw the Series for the Mavs,"The 2-minute report was released not too long ago and all but confirms the NBA is trying to aid the referees in throwing the series:

https://official.nba.com/l2m/L2MReport.html?gameId=0042300314

Key findings:

-Foul by KAT on Luka that sent Luka to the line for 3 FT and fouled KAT out of the game *was a confirmed Correct Call*

It has been pointed out in r/nba already that an offensive player making an unnatural shooting motion to draw a foul is supposed to be called an offensive foul:

https://x.com/NBAOfficial/status/1443591620901761040

The NBA has not, to anyone's knowledge, reversed this rule in the interim.

-Foul by Ant on Luka's 3-pointer that sent him to the line for a potential 4-point play *was ruled an Incorrect Call*

But do you know why it was ruled incorrect? Because the NBA inexplicably states that Ant *extended his hand across Doncic's arm as he went to gather.* Absolutely nothing about Luka flailing his legs (should have been an offensive foul), absolutely nothing about Ant not touching his arm on the shooting motion, but apparently Ant touched Luka's arm with a hand, ugh, *at some point* so it should have been a foul. I honestly don't even know what they're talking about here after going back to watch the replay.

-On the very next play, THE NBA STATES THAT KYRIE IRVING ""GRAZED"" NAZ'S ARM BUT THE CORRECT NO CALL WAS MADE

How do you justify a phantom arm touch literally a second prior, but when Kyrie ""grazes"" Naz's arm on a layup it's not a foul?? HOW?!?!

If one thing is clear after this game and the Game 2 foul Kyrie committed on Jaden McDaniels with 45 seconds left (that should have resulted in 2 FT attempts but instead gave the Mavs the ball), the NBA and the referees DO NOT WANT THE WOLVES TO WIN. They are not even trying to hide it!! Wolves have to beat both the Mavs AND the refs in order to win the next 3 =$",timberwolves,298,https://www.reddit.com/r/timberwolves/comments/1d3lzn8/confirmed_nba_trying_to_throw_the_series_for_the/

I hope Joker doesn't eat us up this season with KAT, nobody on this team can guard him now. We woulda never sniffed the WCF without KAT carrying in game 7 when we were down 20. I hope TC got some big plan to offload Randle somewhere, cause just a heavily protected pick is not worth losing the offensive play of Kat.

&gt;Asked Rudy Gobert about it after the game, he smiled and said, ""3 and 0, baby!""

&gt;**Anthony Edwards said he's liked the adjustment:** ""Rudy wanted to change that earlier in the year and they was like it doesn't matter. And then he said something about it again, and they changed it. And I agree with him. I think it does matter. Because if we on the opposite side of the floor, we can't hear the play calls. If we run something and he call something else, he mad at us and we don't know what he saying. So I think putting it over on our side is better because he can now call every play that we want and we can hear him and we can communicate with him offensively... Because defensively we got fuckin Rudy Gobert. We don't need them talking to us on defense. He doing all the talking.""

&gt;**Chris Finch on the topic:** ""What I like most about it is it made Rudy really happy. And a happy Rudy is a good Rudy for us.""",timberwolves,61,https://www.reddit.com/r/timberwolves/comments/1aqgxtx/moore_rudy_gobert_made_a_plea_to_the_coaching/

Glen Taylor is a bitch. If you havent learned that yet then I dont know what to tell you. Be a fan of another fucking team. Or like most MN fans we can hope and pray that he and the Pohlads go away. 

In any case the contract was unsustainable. For comparison, he was due more over the next 3 years than Nikola Jokic.

2024-05-13,1715620357,People thought Denver was dead in the water after 2 games. Now people think the Wolves are dead in the water after 2 games. Bottom line - this is anybodys series right now and prior games no longer matter. Wolves have an opportunity for greatness. Lets see if they can seize it.,"We all have a right to be frustrated. Wolves had a great opportunity to get this series to 3-1 and they didnt capitalize. That said, this is a 2-2 series against the Defending Champs and the best player in the NBA. You had to think they were going to fight back and they did. 

This playoffs we just saw the Knicks take a 2-0 series lead against the Pacers and now the series is 2-2 and the Pacers were up by as much as 35 yesterday. 

History shows us that wild swings throughout a playoff series can be expected and is actually quite common. That doesnt take away from the poor performances, however, it shows that the team and the players have to forget about it and move forward.

This is now a best of 3 and its going to provide some major clarification for us as it pertains to this roster. Can these guys forget about the past 2 and prove to us that they are different? Can we get some of the role players to step up? 

At the end of the day, one thing is extremely clear. Anthony Edwards is one of the best players in the NBA and he will have us competing for greatness for years to come.",timberwolves,113,https://www.reddit.com/r/timberwolves/comments/1cr4nap/people_thought_denver_was_dead_in_the_water_after/

At the same time, I cant say that quote makes me feel like& super comfortable about the attitude that Lore and ARod have here. Explicitly acknowledging (the word threatening has really seemed to rile up a lot of people) how much pain this process will cause toward the fanbase and franchise does not exactly engender fuzzy feelings.  

Edit because its not clear: I understand that this is explicitly, solely Glen Taylors fault. Lore and Arod seem to have a legitimate legal claim here and they have to do what they have to do to for recourse. Just for Lore to be coming out with such inflammatory rhetoric and publicly acknowledging how much pain this process will exact on the fanbase to me really casts a pall on what is shaping up to be the fanbases most memorable season in a generation.

My Timberwolves, who had the #1 defense have slowed down every offense in the playoffs except the Mavericks. That's a testament to how great Luka and Kyrie are, quite possibly the most talented backcourt in NBA history. 

On top of that, Lively and Gafford are hella underrated and dominated the glass which is tough to do against two 7 footers. Forget about seeding, I wouldn't be shocked if Dallas beat Boston to win it all. Congrats on the Finals appearance!!!

In 45 minutes, the same private jet company is planning on making the [reverse journey.](https://www.flightaware.com/live/flight/EJA596/history/20240506/1945Z/KMSP/KBJC)

BJC is a 20 minute drive from Ball Arena.

This doesn't mean anything, but I've personally have been thinking about this game too much to not go looking for some good news.

EDIT 6:34 PM Central Time: A [flight](https://www.flightaware.com/live/flight/XOJ782/history/20240506/2320Z/KMSP/KAPA) just took off from MSP to Denver Centennial (APA) If this flight happens to have a certain 7 foot french man on board it will touch down at little after 7pm mountain time and that individual would experience about a 20 minute drive according to Google maps.

  
My thoughts on what happened:

The XOJet flight has been scheduled all day - based on the timing I'm imaging this was booked as the last possible flight from MSP to the Denver area to get a man in the building in time for the game. When it looked like he could get to Denver earlier, some calls were made to the NetJets people, and they even got that plane (EJA596) to MSP - however, the jets NetJet flies are Cessna C680A and on the smaller side of business class jets. They weren't flying over the Dakotas/Wyoming all day. I think they were hoping to get Rudy on one of these earlier but the pilot or the airline or someone said not that jet through that storm. However the XOJet is a Cessna Citation X, larger than what NetJet flies, and was able to take off. I even noticed NetJets had a jet waiting with its radar on in the private staging area, it did not take off and powered down shortly after the flight we're all now watching took off.

All that to say - if he makes it to the game or not, let the wolves give em hell tonight. Congratulations to the big man. And if Rudy does make it back, by one of the flights we're watching, or some other way, kudos to whoever on the team's or Rudy's side who made it happen so that we could watch a better basketball game tonight.

It was fun plane watching with all of you today. Awooo!",timberwolves,210,https://www.reddit.com/r/timberwolves/comments/1clr9o2/rudys_return_flight/

2024-05-08,1715138221,The wolves really dont get enough credit for this trade.,"This trade was a brilliant move for the Wolves. Mike Conley brings invaluable experience and leadership to the team, far surpassing D'Angelo Russell's contribution. Plus, acquiring Nickeil Alexander-Walker has been an absolute steal, with his outstanding performance on both ends of the court. Tim Connelly orchestrated a masterpiece with this trade, not to mention the added benefit of the 2nd round picks. While much discussion revolves around the Rudy Gobert trade and its team impact, I really believe this particular move also deserves recognition as an elite decision that often goes overlooked by the media.

2024-05-29,1716947297,What a terrible experience for Wolves fans the NBA has given us,"First off&you have to tip your hat to the Mavs. They are playing great basketball and Luka and Kyrie are on another plant right now.

With that being said, with the refs and the commentary, its almost hard to watch. The wolves cannot catch a break in terms of fouls. We cant touch anyone and Dallas is just baiting/flopping and getting calls while the Wolves cant get a call to save our lives. 

Also, I dont think Reggie Miller has said one positive thing about the Wolves all series. If you only listened to him without watching the games, you would think the wolves have been blown out every game and this series hasnt been close. Ive watched the last two games on mute because of it.

First time were in the WCF in 20 years and we get a horrendous whistle and a commentator who just praises the Mavs while putting down the Wolves for everything. On top of being down 3-0 it has been a frustrating experience all around after the first 2 series. 

Regardless&Wolves in 7 till it aint.

Update: 

Really appreciate all the engagement from the post from both agreement and disagreement. Woke up very surprised with how much my half time frustration post resonated with everyone.

100% agree with those pointing out the Wolves flaws. We havent done ourselves any favors. Especially at the end of quarters. Dumb turnovers and dumb offense.

Also against just whining about refs to whine, but when its influencing the actual game play and ability to watch is when I have a problem. 

For example, in game 3 Jaden catches Lukas drive perfectly and takes a Luka shoulder in legal guarding position and its a foul on Jaden. Game 4, Ant drives from the top of the key, Derek Jones Jr does not get in front of him, but bumps Ant on the side and rides him all the way to the rim where Gafford blocks him. I guess if Ant falls and slides all the way to the bench it would be a foul. Also, Luka with the hook offensively in game 4 that doesnt get called, but how many times has Kat been called on that exact play. Also, Nazs lay up last night under a minute. Its an obvious fouling situation so refs should be aware and Kyrie swipes down and makes contact with Nazs arm and nothing. 

Its just frustrating the constant difference in how we are reffed compared to the Mavs and 
Its to the point where the wolves have to always think before they commit on defense. Luka is on fast break last night and sticks his arm
straight out to keep Ant away. Ant stops so he doesnt make contact. Luka has no pressure and makes a pass for a layup. 

When the reffing cause one team to have to think about how they have been called instead of just playing is when the refs are actually influencing the game which they should never do.

Also, Love Kevin Harlan and hes done a fantastic job as ways. The thing with Reggie and Van Gundy is that its not even smart analysis. Its almost like they made their points before the series and can only discuss the game from that angle. If the wolves go on a run, Reggie will legit stop talking. Jamal Crawford, though a bit much at times, at least called the game how it was being played and who deserved credit. Ill have to check out the other broadcast.

Wolves extend the series with a big game 5 at home.
