2024-05-16,1715848490,"It sounds lame, but being a thunder fan right now is a blessing.","If we win this series then OKC have outperformed all expectations and have proven to be one of the best young teams ever. They were barely supposed to be over .500 and expected to be in the bottom half of the top 8. Instead we are deep into a second round series. 

If we lose, it's due to youth and inexperience. Something we were and are all aware of coming into this season and playoffs. It will be disappointing, but it means the sky is the limit. If this is where we are at now, imagine another season under the teams belt alongside play off experience. Once we add the extra pieces, imagine where we will end up as a squad. 

Outside of this current iteration of the team, Presti has set the organisation up to be competitive for the next 5-10 seasons purely based on the volume of assets that have been collected. OKC aren't going away like the Detroits or Washington's.

I know the loss sucks, and I want nothing more than to rub a series win in the faces of the Mavericks hypocritical and ridiculous fan base, but we are very very lucky and I think our fan base needs to be grateful of that. I suppose there are a lot of recent fans due to our recent success, but a lot of us have seen the very very bad teams. 

It feels good to be a thunder fan. ",Thunder,35,https://www.reddit.com/r/Thunder/comments/1ct87ym/it_sounds_lame_but_being_a_thunder_fan_right_now/

Chet Holmgren I wish got more love then Wemby. All of nba knows Chet is the true ROTY, anyone who knows basketball. Sure Wemby is great too, but he's heck ton inefficient, Chet is not and he's just amazing and does everything perfect. And I don't like how much the media rides Wemby, give Chet some love too smh
 

I'm rooting for Thunder all the time and especially this yr, to hopefully yall  make the finals. This is an up and coming dynasty in the making. Every player on the team, complements one another so well. 

As a Heat fan I love our young talent we have aswell, Jovic, JJJ got me so excited this season aswell as the rest of our young core in Herro and Bam.


 I knew Thunder would find there way, I  had high hopes for yall. Getting everything together and everything, and watching the Thunder this season I just love how hardworking yall play, fight tooth and nail always and grind out them games to come out on top.

2024-07-17,1721238689,You guys just drafted Aaron Rodgers,"Nikola Topic is easily the best floor general of the last 4 drafts.  I didn't watch college Haliburton so I won't make the claim he was better, but he was a lot younger when drafted. I think he can be a Haliburton type of impact player on offense, but obviously he'll be a bit different.  He's way more of a downhill player which i personally value in a PG prospect. 

Biggest weakness is his 3p shooting -- was around 30% this year and 35% the year before.  Built in a Daryl Morey lab with a nearly perfect shot chart, midrangers are only taken late in the shot clock.  Historic paint touch / rim attempt / rim finishing rates (72% half court!?!?) for a guard. 88% from the line. Always pushes the pace in transition, unselfish, and he knows exactly what he's doing out there.  He's a strategical monster.  Manipulates defenses with his eyes to a degree I've never seen from a prospect.  Lightning fast processing.  Getting to practice against Dort and Caruso are going to speed his development. 

He is going to cook in OKC with all this spacing.  Hopefully he returns fully healthy.",Thunder,37,https://www.reddit.com/r/Thunder/comments/1e5olpi/you_guys_just_drafted_aaron_rodgers/

2023-12-07,1701961274,"So despite Presti straight up telling us that this was our last development year, y'all are still upset when we're giving guys development minutes and playing weird lineups.","We're also probably not making any trades before the deadline, because HE LITERALLY SAID HE WASN'T LOOKING TO MAKE TRADES UNTIL HE KNOWS WHAT HE'S GOT. I know we love to see the Thunder playing winning basketball, but they're very obviously not trying to go out and win a championship this year. They're still throwing shit at the wall to see what sticks, and if we make the playoffs, we'll see a different strategy. Just like last year.

So to answer the questions that pop up every game:

So what players should we go for before the deadline? None.

Why is Mark playing Tre Mann in random spots? Because we need to see what he does in those random spots in an actual NBA game.

Why are we letting Lu Dort jack up shots? Because we need him to be comfortable shooting the ball in an actual NBA game.

Why is Mark running half court sets with Chet handling the ball outside the 3 pt line? Because he wants Chet to work on those skills in an actual NBA game.

Should we trade Giddey? Probably not while his value is at an all-time low....but yes. Okay I couldn't resist that one.",Thunder,90,https://www.reddit.com/r/Thunder/comments/18cxg6z/so_despite_presti_straight_up_telling_us_that/

2023-12-07,1701924341,Can we all just chill,"The recent hate on this sub has been insane. Between the Giddey and Mark hate, this sub is becoming unbearable.

I know Giddey hasnt been playing well recently, but I feel like we have taken the hate too far. He is going through probably the worst time of his life right now between the allegations and his play recently. And it probably doesnt help when he sees his own supporters kick him while he is down. Not to mention he is literally 21. He is still young and has so much time to improve. To say we should trade him is a huge overreaction. I feel like he just needs to take a few games off or move to the bench until he gets his head straight.

Now the Mark hate is even more stupid. We have a coach that just placed 2nd in coach of the year voting, and some of you are already wanting him replaced. We should know by now that Mark priorities development over all else. So why are we freaking out when there are some new lineups out on the floor? Is it also not crazy to think that Presti is requesting some of these lineups? The way that we have reacted to him the past few games is just unbearable.

I would also just like to say that there are 82 games in a season. If you get 50 wins, you also get 32 losses. One loss is not the end of the world. We werent even supposed to be good.

2023-11-27,1701065402,Giddey Fallout - Honest Thoughts,"**No gossip or harassment in this post, Mods

What a last 3-4 days. Ive thought about the Giddey situation a lot and one word comes to mind: Disgusting. Its disgusting how this dudes name has been dragged through the mud by anonymous internet detectives looking to fill a void in their boring, pathetic lives. Its hard to grasp how quickly this story blew up and the extent to which many have run with it and labeled him terrible names like pedo. The entire story has been guilty until proven innocent - a sign of the times we live in, but its pathetic and dangerous. Shame on anyone that has taken part in the labeling and harassment of this guy based on internet gossip and rumor. 

To think that all of this has happened to a (seemingly) GOOD dude. Giddey has done everything right since joining OKC - plays hard, works to improve and has been active in the community (charity, OU/OSU games, etc). Yes, hes struggled on the court at times, but hes only 21. Off the court, yes, there are terrible people out there who put a mask on and come across as nice or likable - I dont know for a fact, but that doesnt seem to be Josh. Based on family, friend, and teammate feedback, hes a good guy with good intentions. 

Yes, hes obviously a classic member of Gen Z that is a bit reckless with social media. When you allow people to put your name and face out there, especially as a young, rich, successful NBA player, you open yourself up to scrutiny. You live and you learn. Im sure hes learned A LOT already. 

I really hope this turns out to be a massive nothing burger and things return to normal. Giddey JUST TURNED 21 and has his entire life/career in front of him. Like the rest of the NBA, he parties, hooks up and enjoys a life that comes with fame, wealth and notoriety. Could he have made a mistake? Of course - people sneak into clubs all the time with fake IDs or lie about their age. People also get hammered (Giddey included). That said, I highly doubt this guy is out seeking underage girls or the type of predator that hes being made out to be. 

Moral to the story: Wait until the facts come out and dont play judge, jury, and executioner. Nobody knows how old anyone was, what actually went down, or even whats real and whats not.",Thunder,187,https://www.reddit.com/r/Thunder/comments/184w6sm/giddey_fallout_honest_thoughts/
2023-10-28,1698464550,"[Nick Gallo] Shai is such a tone-setter. He didn't get to the free throw line at all until 4.6 seconds remained in the game. He didn't complain or get distracted. He just played. That stuff permeates, so the rest of the Thunder just played too. Heck of a road win after being down 10 late.",This is what happens when a leader knows what he is doing.

2023-12-28,1703789476,I Don't Want the Thunder to Trade for Anybody,"I don't want to see the Thunder trade for Kevin Durant, Isaiah Stewart, Alex Caruso, Zach LaVine, Lauri Markkanen, or anyone else that gets mentioned, that is, or could become available.

I like that we do have the assets to use to get almost anyone, but I don't want to use them.

There are flaws, but you don't solve one without creating another. Our lineups have a rebounding issue, but the Thunder are 1 of (if not) the best shooting team in the NBA. They are 3rd in FG%, 2nd in 3PT%, and 1st in FT%.

The Thunder are 6th in steals. They are 3rd in blocks. They have forced the most turnovers of any team. They are 2nd in lowest FG% allowed.

The team is fun! The players are all extremely likable! There are stars in Chet, Shai, and JDub. There is developing young talent in Giddey, Ousmane, Cason. Established veterans and absolute glue guys in Wiggins, Kenrich, Dort, and JWill. One of the best 3-point shooters in Isaiah Joe, and Bertans is always ready to fire away when he plays.

The end of the bench is Vasa, Poku, and Tre Mann. I honestly wouldn't mind Poku or Mann to be traded, not because I dislike them, (I love Poku and run the PokuStatTracker account on Twitter) but because they are both young and want them to get minutes.

The team is awesome to watch! For all the talk about how are the Thunder going to match up with some other team, I think about how is a team going to match up with the Thunder, because this team is good.",Thunder,147,https://www.reddit.com/r/Thunder/comments/18t1dvn/i_dont_want_the_thunder_to_trade_for_anybody/

2024-02-05,1707155210,Daily reminder that Josh Giddey is trash and we need to trade him for peanuts.,"On 25 minutes a game he's only averaging 12/6/5. Those are pathetic numbers. Dude is already 21 years old and hasn't even made an all-star yet. Total trash. I mean, in a month he's going to be as old as Chet was, at the start of the season and by that age, if a player doesn't have some mvp votes, or a few dpoy votes they're obviously a bust. And at #6 overall you really expect a victor wembanyama type of guy.

If a dude is getting paid $6 million dollars to put up the kind of crappy performances like we saw last night against Toronto or a few weeks back against Boston, that's really telling about the GM. Why did presti have to draft him at #6 overall? 

We could have Davion Mitchell, Boughknight, Zaiere Williams, Joshua Primo, Chris Daurte right now; even the corpse of Terrence Clarke would've probably been a better pick, imagine the stamina a zombie would have. Like Presti is so stupid. He didn't even make toronto not pick scottie barnes at #4 so we could've drafted him at #6. 

The whole reason we did this rebuild was so we could have 15 hall of famers on the roster at one time. But presti can't even do that right. I've seen a few commentors rightly point out that Giddey isn't even worth resigning. Imagine paying this guy $10 million a year or god forbid $15 million a year like we're paying Dort. You guys are right. He's not even worth the above totals. Much less paying him $20 million+, That's like a whole 13% of our cap. 

We need that cap space so we can draft a few more pokus, ie: actual good picks that didn't bust, unlike giddey. With a few more pokus we can confuse the opponet by making them think chet is still on the floor. What can we do with giddey? All he'll do is hog the ball and make stupid passes that are meaningless. He can't even play hall of fame level defense and his shooting is worse than ben simmons for crying out loud.

That's not even to mention all of the jail time he's done this season, from being found guilty of sleeping with a minor. Honestly might just need to nail him to the cross so he can take away our sin of drafting him, kinda like jesus.

Hes also about the same size as Mr. Thunder himself, with similar impact, usage, and efficiency, though Collison felt like a bigger piece of the early Russ/KD years. Nick didnt play pro til he was 24. JWill is only 21 and had already played 13% as many career games as Nick had, a lot of time left to grow

Some quotes from Alex Carusos press conference today from Thunder beat writer Brandon Rahbar:

 His first words to the media: This is the most people to ever welcome me somewhere.

 Its funny cause he (Coach Mark) still has the personality and demeanor on the sidelines as he did.. when I was playing with the Blue..

He puts the players first. Hes a good leader.

 Im a really competitive guy and I think Im most competitive with myself&

Thats something thats in my DNA& I just expect to get the job done.

 Mark, I was smiling ear to ear talking to him on the phone.

Caruso says hes really excited to play for Daigneault again.

He said Mark told him not to be a smart ass and he told Mark he cant wait for him to cuss him out.

 Just really excited to be here&

I think the things I do well complement the team. Team first guy.

 Alex Caruso was asked if hes seen any OKC teammates yet: I met Jaylin.. tall Jaylin.. JWill.

Kudos to Caruso for already knowing the difference between JWill and JDub.

Caruso says that SGA reached out to him and said hes excited to have Caruso on the team.

 Theyre young, theyre hungry.. thats something Im excited to be a part of.

 He says that in Chicago, he was opposing teams #1 focus on defense but that in OKC with Lu Dort and Chet Holmgren, he may be third and hell take advantage of it or if teams put him first, Lu and Chet will take advantage.

 Alex on OKCs defense: Really excited. I looked up highlights on YouTube the other day of them playing defense&

Im excited to add to that.

 He said yeah, I think so when asked if he can see himself here long term. He said that conversation is for a different place and time for now, Id like to get to meet my teammates and get to work 

 Facility is still the same, so I know where everything is at. Just really excited to be here.

We're a **.700 team.** Does anyone understand just how good that is?   

There's no reason why we couldn't win a title *this very season.*    

There's absolutely no excuse for a team with 15 first round picks to be scared of literal play-in teams because they're a ""nightmare matchup.""    

We have all the assets in the world to fill every single hole on our roster.    

Presti could trip, fall, and drop three first round picks into the gutter and we'd still have the best asset pool in the league.    

Why is everyone (Presti included) so content with ""seeing how it goes"" this year? Why not make an actual run?     

The Thunder could've easily added size at the deadline, for example, our literal 2024 1st rounder was used to get Gafford. Why not keep him for ourselves instead of giving him to Dallas? It would've been such a low-risk move.


**TLDR: If the Thunder end up losing in the playoffs because of lack of size, while holding 15 first round picks in their pocket, it's a huge miss and a massive wasted opportunity. You never know what the future holds and when you have this many assets, you can easily afford to address your weaknesses.**    

PS: Even though I'm criticizing Presti here, doesn't mean that he isn't an incredibly elite GM who is primarily responsible for us being where we are. I appreciate him a ton.",Thunder,150,https://www.reddit.com/r/Thunder/comments/1b7oxz4/writing_off_a_700_season_is_insane_to_me/

KD facilitated a sign-and-trade on his way out of Golden State to help the Warriors get D'Angelo Russell, Shabazz Napier and Treveon Graham.     

They then flipped Russell for Andrew Wiggins and a 1st round pick (Jonathan Kuminga). Wiggins was instrumental in the Warriors winning the title in 2022.

&gt;As a result of the sign-and-trade and some sequenced signings, the Nets had enough cap space to sign Jordan to a four-year, $40 million deal and Claxton to a three-year, $4.2 million deal rather than giving him the minimum for only two years. The Nets brass believed it might take the Georgia product more than two years to develop and Claxton would be happier with the added security.

&gt;Moreover, while KD agreed to the S&amp;T construct, he also reportedly demanded that the Nets get something beyond Russell in the trade and according to Brian Windhorsts reporting later that July. **Durant wanted the Warriors to give the Nets a first round pick.** (Which they ultimately agreed to).   
 
And when KD was traded to the Suns, the Nets completed their entire rebuild in one trade by receiving:   

Mikal Bridges, Cam Johnson, Four First Round Picks (2023, 2025, 2027 and 2029) and a First-Round Pick Swap in 2028.    

----   

People rag on LeBron for being ""LeGM"" but KD has slithered his way behind the scenes, orchestrating trades and signings just the same.   

He went out of his way to help the Warriors. He went out of his way to help the Nets.     

What did he do for the Thunder?    

He walked.    

We got nothing for him.    

Zero assets.     

People completely forget about this because Presti has done such an amazing job accumulating assets that it doesn't really hit home that we lost the most valuable asset in the entire league at the time for **nothing**.     

Paul George will always be a friend of the Thunder because he actually helped us get value in his departure. Hell, we even got Chris Paul for Westbrook.   

KD is a snake. He can lay in the bed that he made. The Thunder can win without him. We're not ""one Kevin Durant"" away from a championship, there are a number of players out there who would put us over the edge.   

KD needs the Thunder a lot more than the Thunder need KD. And we know what he did last time we needed him.",Thunder,102,https://www.reddit.com/r/Thunder/comments/1cxqw6b/a_friendly_reminder_for_those_who_want_kd_to/

We want to thank Josh for his many contributions to our team and know he will capitalize on the opportunities before him in Chicago. 
 
When we drafted Josh in 2021 he was an essential aspect of our vision for the next iteration of the Thunder. Since then, our team has evolved rapidly and dynamically in ways we could never have anticipated. Therefore, as we began our internal discussions this off-season, it was determined that bringing Josh off the bench next season was our best option to maximize his many talents and deploy our team more efficiently over 48 minutes. 
 
As we laid out to Josh how he could lean into his strengths and ultimately optimize our current roster and talent, it was hard to for him to envision, and conversations turned to him inquiring about potential opportunities elsewhere. As always was the case, Josh demonstrated the utmost professionalism throughout the discussions. Josh has All-Star potential, but accessing that in the current construct of the Thunder would not be optimal for the collective. Based on these discussions we decided to move forward and prioritize what was best for the organization.

He's had a rough year, and you cant convince me that being called a child predator, being called a bust, and every other name under the sun hasn't affected his game this year. Just turned 21,  you're getting booed at every away game, dealing with questions you're not supposed to answer, but want to.... and see your name forever defamed on social media. Let's be clear.... this is fact. He was at an 18+ club, as a 19 year old, almost 20. Girl starts coming up to him said she's also 19. He then has a a 36 hour quickie w her, and then finds out, ghosts her. She then gets on social, says they had a relationship for clout. Not understanding what she was saying would get her and especially him into hot water. That's why she lawyered up....not to go after Giddey, to keep the police away, bc it was her that instigated and lied. That's why she didnt cooperate, and why she didn't file a civil suit. No hush $ involved. Let's be logical, if you don't believe the true story,  who gets on social as an NBA player with a KNOWN minor? No one. Meaning... he had no idea. The last 10 games he has looked different. Averaging 15/7/6 with hardly any TOs. Doing this in about 20 min a game. That's quality work all the way around. I truly think he rises from here, also finding rythym in his new role. Anyway, appreciate the long read, just try to think if you were this dude, comes from Down Under, to the Social Media Mecca of the world, and this happens. Confidence is a necessary attribute to playing well, and you can see he's starting to get some of it back. Anyway, just proud of the dude, and glad he's turned a corner. Well see if he can keep it going. #ThunderUp",Thunder,132,https://www.reddit.com/r/Thunder/comments/1bhqi8w/proud_of_giddey/

The way I see it, that shot SAVED OKC and was a DETRIMENT to Dame's career. That shot resulted in us getting Shai, who is quite literally better than Dame right now. On top of that, the next 5 years for Dame have been nothing more than mediocrity. He got bounced out the first round in 2020 and 2021, and didn't even make the playoffs in 2022 and 2023. I feel like that 2019 shot and that series as a whole gave the trail blazers franchise an impression that they could build around Dame, but that would turn out to be a horrible decision, which is evident from the past 4 years. Additionally, Dame has had an abysmal season for the Bucks and is a big reason for their lackluster play.

That shot allowed us to acquire Shai, a superstar who is now a top 5 player in the league and (imo) better than Dame ever was at any point in his career. On top of that, we were able to garner heavy draft capital and went through an entire cultural reset characterized by development of young talent and strategic positioning for future success. We're ultimately in a better position right now than we've ever been since the Russ-harden-kd era to make multiple championship runs. 

What do yall think?

Sam Presti sat me down and said, I think you can be a really good coach' offered 2 paths, a cushy player development job with the Thunder, ""or there's the option to go to the GLeague and work for this guy, Mark Daigneault""","story by Jonathan Feigen

---

Ivey had returned from China, knowing on some level that he was through as a player but needing to hear it from Thunder general manager Sam Presti. Presti had followed Iveys career since he was an assistant with the Spurs and Ivey was a part of Rick Barnes second recruiting class at Texas. They had gotten to know one another in Iveys two stints with the Thunder.

I never knew I was going to be a coach, Ivey said. Sam Presti sat me down and said, I think you can be a really good coach. I said, Oh, really? I took a leap of faith.

It was more complicated than that. Over dinner in Portland, Ore., Presti offered Ivey two choices, believing there was a better path for Ivey, but keeping that thought to himself.

Its never an easy conversation to have with a player, Presti said. They have to decide when theyre ready. But I thought it was the right time to put it on the table and see what he was thinking.

When we were talking about what was next, whats life after basketball was going to be, I was throwing out the idea of potentially going into coaching. I explained to Royal there were two paths we could take. We could do something in player development, and he could be around the Thunder & and stay in the world youre accustomed to, in the NBA and all the benefits that come with it in terms of the travel and the luxury that were all afforded. Or there is the option to go to the G League and work for this guy, Mark Daigneault (now the Thunder coach.)

I told him, It isnt going to be very glamorous. It wont be a fun path, but it will give you the most exposure to the things you have the least experience with. And then, I kind of held my breath waiting for the answer, knowing that if he really wanted to excel and build a life after basketball that would be sustainable and strong, the G League path was the path. But I didnt want to push that on him.

Ivey chose to be an assistant with the Oklahoma City Blue, a decision that Presti said was choosing the path less traveled not unlike a kid from Harlem choosing to play for Texas, or that Ivey said was like becoming the South Sudan coach to get out of my comfort zone.",Thunder,13,https://www.reddit.com/r/Thunder/comments/1e8o2mw/south_sudan_head_coach_royal_ivey_i_never_knew_i/

Turns out SGA was already there at the gym, working out for hours with Steve Nash.","story by Danny Chau

---

There is a story that Canadian basketball lifer and former mens national team coach Jay Triano likes to tell about Shai Gilgeous-Alexander. 

Its a July morning in Manila, 2016. Team Canada is in the Philippines for the Olympic Qualifying Tournament. The entire roster is on the team bus, bright and early, headed to its first practice.

Everyone but Gilgeous-Alexander, a surprise inclusion as a 17-year-old rising senior who was months away from committing to Kentucky: a teenager on a team full of grown adultsincluding Tristan Thompson, whod just won an NBA championship with the Cleveland Cavaliers a few weeks prior. The youngster soon to be known as SGA was nowhere to be found. 

OK, lets go, Triano, then in his second stint as the head coach of the national team, told the driver. Were going to show young fella you cant be late for a bus, Triano thought. 

As the team got off the bus and stepped onto the court, Triano saw Shai already working out with national icon Steve Nash, then the Canadian mens national team general manager. 

I guess Steve had woken him up and said, Come on, youre not playing a whole lot. Lets go to the gym, Triano told The Ringer last week. And they spent a couple hours in the gym before we even got there for our practice. And when Steve takes an interest in somebody, then he believes in that guy.",Thunder,23,https://www.reddit.com/r/Thunder/comments/1ec36br/coach_jay_triano_tells_a_story_how_in_2016/
