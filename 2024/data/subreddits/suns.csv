2024-02-09,1707461934,KD showing more great leadership,"Dude is really taking Bol Bol under his wing. Using an iPad to show Bol how to avoid cheap fouls. 

KD did the same with the young dudes in Brooklyn. He really helped Cam Thomas a ton. He also helped Claxton and Sharpe. These are things the media never talked about. 

The media saying KD is a bad leader is such a false narrative. Has KD ever quit on the court? Has he ever not given full effort? Has he ever taken shortcuts in practice or in the off season? His work ethic is legendary. 

I cant recall a single time KD has thrown a current teammate under the bus. Or even a coach. When he plays a crap game he takes 100% responsibility. But he wont hesitate to communicate on court if he sees his teammates making mistakes. 

I dont understand what the media wants him to do. Is it about giving good speeches before games? Or boast about being a great leader in his interviews? 

The whole narrative that he is a bad leader started in Golden State. The media wanted to do everything they could to minimize his accomplishments there. They could not criticize his play. They could not criticize his off court conduct.

KD's rubbed off on Booker, and not in a good way. He's convinced him that having a cool looking game and efficiency stats is better than winning.

2023-12-18,1702866232,The Suns Play too slow and its because Booker is trying to be Chris Paul instead of Devin Booker,"Book is doing things this year I have never seen I'm do before. The main is when he gets the ball he holds it (often for way too long) and surveys the court. Before this year book was always just attack, and reacting to what the defense gave him.

The other thing is he is massively indecisive. He doesn't have an idea of what he wants to do. So he drives into the lane, picks up the ball, and has absolutely no where to go. He stands around trying to find someone to pass back out to. Before this year he went in to score. Full stop. Book was going to score. and if the defense closed in a way that left someone open and he could make the pass he would make it.

Franks Said Book download Chris Pauls brain and it seems so obvious that is true because These are all things CP does. At least old CP does in terms of picking his dribble up after driving because he didn't have the athleticism to beat his defender.

Our teams pace this season is 97.78

Last year when CP would always walk the ball up the floor our pace was 98.83.

How did we lose the slow old man and yet our pace got slower?'

Booker has always been the engine of this team. He should be pushing the ball and running on misses every single possession. All book is doing by walking up the floor or holding the ball when he gets it is allowing the defense to get set, or allow a team to blitz him. The team goes when he goes and he's not supercharging this team.

KD inherently will slow down the pace with how he plays but Book can not also play slow. 

In the playoffs when book got the ball off a KD double he immediately attacked. When book took the ball up the floor he did it as fast as possible. He did everything to keep defenses off balance. Now he's letting defense be comfortable.

Book has to go back to attack mode with a score first mentality again. He can playmake as the defense shifts to him attacking. He averaged 7.2 assists In the playoffs attacking. and he averaged 6.8 assists in the 18-19 season when he had literally no one who could score other than him. He lead the league in potential assists for multiple years when we were bad. All of those times he had his score first and attack mentality. 

This manage the game slow pace has to stop. Play fast Play more aggressive, Attack, and the rest of the team will follow with that energy.",suns,50,https://www.reddit.com/r/suns/comments/18kxw28/the_suns_play_too_slow_and_its_because_booker_is/

* Fasting generally entails abstaining from food, drink, and sexual relations from before the first light of dawn until the setting of the sun. Muslims are required to fast on each of the 29 to 30 days of Ramadan. If unable to fast, charity or fasting days outside Ramadan may suffice. A pre-dawn meal is common and considered to be a highly meritorious practice. Breaking fast at sundown is often done with dates and milk, followed by a fuller meal after the evening prayers. In addition to the five daily prayers, a very important optional practice is to gather for additional communal prayers after the night prayer each night of the month. This prayer is called Tarawih.

2024-05-02,1714671463,I believe in Bradley Beal ,"I get it. He shit the bed in the playoffs. He promised we wouldn't get swept and we did. But yall are acting like it's all his fault. 

Brad was used to being THE GUY in Washington, the best talent he had next to him was an aging injury prone John Wall. He went from a fan base with low expectations in a small market to a fan base expecting a chip This Year. Not to mention all the unlucky injuries that kept him out. 

Despite all that, he gave everything he had in the limited time we had him. The last 10 games of the season showed us that Brad wants this. And he wants to be here. Yeah he's on a bad contract from a team POV, but yall are blaming him for having the best possible contact a player could get. 

Brad Beal is the Real Deal. I'm excited to see what he can do next season. ",suns,110,https://www.reddit.com/r/suns/comments/1cilpcx/i_believe_in_bradley_beal/

Made this thread 3 1/2 months ago and there were still some Eubanks supporters (lol)

&amp;#x200B;

Eubanks has a +/- of -108 on the season. The only Suns rotation player in the minus let alone in 100s our other guys who were minuses we traded in the Royce trade. Vogel and Eubanks love affair has cost us literally many games this season. I think someone from the FO told him he is fired if Eubanks sees minutes. This dumb fuck hopefully finally has him out of the rotation.

2024-03-20,1710910378,Booker has to be better,"Book is the face of the franchise.

Book is in his physical prime at 27 years old.

In the last 4 games he is shooting 11% from 3. 

It is time for Book to take over. I think it is obvious that KD needs a break at this point. Dude is 35 and playing 40 minutes almost every game that isnt a blow out. He can only do so much after how much minutes he played so far. He needs a little recharge before the playoffs.

This is where Book needs to carry. Beal is finding his grove also. But Book is the key. He has to go off scoring 35-40 points regularly to close the season. 

Book needs to up his defense. He needs to take the challenge to be the lead point of attack defender. 

Book is in his prime. He has the energy to do so. ",suns,54,https://www.reddit.com/r/suns/comments/1bj5j0u/booker_has_to_be_better/

2023-11-23,1700740183,"KD is number ONE in the league in 3pt % (52.2%) (aside from being #2 in scoring average and #3 in minutes per game and Booker is #1 in Freethrow% (94.6%), while being 9th in scoring &amp; 3rd in assists","KD and Book are lifting the entire team up in this 5 game winning streak, and their individual play has shown it in the stats.  Also, we are just ONE spot away from the top 4 in the west (currently top 5 and first in the Pacific) with still about a week to spare in November and NO BRADLEY BEAL :-)

Just would like to point out all these amazing things to celebrate to all our fellow Suns fans who like to look at the negative side of things for the most part, even DESPITE a 5 game winning streak ;-)

Are we a finished product? FAR FROM IT, which is what makes it even more exciting = As good as our two stars have been, what's scary is they could get even better with KDs FT% slowly climbing back up to 90% and Book (despite his current shooting slump), bouncing back with both a good rebound and assist game , being 2 rebounds away from his first triple double in the regular season. Also, our bench are now starting to find some chemistry which will help our turnovers, our coach is also figuring out things and can definitely get better which will help our rotations, and our starting five is now the best starting five in the league in terms of +/-  and can STILL get better :-)

Another thing, it may sound farfetched, but IMHO, we have TWO MVPS on our team playing out of their minds right now :-)

Can't wait to see what our December will start to look like once we get Bradley back in the equation...he's the fastest among the 3 and will definitely help with his penetration more than his shooting :-)

2024-04-26,1714168843,Some of you are over-romanticizing the team prior to the KD trade. ,"Did they make The Finals? Yeah. Did they win it? No. Did they go to The Finals the following year? No. Were they humiliated in the playoffs that year? Big time. Was CP3 injury prone at critical times in the season? Yes. Did CP3s health hurt the Suns in the playoffs each year? Yes. Was Atyon really good during the Finals run in 2021? Yes. 2022? No. 2023? Nope - Ayton quit on his team. Unreliable. Lazy. Man-child staying up until the wee-hours of the morning on game days playing video games. Was Crowder a reliable force on the floor? Oftentimes, but hed completely disappear at others. Were Mikal and Cam Johnson fun, youthful faces for this team? Yes. Did we love their commitment to the team and community? Yes. Did we love this teams personality in large part because of them? Yes! Could Mikal lock down opponents on defense? Yes. Are the Suns sorely missing defense now? Yes! Was Cam J consistent on the floor? No? Was he injury prone? Yes. Did The Twins get better each year after the Finals run? No. Was Cam Payne a great personality/sparkplug who played with passion? Yes! Was he consistent? No. Was he a decent facilitator at point? Ehhhhh. Sometimes. Was he out of control and turnover prone? Yes. Was Monty a great guy? Yes! Kindhearted and a class act? Absolutely! Did Monty make great in-game adjustments? No. Did Monty have what it took to get these guys to come together? No. Arguably, the team started falling apart under his watch. Go on and on and on and these are all great, nice guys. Theyd have occasional good games but we remember the vibe before the games. During the warmups. Dancing. Singing. Interacting with fans. We loved the interviews and the lemonade stand and the Were the best effing team in the mother-effing world chants.

None of this translated to winning when it counted on the court. The 2021 Finals run was the peak. There were too many weaknesses exposed in the two seasons since. Playoffs which ended in way-too-early and way-too-humiliating fashion. 

The KD trade was one the Suns needed to make. It would have been ideal to keep Mikal but thats not how trades work. You have to give to get. Yes, the face of that fun-loving team full of nice guys was gone, but we werent going to win it all going down that road. 

And those who think otherwise would be the same ones bitching and moaning that they fell short in the playoffs again this year and would be crying out for a change. 

Those days were fun for a franchise that hadnt been there in a looooong time. But if we want a team of fun guys at the expense of a championship& I dont think any true Suns fan would want that forever. 

This team needs more tweaking, clearly. Well get there. But for those of you over-romanticizing the team we used to have& they were fun. They were nice. But they werent going to win it all. Change needed to happen. 

Were in the middle of that change right now. ",suns,159,https://www.reddit.com/r/suns/comments/1cdxx72/some_of_you_are_overromanticizing_the_team_prior/

Jru Holiday and Derrick White. Oh wow look at us, were great all around guards and top tier defenders that fit well together. Who cares? First of all your names are spelt wrong. We have Booker and Beal, their names pretty much rhyme, and do you have any idea how many times they each scored 50 in a loss? Tons! You guys never score 50. Gimme a break!

Your fans are fucked and your coach is literally insane. Larry Bird aint walking through that door, and even if he was, KD would roast his country ass all the way back to French Lick Indiana.

The Suns are so explosive. A 15-20 point lead is nothing.

KD can drop 40 on 15 shots on any night 

Beal can drop 40 like nothing 

Gordon can knockdown 6 threes in a row

Grayson can knockdown 10 threes

And if things get desperate they can put KD at center and switch everything and suffocate your offense.

Book and CP3, one of the best backcourts in NBA history for a few years. I honestly belive that the aquastition of Chris Paul to the Phoenix Suns is what helped Booker go from being a star player to a superstar player. Booker was obviously already highly skilled and uber confident even before Paul but I do believe Paul helped Booker refine his game and turn Booker into the player he is today. After Paul Booker has played much more efficient, his playmaking has improved, his leadership has improved, and his overall feel for the game in orchestrating an offense has improved. 

Overall, best thing that could have happened to Book.

2023-12-30,1703911944,Beal wont make a difference,"All the dumbass doomers eat shit.

Beal makes all the difference in the world. Why wouldnt a 30 year old max player?

Beal opens the offense completely:

Teams cant double Booker 30 feet from the basket or they will give up a wide open 3 to a GREAT SHOOTER. 

Teams cant hard double KD in the post without giving up an open 3 to a GREAT SHOOTER.

Nurk has so much room in the paint its ridiculous. When Josh/Goodwin were playing their defenders ignored them and would frequently double team Nurk. Cant do that anymore without giving up a wide open 3 to a GREAT SHOOTER. 

We are no longer playing 4 vs 5 on offense.

There are always at least 2 stars on the floor at all times. 

Gordon and Allen dont have to create as much on offense. Most of the time they just have to spot up and bomb away.

Gordon has way more space to spot up. Notice how much closer to the 3 point line he was talking his shots. Without Beal he had to backup farther because there was no space.

Booker can drive to the rim without 2 Guys waiting for him. In the past Josh/Goodwins defenders would sag into the paint.

Beal is another guy who can play PG. This allows Book to play more off the ball.",suns,240,https://www.reddit.com/r/suns/comments/18u7b9q/beal_wont_make_a_difference/

&gt; James, the son of NBA superstar LeBron James, will remain in the NBA Draft after one season at USC. James, who suffered a cardiac arrest last July before returning to the court for his freshman season, has been fully cleared to play by the NBAs Fitness to Play Panel.

&gt; While not considered a top prospect  James was not included in The Athletics post-lottery mock draft  his surname and journey back to the court following a serious health scare make him one of the more notable players in this years draft class.

&gt; Theres also the added intrigue of whether James and his father could become teammates. LeBron has expressed a desire to end his career playing alongside his son.

&gt; Since the end of a disappointing season, Phoenixs offseason plan, particularly with the draft, has been a daily conversation. With the 22nd pick, the financially limited Suns need a player who can contribute immediately. Thats probably not James. He could play and develop in Mullett Arena, a few miles from where the Suns play in downtown Phoenix. But that wont help the Suns, built around the star power of Booker, Durant and Beal, get immediately closer to a title. Their window wont stay open forever. Some think it has already closed.

&gt; Of course, theres the LeBron factor. Is it possible drafting James could help the Suns lure LeBron to the desert on a minimum contract? Probably not.

Phoenix will have 15 Suns active tonight so the Timberwolves will be 15 times more scared than they usually are of only one singular Sun. This is a huge disadvantage for them. 

Anthony Ant Man Edwards is a KD Stan (who can blame him). He could never live with himself knowing he contributed to his GOAT falling back into the play-in. He will obviously do his best to win, but the underlying emotion will get to him (Its human nature).

Rudy Gobert is French. No one like French people. All they do is paint, smoke cigarettes and drink coffee with their funny little hats. I dont even like French bread, and French vanilla tastes just like regular vanilla. Why lie? French fries are the best thing they have and those arent even French. French kissing seems kinda neat but Ive never tried it on a real girl so Im undecided. 

The Suns should win easily.

What hes been doing lately takes a lot of unselfishness and respect. Not alot of players would take a back seat. I think him making good money and those last years In DC helped him make this adjustment. He was the booker for wizards-taking the ball and score. He wants to win something this is why he wanted a trade he knows what he has to do to help the team win. His play making skills pass first has been amazing lately. Hope you guys win it.

Maybe its this way for other team subs as well. Im convinced a lot of members of this sub are far more interested in the GM gamethan the game of basketball, which makes for incessant hatred of the team in ways that have nothing to do with the sport. Boston in the 2000s is the only team I can think of that won the championship the same year the super team was constructed. Lebron and AD missed the playoffs in year one, if I recall correctly. Was this year a disappointment? Sure, but I actually enjoyed a lot of the basketball and, I hate to break to to everyone, but if you cant enjoy the game unless the team wins a championship, you picked the wrong team. Maybe it will happen someday, but if thats the bar, being a fan is miserable. Anyways, Im leaving this sub because its toxic and I enjoy myself more without it. I will, however, indulge in one last toxic interaction by staying in the sub long enough to follow any comments and talk shit to whoever disagrees with me.

2024-04-10,1712718448,We ruined the core of this team for nothing,"Reactionary post time but it's time to say what we are all thinking deep down.

Booker, Ayton, Mikal and Cam were a core that fit together, still at a young age and were good enough to get us to fight in playoff series.

We had that and all of our assets to help strengthen the team around them. One 1st got the Lakers an entire new bench and some starters last season, a 1st got the Mavs PJ Washington and a good backup in Gafford.

And we had 4 1sts and all our swaps to help strengthen the team around them, either to rebuild the depth or trade for a fringe all star type to add to the core we had.

Instead we traded everything bar Ayton for a mid 30 year old player in an all in move that backfired. Then doubled down this off-season to trade Ayton for another veteran who will be unplayable in a playoff setting.

Now we have an injury prone star trio who don't fit with fuck all around them. We blew up this team to get really old and aren't remotely competitive with no picks to retool.

Rant over, we fucked this team when we didn't need to go all in. We had years before we needed to go for an all in, but we brought the timeline forward 5 years and fucked it up.",suns,315,https://www.reddit.com/r/suns/comments/1c0be7f/we_ruined_the_core_of_this_team_for_nothing/

2024-01-20,1705734206,So glad we dumped Ayton,"I heard so many people say that Ayton had a chance to really blossom this year after the Suns fired Monty. That the coach held him back. That all he needed was a fresh start with a new coach. Then we would see aggressive and hustling Ayton.

Well he got a fresh start in Portland and he is the same Ayton. When people keep telling you who they are believe them. 

Im not here to bash but trading his $103 million 3 year max contract was so smart. Portland is stuck paying this guy $34 million a year for the next 3 years.

Look at his stats:

13 points per game. Career low

0.7 blocks. Career low. How can this guy average less blocks than 63 guards. 

Gracen Allen is averaging the same amount of blocks as Ayton =

1.5 free throws a game. Career low. Absolutely pathetic that a center averages that few free throws. This literally means this guy is hardly ever attacking the rim. 


Ayton is 9th on his team in free throws. Literally every starter and every rotation player has taken more free throws than him. This literally almost impossible to do in the NBA. Unless you are literally doing everything you can to avoid any contact.

Saben Lee playing less than 7 minutes a game is averaging more free throws a game than Ayton=

56.7% TS. Career low. His least efficient scoring season ever. 

The guy is just BAD. CP3 was spoon feeding this guy. Without an elite point guard drop him easy buckets he struggles. He is probably the worst max contract in the league.

Ayton is just BAD. And he is getting paid a Max contract. 


Ayton $34 million 

Nurk $17 million

Allen $9 million

Little $6 million

An absolute steal.

Domi-Ayton is probably the most farcical nickname ever. 

Am I bitter? A bit. This dude basically forced the Suns to give him a max contract and then played lazy basketball for 2 years. Tanked his trade value so hard.

2024-05-27,1716787411,If Luka wins a ring the failure of drafting Ayton will be COMPLETE,"barf in my mouth 

How did the Suns staff not see that Ayton was lazy and non motivated?

This isnt hindsight. Before the draft I 100% wanted Luka. You dont dominate Euro-league as a teenager without being an absolute stud.

Look at his draft profile: 

Must improve intensity and competitive nature

Tends to settle for jump shots and roams to the perimeter far too often & Can assert himself better as he can go through the motions

He rarely played like he had anything to prove and was complacent offensively

Showed some ability to put the ball on the floor and drive but still resorts to jab stepping and settling for a shot

Sometimes is a bit passive and can be lazy at times

Can play with too much finesse when he has a mismatch and should be more physically dominant with his superior size and athleticism 

His current weaknesses are very much related to his immaturity

Ayton's motor and aggressiveness has been questioned

At 7-feet tall he can dominate the game in the paint, but can often get caught floating around the perimeter

Doesn't protect the rim despite his tools and quick leaping ability. Below average awareness and instincts.

Competitiveness really comes and goes

Ayton seemed bothered at times by the physicality of the very strong crop of international big men that he faced in Toronto, and was a step slow at times with his decision making and reaction speed

Versus Luka

Versatile all around guard/forward who can do just about everything on the court & Probably the most mature prospect that Europe has seen in years & His Basketball I.Q is off the charts & A natural born leader, excels under pressure, who takes and makes big shots & Not afraid of the big stage, since he has been the center of attention since he was 15 years old & He has been used as a point guard from young age and really knows how to control the tempo of the game

Has great feel for the game & Very good ball handler, with a nice crossover and step back dribble on his repertoire& Nice hands that help him in all aspects of the game& Already a very good scorer, he can score in every way possible& When he gets hot is really difficult to stop him& Great shooting mechanics and good looking shooting form& His Pull-up game and shot of dribble are lethal& He is a threat on Spot Up and Catch and Shoot situations& Attacks closeouts and can either go all the way to the hop or stop and shoot& Knows his way around the screens and uses them excellent& Has the ability post-up smaller opponents and punish miss-matches with a variety of moves thanks to his good footwork& Drags bigs away from the basket on switches and tries to exploit any advantage on his favor& Can be effective without the ball in his hands& Good Free Throw shooter& Elite passing skills and court vision",suns,228,https://www.reddit.com/r/suns/comments/1d1k8cx/if_luka_wins_a_ring_the_failure_of_drafting_ayton/
