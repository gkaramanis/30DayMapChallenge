2023-10-27,1698433591,27/10-2023 Hornets vs Pistons PREGAME ANALYSIS,"Both the Charlotte Hornets and the Detroit Pistons have a lot similaries so I though it would be interesting to look at these teams ahead of the game and some of their potential matchups. Im in a McDonalds bathroom as Im writing this and theres poop on the floor so Ill try to be relatively quick.

**LaMelo Ball vs Cade Cunningham:**
The star matchup. Each teams best player but I honestly dont have a lot to say. While we havent seen a lot of Cade Cunningham he looked amazing on his season debut against the Heat putting up 30/3/9/1/1. LaMelo is coming off a serious injury and Steve Clifford talked about him being a little rusty but trying to get back into rythm. In his season debut against the Hawks, Ball had 15/6/10/1/0 but did so on a pretty miserable 4/15 (although all of his makes were 3s so while still bad it isnt as bad as it looks from an efficiency standpoint) but unlike Cade he was actually able to get the job done and lead his team to win. Even if LaMelo has a poor scoring night hes easily our best option at the 1 spot. His playmaking is just so good and our entire offense runs through him. The Hornets offensive system completely falls apart without his presence. Both LaMelo and Cade arent exactly the strongest defenders so they could both definelty go off tonight.

**Brandon Miller:**
After a bumpy Summer League and Preseason he has started this season on fire. In 25 minutes off the bench he recorded 13 points, 3 rebounds and 2 assists against the Atlanta Hawks. He shot 3/7 from 3 (42.9%) and hit both of his 2-pointers. Not only was he efficient but he was clutch too as he scored 8 crucial points and almost single handedly reclaimed our lead so we could eventually beat the Hawks. Most poeple have already said it but Ill say it too, we would not have won that game without him. Its pretty much impossible to predict how hell do tonight as the sample size is far too low and rookies tend to be very inconsistent but as long as he hits his 3s there is not much else he really needs to do.

**Mark Williams vs Jalen Duren:**
This will be an interesting matchup because as most of you know Jalen Duren was actually drafted by us with the 13th pick the same year as Mark Williams, he was of course quickly traded to the Pistons. Both players have almost identical games on offense but their defense differs from each other quite a lot. In my opinion Mark Williams is a far better defender. Last year we immediately went from one of the worst defenses in the league to one of the best once he became our starter, his impact on that end of the floor was insane. Jalen Duren however looked far more inexperienced on that end, he definetly has potential and did have his moments but he was overall very inconsistent as a defender. While not the best stat, Duren had a negative DBPM and averaged 1.3 blocks per 36 minutes compared to Marks 2.0. Also while the sample size isnt very big the Detroit Pistons defensive rating was actually better in the games he didnt play compared to in the games he did play. Williams defensive playstyle is also very different from Durens since Williams is far more versatile as a defender and ventures out to the perimeter far more often where he actually does suprisingly well. Williams can also play different roles on defense. Take for example Charlottes back-to-back wins against Dallas which pretty much ended their play-in hopes. In those games Mark Williams played a defensive role more similar to Giannis than a traditional Center as he was moving around more than usual and providing help defense on both the perimeter and the interior. Both Mark and Jalen put on a show in their respective opening nights with Mark Williams putting up 13/15/1/3/1 (most rebounds in the league) on 88.8% TS meanwhile Jalen Duren managed to put up 17/14/4/0/4 on 69.0% TS. I personally think Mark Williams will do well against Jalen Duren as he often does very well against shorter Centers. Bam Adebayo in his two games against Mark Williams only put up 15.5/5/5 on just 48.3% FG (no 3s even attempted) meanwhile Mark had his iconic breakout game where he recorded 18 points and 20 rebounds against Bam, completely dominating him. Another example is OKCs Jaylin Williams who in his only game against Mark (in which Jaylin played as their starting Center) wasnt able to score a single point. Mark however put up 17/13/2/2/2 on 7/7 shooting from the field in just 21 minutes. We unfortunately dont really have any data for games between Mark Williams and Jalen Duren since in the 2 games they played each other Mark only played a combined 12 minutes so this is their first true showdown.

**Terry Rozier:**
Terry is someone who might be a key player tonight as he historically does very well against the pistions. He has put up at least 20+ points in his last 5 games against the Pistons and in his last 2 seasons he has averaged 23.6/5.4/4.9/1.7/0.4 against them which is imprissive considering ALL of those stats are better than his normal ones during that span. He also played very well in his season debut against the Hawks putting up 24/5/6 on decent efficiency and was great in Preseason. I could definetly see him going off and being a key player in tonights game.

**Conclusion:**
I think the Hornets will come out on top but its difficult to say since the Pistons are one of the few teams with players more inconsistent on offense than the Hornets. The main advantage I think the Hornets have against the Pistons is on the defensive end. While time will tell, Mark Williams and Steve Clifford seem to have turned our defense around. Coach Clifford is also often able to squeeze as much defense as possible out of his players. If you look at who played for the Pistons on their opening I dont know if there are any players I feel 100% confident saying are above average at defense for their position. Ausar Thompson had 5 blocks in his debut but he has literally only played 1 game, Jalen Duren might have taken a jump but while he was decent for a rookie hes just too young and the rest are pretty much whatever. Isaiah Stewart has had very solid defensive impact for the Pistons ever since he came in to the league so Id say him but there are a lot of good defensive Power Forwards and Centers in the league. Therefore, like I previously said I have the Hornets beating the Pistons with realtive ease but I can defiently see the Pistons putting up a fight if everything falls in to place for them or if LaMelo has another hyper-inefficient night.",CharlotteHornets,15,https://www.reddit.com/r/CharlotteHornets/comments/17huxdf/27102023_hornets_vs_pistons_pregame_analysis/

2024-02-11,1707645358,What Future Do You See In The Current Rotation,"With the trade deadline coming to an end, the majority of Charlotte Hornet fans were excited in the return we got for Pj and Hayward. Although it has been only one game with the new roster, do you believe everyone is here to stay? Also, how do you think the front office will take on the upcoming draft picks from 2024-2027? If the roster stays the same until our 2027 draft with 3 1sts, wont that effect the timeline of our roster as a whole?",CharlotteHornets,17,https://www.reddit.com/r/CharlotteHornets/comments/1ao4kdq/what_future_do_you_see_in_the_current_rotation/

2024-02-08,1707361950,Our Sideline Out of Bounds Plays - What is Going on?,"Am I crazy or do we legitimately have the absolute worst sideline out of bounds plays Ive ever seen in my life? 

I dont watch a ton of basketball outside of the first half of the Hornets anymore, but it doesnt seem like other teams have such a hard time inbounding the ball from that position on the floor?

Obviously Cliff will be gone after this season, but this one boggles my mind even for the Hornets.",CharlotteHornets,9,https://www.reddit.com/r/CharlotteHornets/comments/1alltea/our_sideline_out_of_bounds_plays_what_is_going_on/

2023-12-28,1703797871,Why does JT Thor continue to get minutes?,"Not a Hornets fan so I admittedly dont watch the Hornets (unless they are playing the Cavs) but I check box scores every game and notice JT Thor gets consistent minutes off the bench. I know hes fallen out of the rotation the last couple games since Cody Martin has come back, but looking at his box score numbers each game, it would always puzzle me why he sees the floor. Ive heard people rave about his defensive ability but the Hornets have a defensive rating two points worse when hes on the court. I also understand developing young players on a non-contending team, but hes regressed each year in both counting and advanced stats. Unless he brings something to the court that just doesnt show up anywhere statistically, what justifies him being in the rotation?",CharlotteHornets,30,https://www.reddit.com/r/CharlotteHornets/comments/18t4o31/why_does_jt_thor_continue_to_get_minutes/

As a hardcore bama fan I would be over the moon if we took Mark Sears. I see him as a Jalen Brunson kinda player who really took his game to the next level this past season. Plus, for a pick that late, couldn't hurt to pair him back up with Brandon.

On top of that, someone's gonna take Bronny, anyone think it's gonna be us?

2023-12-21,1703179635,James Plowright (@British_Buzz) Im not sure what stands out more? - Indiana shooting FG 61% - The Pacers having 37 assists - Charlottes 0 blocks - Indianas 70 bench points,I know Lamelo and Mark are out but this is just ridiculous. I really cant wait for the day this team gets serious about playing some defense at an NBA level again.

As someone who's entire Hornets experience has always had the beloved Eric and Dell and Ashley on the commentary, I'm curious as to what happens when you go see a game live?

I've always thought that the game would be missing a pretty nice element, if you cannot hear the analysis while watching -- tbh as a Hornets fan, Eric and Dell are 50% why I watch the full games and not just the condensed versions.

I guess you could always tune in to the League Pass audio, while in the arena watching, but I'd expect there to be a pretty decent delay that would make it unworkable.

Does the arena have it's own feed you can tune into? That is not delayed?

2024-10-07,1728263530,Spectrum's Bag Policy Execution Tonight ,"Just very curious to see what folks thoughts are to the new(?) no bag policy that was implemented tonight? I understand it was changed in order to reduce wait times and having to x-ray all of the bags, but not sure when or if it was even changed recently as I don't recall getting any kind of notice. The wallet-bag I took to countless events at the arena last season was ""too big"" although I measured it with a tape measure before I left home. It was 4x6.25x1.25 - so yeah I guess that's on me. 

We were so excited for the new season and to watch the team tonight but my first interaction before even stepping foot in the area was staff going out of their way to flag me down and aggressively tell me ""I can't bring that in"" and waving around a tiny snack size plastic bag in my face as a measuring guide. As I walked away to go drop my wallet off I was stopped 2 separate times by staff for them to tell me the same thing. We walked past 3 entrances and I saw staff hunting down folks hundreds of feet away from the area to tell them their bags arent allowed and waving the baggies around like flags. Not many hellos, smiles, or niceties. I also watched countless people turned away and bottlenecked at the entries with what they thought were acceptable mini bags, clutches and wallets. Once inside almost everyone seated around me at the game was visibly upset and talking about how annoyed/confused they were about it all. It was a bit comical watching folks walk in with their hands full of personal items (including myself lol)

Is this a big deal? Not at all, and the rules are the rules...but from what I saw it just didn't feel like a great way to greet fans for the first game of the season and it definitely didn't seem to create a welcoming atmosphere. Policy be damned, the execution didn't feel good.

Honestly, we do not have the best options remaining. Aside from players like Precious Achiuwa, there are not many options

Lonnie Walker would be a good name to get. Really good scorer off the bench.

Don't mind swinging for Dominick Barlow either. Hoping that he develops.

The last name I have is the most intriguing: **Evan Fournier**.

 Our young French rookie, Tidjane Salaun, is quoted to have looked up to Evan Fournier as an inspiration: https://www.thecharlottepost.com/news/2024/06/26/hornets/charlotte-hornets-pick-tidjane-sala-n-at-no.-6/

\----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

In the heart of Charlotte, the Hornets were on fire, fueled by the dynamic trio of Miles Bridges, Brandon Miller, and Lamelo Ball. The team had reached the NBA Finals, facing their long-standing rivals, the Boston Celtics. The series was tied 3-3, and it all came down to a thrilling Game 7 at the Spectrum Center.

From the tip-off, the game was intense, with both teams trading baskets. Bridges and Miller were dominating on both ends of the court, scoring at will and shutting down the Celtics' offense. But it was Lamelo Ball who stole the show. He was everywhere, grabbing rebounds, dishing out assists, and scoring with finesse.

As the game entered the fourth quarter, the Hornets found themselves trailing by two points. With seconds left on the clock, Ball drove to the basket, drawing a foul and sinking both free throws to tie the game. With the score tied, the game went into overtime.

In overtime, it was Bridges who took charge, scoring a series of clutch baskets to give the Hornets a slim lead. With time running out, Miller made a crucial steal, leading to a fast break that ended with Ball throwing down a thunderous dunk, sealing the victory for the Hornets.

As the final buzzer sounded, the Spectrum Center erupted in celebration. The Hornets had won their first championship in franchise history, with Ball putting up a historic quadruple-double, Bridges dominating on both ends, and Miller coming up clutch when it mattered most. It was a moment that would be remembered for years to come, as the Hornets proved that they were truly a team to be reckoned with.",CharlotteHornets,19,https://www.reddit.com/r/CharlotteHornets/comments/1bad8tx/i_take_my_bow/

As such, I'm pretty ignorant to our earlier history during the Bobcats era. I'm a listener of All the Smoke, and during the Charles Barkley episode, Stephen Jackson said that he was disappointed how the team traded him after he led them to the playoffs in 2010.

This obviously confuses me since Jackson wasn't ever an All-Star like Kemba. Was he really that talented that he was able to carry the team to the playoffs, even if it was a first round exit?",CharlotteHornets,90,https://www.reddit.com/r/CharlotteHornets/comments/196m83x/older_hornetsbobcats_fans_is_it_true_stephen/

I see some fans are holding out hope to make the play-in tourney once the roster returns to full health. I've pretty much given up on that from a timing perspective. By the time we get fully healthy the trade deadline will be right around the corner.

My hope is they move Rozier, Hayward and Bridges for players/picks. LaMelo, Miller, Mark all stay healthy and we see a competitive team down the stretch. I know some fans are holding out play-in hope, but I don't see that happening.

2024-06-08,1717884056,"What type of team is CHA currently? Rebuilding, No Man's Land, or Potential Playoff Team (Current Roster considering)?","**I ask because many NBA fans seem to think that CHA is currently in rebuild mode.  Do you guys agree or no?**

Me personally, I say no. The Rozier, Hayward, and Washington trade(s), and with the new ownership being behind some of these moves confirmed to me that we were no longer rebuilding, we are stacked with some talented pieces on our roster (IMO). We basically cut off the dead weight when it came to those trades.

*A team that may be in No Man's Land would be a team like the* ***Nets.***

Also, with the draft coming up, I can see us getting a big and another wing player if they decide to decline the option on Thor's contract. Poku may be back next season? Bertans (the great shooter) may or may not be back next season. But besides those guys and how the lineups may be:

Starting Lineup:

PG: Melo

SG: Martin or Mann

SF: Miller

PF: Bridges (If they resign him)

C: M. Williams

Backup:

PG: Micic

SG: Mann or Martin

SF: Curry

PF: C. Williams

C: Richards

Third String:

PG: NSJ

SG: Mcgowens

SF: New Draftee

PF: Bertans (if they keep his contract) or Poku

C: New Draftee

**What is our ceiling for next season with the new coach who comes from a winning organization? I predict a 40-game win next season. We make it past the play-ins but we can't get past the first round of playoffs for the 2024 - 2025 season. Would you say we win more than 40 games or less with the way our roster is (and also considering the potential lineups for next season)?**",CharlotteHornets,77,https://www.reddit.com/r/CharlotteHornets/comments/1dbdyth/what_type_of_team_is_cha_currently_rebuilding_no/

Lots of role players with very niche games to fill in gaps on rosters.

I'm intrigued if he can do that as Lee comes from teams that want 5 out line ups. He's young enough he could grow a little too. That would be a fun lineup as he has the body and seems to be a decent rebounder and hustles. ,CharlotteHornets,11,https://www.reddit.com/r/CharlotteHornets/comments/1e2qy8l/salaun_at_the_5/

2024-02-14,1707911744,What happened to next year's 1st round pick. And what are the implications?,"According to Google Bard, the Spurs currently own Hornet's 2024. But it's 1-14 protected.

Then Bard says, the Hornets are incentivized to make playoffs, so that the pick turns into a 2nd round pick for the Spurs. 

That doesn't sound right. Seems like the language model is confidently wrong as usual.

Can I get help clarifying the implications of what happens if the Hornets make/miss playoffs. Basically, I want to know, is there any point in tanking this season?",CharlotteHornets,20,https://www.reddit.com/r/CharlotteHornets/comments/1aql5td/what_happened_to_next_years_1st_round_pick_and/

2023-12-09,1702127671,Terry Rozier in his 5 games as the Hornets starting Point Guard: 23/4/9 on 43/37/95 shooting splits,"Terry Rozier as the starting PG has been wild so far. He has done a suprisingly good job as a distributor and the offense hasnt been a problem for the Hornets as of late as they have had an offensive rating of 117.2 during this stretch. The only real major issue with Terry on the offensive end has been his inconsistency. These are his statlines from his last 5 games:

11/2/5/1/0 shooting 5-16 FG, 0-3 3P and 1-1 FT in a loss against the Knicks

37/4/13/2/0 shooting 13-25 FG, 7-9 3P and 4-4 FT in a win against the Nets

23/6/7/2/0 shooting 8-20 FG, 3-7 3P and 4-5 FT in a loss against the Timberwolves

25/5/7/1/2 shooting 10-24 FG, 1-11 3P and 4-4 FT in a loss against the Bulls

21/2/13/0/0 shooting 7-15 FG, 2-5 3P and 5-5 FT in a win against the Raptors

Our issue as of late hasnt been our offense, it has been our rebounding and defense. I guess Terry deserves some of that blame as hes a bad defender but its not like LaMelo Ball was playing elite defense. Im not saying Terry at PG has been ideal, Im just saying it hasnt been nearly as bad as we were expecting.",CharlotteHornets,19,https://www.reddit.com/r/CharlotteHornets/comments/18edd4t/terry_rozier_in_his_5_games_as_the_hornets/

2024-05-18,1716060451,Early Hornets Big Board: Fits I like for Dah Bugz,"The draft is coming up and even though this is a perceived weak class there are some scenarios of players we can get that I'm very excited about and I'm curious what you guys think.

**Tier 1A:** Reed Sheppard

I'm heads over heels in love with the idea of Sheppard in Charlotte. I think our two biggest needs as a team right now first and foremost a point-of-attack/off-ball guard defender and not close behind that in second a guard that has some explosive ability on offense to both play next to and takes on ball handling duties without LaMelo. I feel that Reed was borderline made in a lab to address those needs. 

Let's start on offense. Sheppard is a marksman. The guy shot above 50% from three for the duration of the season on 4 attempts a game. He also has a smooth quick release that will allow him to be able to get his shot off against NBA-level defense in my opinion. 

He also showed the ability to play both on and off the ball and thrive with a number of different guards with different skill sets at Kentucky. 

He also showed extremely highly basketball character in accepting an extremely underserved bench role without ever complaining at Kentucky when frankly he was the best player on the team. He shows some juice as a playmaker he averaged 4.5 assists per game in just 29 minutes off the bench with a lot of those minutes being spent off the ball. 

Multiple guard lineups are all the rage these days but it's a lot more complicated than just sticking two guys together and saying you can never have enough playmaking See Garland and Mitchell in Cleveland and Young and Murray in Atlanta.

Reed I feel fits seamlessly in the best-case scenario of LaMelo being a healthy ball-dominant All-Star and also provides nice insurance for the scenario where LaMelo remains unhealthy.

Now for defense, this is an interesting discussion.

From appearances alone, Sheppard looks like a nightmare on defense. He is only 6'3"" with a 6'3"" wingspan. He is not a very explosive athlete laterally (we will get to his vertical later). But simply writing off Reed based on that is a mistake.

The guy is maybe the best hustle defensive stat player I have ever seen. He averaged 2.5 steals per game off the bench at his size and even more absurdly averaged nearly one block per game at .7.

That's where that 42-inch vertical comes into play. He had 2 fewer blocks on the season than Kentucky's starting center. Sheppard hustles like hell off of the ball and reads passing lanes exceptionally. 

He can be exposed in 1 on 1 situations by size and speed to such an extent that he will never make an all-defense team but he's far from a liability in total on defense and is any many ways an asset. He brings an effort and intensity to that side that we really lack.  


While he does lack the elite physical traits of a plus defender, he certainly punches above his weight and is an upgrade to anything that we have had at the position in quite some time.

As far as making a comparison, I think Fred VanVellet on the Raptors is a similar mold to what I think Reed can be here.

FVV started off as a UDFA who slowly made his way up the Raptors rotation.

FVV is even smaller than Sheppard at 6'0"". But, he also is a player that punches above his weight defensively.

While he was their backup point guard behind their All-Star in Kyle Lowry, FVV also became an excellent off-the-ball player there, especially during their title run.

Sadly, I think there is a good chance Sheppard is off of the board by the time we get to pick 6.

There is some downside of him being a tweener who is neither a truly explosive player at the point guard position and too small to be a high impact at the 2. In that scenario, I think his career could follow somewhat of a Luke Kennard, Grayson Allen arc.

But I absolutely love this pick and am rushing it in if I am Jeff Peterson and he's on the board at 6.

**Tier 1: Stephon Castle**

Not gonna lie, I came into this wanting to hate Castle. I looked at him as a non-shooter, who was riding the hype of a UConn team that won the title and thought that his desire of being a more ball dominant player was unfounded.

But as I've looked into him I've gotten really comfortable with him being the guy at 6.

Starting with the positives, as I said earlier, the Hornets' biggest need to me is a point-of-attack defender at the guard position and Stephon Castle is that guy.

He showed amazing defensive chops at UConn and was trusted with some of the toughest assignments in major games. He's 6'6"" got good size for his age at 19 in 210 pounds and a 6'9"" wingspan.

To have the defensive presence and acumen he did for a team more focused on winning the title than it was at developing NBA talent at his age was highly impressive.

I think he can guard both guards and wings at his size and do both at a higher level than Sheppard approaching that all-defense ceiling.

The offense is where his age did show he very much looked like a freshman at times with just inconsistencies throughout his game.

 His jump shooting was sporadic at best and more often than not just poor. He only shot 26.7% from 3.

He did get hot at times and is a decent free throw shooter at 75% so while hope is not lost on that end. Banking on him being a good shooter in the next 2-3 years is far from a guarantee.

Castle is adamant that he has more juice with the ball in his hands than he showed at UConn and wants more opportunities to play the 1 in the NBA.

While his offensive profile would concern me greatly if I were a team building around him as my lead guard. I do think that playing with LaMelo and Brandon will give him the space to add a little more juice to his game while not having too much creation responsibility.

This comparison is a lot more friendly than it sounds but I think a possible deluxe version of Nickeil Alexander-Walker for the Timberwolves could be the mold for Castle. Great defender that has more guard skills on offense than you typically get from someone who can defend 1-3 but not enough guard skill to really be happy if he was ever your lead guard.

If LaMelo can stay healthy, I do really like the idea of him coming along slowly as the defensive connective tissue and connector on offense in between LaMelo and Bradon.

**Tier 2: Donavan Clingan, Nikola Topic**

I am decidedly less excited about both of these options than the first two but there are some things to like.

Clingan could come in immediately and I feel replicate the role that Brook Lopez and Kristaps Porzingis played as drop coverage rim protectors for Charles Lee in Milwaukee and Boston.

He also shows some nice traits as a passer which could carry over from the things Boston's does with KP and Al Horford.

I think Clingan could be worth it even if we have confidence that Mark Williams' back injury will be fine in the long term. Look at Dallas with Gafford and Livley; their ability to have that caliber of center play at all times is a huge asset.

Downside for Clingan is he's a very poor free throw shooter and will be a hack-a-shaq target more than likely/

His upside on offense really isn't there, it's really a what you see is what you get proposition.

Topic, if we take him it's really getting into a best player available proposition because I really do not love the fit here.

He's a very high IQ player, and shows some really nice crafty traits and tricks of the trade. He's played at a high level professionally as a teen all of which are great.

However, I think he really does lack zip and explosiveness with the ball in his hands, he's a pretty stiff and rigid mover that kinda plays like he's stuck in one gear on offense. He struggled to shoot the ball only making 26 threes in 22 games.

That lack of explosiveness shows on defense as well where I found him be pretty poor.

He is a good free throw shooter so there is possibly some upside to the jump shot. He's a very smart player who I do think takes good angles and does crafty things to get to the rim and get downhill and playmaker for others so I do see how he can at least develop that out to the mid-range area.

He reminds me a lot of Josh Giddey, who is currently a bad fit with SGA and Jalen Williams, two players that I view as a very good blueprint of how I would like to see the team be built around LaMelo and Brandon.

On the high side of outcomes for Topic, I could see Goran Dragic on the Heat and possibly even a little bit of Franz Wagner, and I do think he is the best choice if the first three choices are off the board.

2024-04-15,1713154187,"We know our #2 pick is gonna be great, but how do you guys feel about NSJ?","I was personally impressed by what weve seen from him. For a 27th pick, I think he shows a ton of promise. Hell obviously need to improve his defense and add a little to his scoring game, but his shot looks great. 

Statistically, he reminds me of a rookie Devonte Graham, but with a much better shot. 42% from 3 and 87% from the line (in a very small sample) bodes very well. He could be the top tier sniper many good teams have but ours has lacked. To really be effective, hell need to improve inside and round his game out in a way Devonte never could. 

What do you guys think? How do you see him developing and what do you think could be his role on this team? How high is his ceiling? Could he be a sixth man, high-scoring combo guard, or do you see him possibly starting?

2023-12-14,1702573225,Hayward - Beyond the slump,"I was thinking that Gordon's November slump is skewing the perception of just how well he's been playing this season on the whole.  It seems pretty clear that he pinged his hamstring in the 11/12 NYK game, missed a game, and then 5 of his following 6 games were rather poor (but showed up for Boston). I'm not sure if the hamstring was slowing him down, but it seems fairly likely, given how stark the differences are before and after that slump.

First 8 games: 18.6 PPG, 5.8 RB, 5.6 AST, 1.9 STL  / 48% FG, 41% 3P, 70% FT

Slump: 7.1 PPG, 4.7 RB, 3.4 AST, 0.4 STL / 29% FG, 20% 3P, 75% FT

Last 6 games: 21.2 PPG, 4.3 RB, 5.2 AST, 1.2 STL / 60% FG, 47% 3P, 88% FT

Combined, minus the slump: 19.7 PPG, 5,1 RB, 5.4 AST, 1.6 STL / 60% FG, 47% 3P, 88% FT

I wouldn't normally suggest cherry picking good games vs bad games like that, but when it's a chunk like that right around an injury, I tend to think his reality is a bit closer to the first 8 and last 6 games. Not to suggest he's actually a 60/47/88 shooter, but I think his true splits as a player are still likely no worse than his recent best seasons. Some other things of note:

\- His FGA per game is not materially different during any of these periods. He's not shooting more with Ball out. It's 13-14 FGA on great efficiency.

\- Something that's fairly promising is the fact that he's already got 13 dunks this season. To put that in perspective, he's totalled 21, 19, and 16 the previous three seasons.  That would put him on pace for 48 on the season, which would be the most since his last season in Utah and at least 20 more than any season since.  He's even catching lobs again and it's starting to feel like a normal thing . Just seems like he's in the best physical condition since at least his 1st season in Charlotte, or 2019-2020 Boston.

So, whether you enjoy this for what it is or see at as a rising trade value, just thought it was worth mentioning.

Infact this is pretty much the only scenario where I'd be OK with letting Miles walk. We would probably need to draft a bigger wing/4 if this happens. Probably rule out the Reeds and Castles in the draft.

I'd be willing to give Monk 4/100M. I think he's really good and his playmaking ability has reached another level.

2024-02-22,1708637669,22/2-2024 Hornets vs Jazz PREGAME ANALYSIS,"**Charlotte Hornets 3-0 since trade deadline:** The Charlotte Hornets have gone on a 3 game win streak since their trades at the end of the deadline kicked in. Pretty much all of their new additions have been excellent. Grant Williams is averaging 17.0 PPG and 7.3 RPG on a super efficient 64.7% TS. Tre Mann is their new starting point guard and is playing like it with him averaging  13.7/7.0/7.3 to go along with 1.3 SPG and 56.4% TS. Vasalije Mici is the backup point guard and is averaging 11.0 PPG and 6.0 APG on 61.7% TS in just 22.3 MPG. Seth Curry is averaging 10.0 PPG on 65.6% TS in just 18.7 MPG. Davis Bertans hasnt been playing as well as the other guys but he shot 3-5 from 3 in his first game and has been a great 3-point shooter his entire career. Hopefully the new additions keep subverting expectations and keep their momentum going.

**Should Cody Martin still be starting?:** Cody Martin still being a starter despite the new additions has seen a lot of criticism from fans on social media. Him starting made a lot of sense before the deadline as the Hornets needed playmaking and thats his best offensive quality but should he still be starting? Hes one of the best defenders on the team but he doesnt really have the same offensive talent as honestly everyone else in the regular rotation, he has honestly been one of the worst scorers in the entire league this season.

**Utah Jazz struggling:** Despite the Utah Jazz having what seemed like a comeback to save the season they have struggled lately and are currently on a 4 game losing streak. Their former All-Star power forward Lauri Markkanen has averaged 19.3 PPG on mediocre 40/36/100 shooting splits during these 4 games. Maybe tonight well see him returning to form?

**New addition Marques Bolden:** Dont know how much this will affect tonights game but its worth mentioning. The Hornets havent really had a backup center for the last 3 games and have just ran 66"" Grant Williams as a PF/C. Marques Bolden is an actual center and while he wasnt exactly dominating in the G-League he was still contributing to winning basketball before the Hornets signed him. He has the ability to hit the occasional C&amp;S 3 which is more of an offensive outside game than any of our other centers and fits the Hornets current theme. Dont know how his defense will translate to the NBA but it was servicable in the G-League and his overall game should translate better than Mensahs.",CharlotteHornets,13,https://www.reddit.com/r/CharlotteHornets/comments/1axig5o/2222024_hornets_vs_jazz_pregame_analysis/

2023-12-18,1702870241,Patience,"What we need rn is patience, we dont need a trade to get us five more wins on the season or a coach that will get us five more wins on the season. We need consistency in our roster, and our defensive schemes. Once our younger guys get used to the system (and we finally get healthy)>, I feel we can be a good team going into next year. 

Weve seen flashes of what this team can be when everything clicks and I believe that version of our team has a lot of potential. 
we should then try to look for our Steve Kerr and our big trade to push us over the edge.

2023-11-22,1700682776,22/11-2023 Hornets vs Wizards PREGAME ANALYSIS,"**The Hornets chance at their first win streak:**
After an amazing display against the Boston Celtics, the Charlotte Hornets now have a chance to get their first back-to-back win. The Washington Wizards are one of the few teams in the league who not only have a worse record than the Hornets but also a worse net rating. Despite missing Terry Rozier and Nick Richards, the Hornets should definetly beat the Wizards tonight.

**Mark Williams, the potential X-factor:**
Its no secret that Mark Williams has been playing well this season. In just 26.6 minutes per game he is averaging a statline of 13.8/10.0/1.5/0.9/0.8 while leading the leading the league in FG%, eFG% and TS%. He continues to be a good defender as he consistently improves the Hornets defense from pretty much everywhere on the court. He is also fresh off of a monster performance against Boston where he put up a statline of 18/16/2/1/3 and had the game high +/- of +33. 

The Wizards are a perfect matchup for Mark Williams as he is good at utilizing his length and does an amazing job controlling the boards against weaker rebounding teams. This was evident in the Hornets last two games against the Wizards. In the first one he only played 18 minutes likely due to foul trouble, the Wizards quickly blowing out the Hornets and just some strange coaching decisions by Clifford but he was incredibly efficient in those 18 minutes. He managed to record 14 points on a perfect 5-5 shooting, 7 rebounds and 1 block. He also had the highest +/- out of anyone on this team other than NSJ and Leaky Black who only played 4 minutes that were in garbage time. In the second game he managed to record 21 points and 24 rebounds and set a new franchise record for the Hornets. He had the most offensive rebounds by anyone in Charlotte Hornets history with 15! Daniel Gafford actually did good job defending Mark Williams 1-on-1 but that really didnt matter since Mark could just grab his miss and get infininte chances. He also had a team high +/- of +19 that game. With Nick Richards still out Mark Williams get a lot of playing time. In his past 3 games he has played more minutes in each game than any other game this season. Everything seems to be in favour of Mark having another monster performance.

**LaMelo Ball:**
I will be quick as there isnt a lot to say other than that LaMelo Ball is amazing. In his last 8 games hes averaging an MVP-caliber statline of 32.0/6.1/8.5/1.5/0.4 and doing so on 63% TS. The guy is insane, he has the worst stretch of his career (he had good reasons but still) and then immediatly follows it up with a 30 point Triple-Double and the best stretch of his career. Praying that this insane stretch continues.

**Miles Bridges:**
It feels weird to talk about him. I honestly dont care about anyones opinion on his situation so Im just gonna skip over it. Hes on the team now and thats that. I do have to admit that despite how I feel about him he is an incredible basketball player. In his first 3 games this season, he is averaging a statline of 16.7/8.0/4.0/1.3/0.3 and has a TS% of 57.8%. In his last game he actually only shot 3-13 from the field but hit a crucial 3, hit all 6 of his free throws, recorded 15 rebounds and 5 assists. He will likely be the biggest difference between our 2 prior games against Washington and this one as outside of him just being a reallly good scorer he is also a pretty good playmaker for a PF and one of the Hornets better defenders.",CharlotteHornets,6,https://www.reddit.com/r/CharlotteHornets/comments/181i0ir/22112023_hornets_vs_wizards_pregame_analysis/

IT'S DRAFT DAY! The purpose of this mega thread is for centralized chat and discussion of anything related to this event, including fan-proposed trades, rather than countless self posts or trade machine images/links which really don't need their own threads.

Posts/articles from media or other reputable sources regarding the draft can still be posted as their own threads, this is primarily for draft commentary and trade ideas by fans; before, during and after the event. If you have a high quality text submission, go for it.

2024-06-03,1717374063,Could it make sense to be buyers in this draft? ,"Hear me out. The draft lottery is full of sellers this year. The narrative is that its a weak draft, and while that may be true, there will inevitably be productive NBA players in this draft. Weve scouted well and have picked good players with most lottery picks. 

*If* the Hornets could acquire another lottery pick at a good price and *if* their scouting indicates someone else is worth picking, why not take a second shot at rounding out the roster with prospects on guaranteed longterm contracts? Weve got roster space, cap space, and need NBA-quality depth. This draft could be a unique opportunity to acquire high picks at a relative low cost to most years. 

If our front office feels Sheppard and Clingan/Holland are worth $8 million and $6 million/year contracts, why not trade a protected 2027/2028 first or something? We need to stop operating as a team that assumes itll be in the lottery for another 8 straight years anyways. We have Miller/LaMelo and a small handful of supporting players, but need to start the clock on building a team around them finally.

2024-03-10,1710070930,"Hornet's fan, why don't you feel optimistic about being competitive again in the near future ?","Every time I spend some times in this sub, it gives me the feeling that the franchise is undergoing a very long process and is far from being successful again and I don't understand why.

With LaMelo and Miller, it seems that the franchise can rely on two tangible perennial all-stars. Bridges and Williams are solids #3 and #4 pieces and have good trading values if needed. This roster will add this summer another solid young prospect. I don't buy the weak draft projection and I see either in Dillingham, Risacher or Sarr a strong potential addition to your core team. Maybe not all-stars but definitely top 4 options. 

Compared to the Piston, Wizards situation you are in a far better place. I love Barnes and the last trades but I don't see a reason to be more optimistic about Raptor's future than for Charlotte. Nets, Hawks and Bulls futures are blurry. Jimmy Butler is 34 years old and I'm pretty sure in a near future Embiid will move from Philly. 

Overall even without doing anything special I don't see how the franchise doesn't manage to comeback in the top 8. With a little bit of luck with Lamelo, Miller and another top pick you can easily be a top 6 or top 4 team. 

Did I miss something or is it just normal phenomenon for Hornets fan not being optimistic due to lack of results since Jordan ownership ?

2024-09-14,1726319284,Are we a chance for Cooper Flagg?,"Obviously nobody here should get ahead of themselves, but does it feel like we're too good for Flagg or a top 3 pick? 

What is everyones perfect 2024-2025 season?

Personally, if we could have a nice start to the season, instil a culture of effort and high defensive intensity, then by trade deadline move some pieces and slow down a bit that is ideal. It sucks, but we do need to artificially decline the roster. Moving Micic to the Nuggets, Nick Richards to the Knicks or maybe Cody Martin to a team needing a 3/D guy for picks is ideal. It's nothing that's not replaceable, but they're guys who could fetch some draft capital while slowing down winning without losing culture. 

With how poor Portland, Washington, New Jersey and Utah are looking and trying to be I think we'll probably float around that 5-10 range in the lottery. Which does suck, but just being in contention is a big thing. 

Totally understand if anyone disagrees, is sick of losing and just wants a playoff season. But personally, I would rather be in contention for a franchise alterer like Flagg or Ace Bailey than getting bounced in the play-in or 1st round.

2023-11-24,1700830485,Who is this teams most likely trade piece?,"Let's assume Terry returns in the next 2 or 3 games. And health for the most part across the team, is a non issue. The Hornets near mid season and trade deadline and are in playoff contention. Who do you see as the most likely piece to be moved? Is it still Gordon? Does Richards have good enough value to move? Thor? With the lack of depth being shown in his absence, I doubt Terry goes anywhere unless it's a busted season. 

I'm surprised Nick hasn't been talked about for his value. He's a double double machine with the right minutes. Is he better suited as a Williams backup or could be find a partner in need of his skillset?",CharlotteHornets,48,https://www.reddit.com/r/CharlotteHornets/comments/182rhco/who_is_this_teams_most_likely_trade_piece/

2024-02-08,1707366833,Everyone is aware Miles is playing this year after a full year off of competitive basketball? He's outperforming everyone including this subs expectations this year. I think as a fanbase we are a little too hard on him right now.,"Some rust was expected.

He's looked like he lost some explosiveness but he also was away from the team and nba trainers for a full off-season. There's a very decent chance he regains some explosiveness, he may never be 21 year old springy Miles again but he will be in better shape after a full off-season with the team.

This diminished explosiveness has hurt his ability to finish at the rim and therefore his 2p% but his outside shooting is better with more volume than the last time he played. (36.9% on 6.7 attempts per game) We also have to remember that was Borrego offense which we can all agree was easier to score and play in. He also had a real point guard.

I just think collectively as fans we are a little too down on Miles right now. He's always taken responsibility for his bad play on the court and there is definitely a decent chance he improves on this year in the future. I also think some of the warts with his iso offense wouldn't be so pronounced with our full lineup. He can definitely play within an offense.",CharlotteHornets,34,https://www.reddit.com/r/CharlotteHornets/comments/1alnd2r/everyone_is_aware_miles_is_playing_this_year/

&gt; PJ Washington is another Hornets forward whos commanding inquiries from rival teams, with Dallas among the interested suitors, sources said. Over this past weekend, the Clippers purported pursuit of Washington became noted across the league. But according to various league personnel involved in these talks, Los Angeles has not had a meaningful conversation with Charlotte in quite some time about Washington. One source went so far as to describe that Clippers-Washington connection as bad info.",CharlotteHornets,24,https://www.reddit.com/r/CharlotteHornets/comments/1ajo12u/fischer_pj_washington_is_commanding_inquiries/

&gt; So in summary: An ad agency commissioned two 19-foot-tall Hugo the Hornets to go on billboards near Uptown Charlotte a decade ago.

They then sat there for nine years before anyone other than curious urban explorers noticed them.

2024-02-27,1709045802,Hollinger examine's Charlotte Defensive Turnaround,"[Article Link](https://theathletic.com/5300364/2024/02/26/charlotte-hornets-defense-nba-jaylon-tyson-cal/?source=freedailyemail&amp;campaign=601983&amp;userId=712837)

I've long been a fan of Hollinger. It's nice to see the Hornets getting some national publicity. It's behind a paywall, but I posted the link and have pasted what I think are the most interesting parts...

""It was the Hornets fifth win in six games & after winning only 10 games all season before the trade deadline. They also ended decade-plus losing streaks in both Utah and Portland this past week.

Charlottes defense ranked last in the [NBA](https://theathletic.com/nba/) at the deadline, giving up an impossible 121.8 points per 100 possessions. Since the Hornets reconstituted their roster Feb. 10, they are, unbelievably, n*umero uno,* allowing a meager 99.9 per 100. They held one opponent under 100 points in their first 53 games & and have done it three times in their last four.

So, the obvious questions: What is happening? Why? And can this be sustainable going forward as the Hornets embark on their 17th rebuild (give or take) in 20 seasons since their rebirth?

In terms of this recent defensive U-turn, obvious caveats apply beyond the small sample of six games. First and foremost, the funhouse mirror that is opponent 3-point shooting distorts defensive results to the point that it can be difficult to tell whats real and whats a mirage. To wit, Charlotte opponents have shot 9 of 50 on corner 3s in this stretch, Jedi defense that has zero predictive value, and only 28.2 percent on above-the-break 3s. Theyre at 32 percent on wide-open 3s and 22 percent on open 3s this stretch; both figures lead the league.

The Hornets also have played some teams that were, to put it kindly, not peaking...On the other hand & even allowing for the placebo that is 3-point variance, this has been quite a turnaround for the Hornets on defense. The restricted area defense has been solid  helped by one of the better stretches of Nick Richards young career. The Hornets arent fouling (sixth-best in this stretch), and theyre forcing turnovers (third-best, even if you subtract the Blazers playing defense on one another in the clip above). The Hornets also have been hurt by live-ball turnovers at the offensive end; the defensive stats could be even better without those run-outs.

One can point to some obvious personnel changes as the catalyst. The return of [Cody Martin](https://theathletic.com/nba/player/cody-martin-0DWeM2VXCve73fII/) from nearly two years lost to injury has been an obvious one; on Sunday, he harassed Portlands Anfernee Simons into a 4-of-21, zero-assist nightmare. Trading for [Grant Williams](https://theathletic.com/nba/player/grant-williams-ZKR4PurwehHcDFw2/) and getting healthy enough to eliminate some of the precipitous drop-offs from the bench units has also helped.

On the other hand, theres also the LaMelephant in the room. Charlottes defensive renaissance has coincided with the absence of star guard [LaMelo Ball](https://theathletic.com/nba/player/lamelo-ball-ovP4Zjm8PFLcjKlm/), the catalyst for the Hornets transition offense. Hes also been perhaps the Hornets least interested defensive player, and getting him to buy in when he returns is one of the biggest hurdles going forward.

That said, Ball has only played seven games since Thanksgiving. The Hornets defense looked awful regardless of who played for the seasons first 50 games, but Martin missed the first 26 of them and didnt really get his sea legs until recently. Williams just arrived, and while hes not P.J. Washingtons match at the offensive end, he has been hugely important to small-ball lineups on defense.""

2024-02-15,1708024885,Brandon Miller Rookie of the Month for February?,"The Hornets have played 8 out of their 12 games in February and for those 8 games Brandon Miller has averaged a statline of 23.5/5.0/2.3/1.5/1.1 on 61.7% TS with a 3-5 record. For reference he averaged 16.0/4.1/2.4/0.6/0.2 on 53.0% TS with a 2-11 record and won eastern confernce rookie of the month in January.

None of the other candidates seem to be even close to the level Brandon Miller is playing at rn. Jaime Jaquez Jr. won the other 2 eastern conference rookie of the months and he is averaging 9.6/4.6/2.3/1.0/0.0 on 47.4% TS in February, although with a 5-2 record. Ausar Thompson is averaging 11.6/6.0/1.6/1.6/0.9 on 56.0% TS with a 2-5 record. Gradey Dick is averaging 10.3 PPG on 67.1% TS in just 20.5 MPG with a 2-6 record. Bilal Coulibaly is averaging 7.9/4.4/1.4/0.6/0.4 on 45.7% TS with a 0-7 record and the fact the hes one of the top candidates shows how not close this is. Maybe Vasa Micic is one of the top candidates with him averaging 6.3 PPG and 4.7 APG on 56.3% TS with a 5-1 record this month?

1. Defensive switching.

2024-03-26,1711420423,Who do you think is replacing Steve Clifford next season?,"**What coach do you guys truly see replacing Steve Clifford?** 

&amp;#x200B;

**Available NBA Coaches according to BETMGM:** 

* **Mike Budenholzer**
* **Terry Stotts**
* **Mark Jackson**
* **Kenny Atkinson**
* **Nate McMillan**
* **Becky Hammon**
* **Stan Van Gundy**
* **Jeff Van Gundy**
* **Mike DAntoni**
* **Dwane Casey**
* **Stephen Silas**
* **Dave Joerger**
* **James Borrego**

&amp;#x200B;

**Here are the coaches I think could/should replace Steve Clifford:**

&amp;#x200B;

**-Mike Budenholzer** (Best Bucks head coach in recent years but got fired out of the blue due to not winning in a recent playoff run in which they ironically broke a new record.) 484 - 317 \[60% win perc.\] 

&amp;#x200B;

**-Terry Stotts** (Average coach at best. Think of James Borrego 2.0 but a little bit better. Recently stepped down from an assistant coaching job in the Bucks organization when Adrian Griffin was head coach at the time. Stotts definitely can turn this team around but I certainly see us in the 8th - 10th seed with Stotts being the leader for this team) 402 - 318  \[55% win perc\]

&amp;#x200B;

**-Mike D'Atonni** (Who could forget the legendary Phoenix Suns head coach from 04 - 08 season(s)? He also head coached for other teams but his days with Phoenix will forever be apart of my childhood with the way this guy coached a really good team. He was the leading candidate for the head coaching job for CHA 21-22 season but was turned down for Kenny Atkinson who later turned down the job leaving us with Steve Clifford. Is there a chance that we could get D'Atonni back or has that bridge been burned?)  672 - 527 \[56% win perc.\]

&amp;#x200B;

**-The Famous Mark Jackson** (Fans have been rooting for this man to be a head coach again for years. He's been credited by Warriors fans for turning the organization around when they got their first 50-game win season (in 2014) since '93 but still got fired despite that. The reasons he got fired are still a debatable topic to this day. Since he's not broadcasting anymore due to unfortunate reasons, he probably has the opportunity to coach again but does he still want to do it or do you think he's ready to call it quits in the basketball world?) 121 - 109 \[52% win perc.\]

&amp;#x200B;

**-Sam Cassell** (Currently an assistant coach for the Boston Celtics, a winning organization. He was also an assistant coach for other winning organizations such as the 76ers and the Clippers. Could he be an effective coach for the Hornets' young roster to turn them into actual competitors or not?)

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Finalist for the head coaching position (I pick): **Mike Budenholzer -** the dude deserves another chance and is a solid coach. If CHA is serious about being a real competitive team for seasons to come, **Mike Budenholzer** is certainly the answer.

The ankle issues have persisted and he's now dealing with ongoing soreness. It's possible he just doesn't want to battle through lingering pain with where the team is at, but regardless the organization needs to come up with a plan for him moving forward.

I'd love for them to schedule rest for him and limit his appearances in back to backs the first couple of months of next season. The challenge with that is the 65-game rule puts a lot of pressure on guys to be out there.

How do you think they should manage him going into next season?

&gt; One of the most frequent questions circulating leaguewide at the moment: Who is taking over Charlotte's basketball operations after the recent announcement from longtime executive Mitch Kupchak that hes stepping down?

&gt; League sources say Brooklyn's Jeff Peterson, New Orleans' Trajan Langdon and Minnesota's Matt Lloyd are three prime names to watch as the Hornets close in on a new lead executive to run their front office.

&gt; The Nets are said to have strong interest in trying to keep Peterson as a top aide to Sean Marks & potentially with a new title, raise, etc. Langdon has been a candidate for lead decision-maker jobs previously. Lloyd was one of Tim Connelly's first hires when Connelly started assembling his front office in Minnesota.

&gt; Peterson, of course, worked previously with one of the Hornets new co-owners (Rick Schnall) in Atlanta.",CharlotteHornets,12,https://www.reddit.com/r/CharlotteHornets/comments/1b2b9zb/stein_league_sources_say_brooklyns_jeff_peterson/

2023-11-15,1700061037,The next thing the new owners should do is invest in better strength training,"I was at the game last night and its just jarring how much thicker every heat player is compared to their hornets counterpart. I get that basically all of our wings were out but watching Mcgowens and Thor out there is just wild. They are so goddamn skinny. Do we just not have access to steroids like other teams do? Lamelo still goes up weak all the time which is a big reason he doesnt get calls. 

I understand that lifting during the year is pretty difficult, but some of it has to be on the staff. I know Jordan had one of the cheapest operations in the nba, and i am sure that these two issues are related, but we cant be the skinniest team in the nba every single year.",CharlotteHornets,22,https://www.reddit.com/r/CharlotteHornets/comments/17vvoks/the_next_thing_the_new_owners_should_do_is_invest/

He was only 5'3"" and playing competitively for 10+ years! The shortest player ever in the NBA.  Charlotte, just like Muggsy, has always been considered an underdog but we keep on showing up. We should celebrate that tiny but tough spirit.  There's enough random statues/art installations around the city where I think one of Muggsy would be a great addition.

2024-07-19,1721356183,Reminiscing ,"I would like to preface this by saying I am absolutely zooted and tooted, so this may be pretty stupid, but I find it hilarious.

I absolutely love Cody Zeller.  I was just watching this 2015 season highlight video of his [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rcqavYIvwWQ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rcqavYIvwWQ) . It is asbolutely amazing overall, but from 7:25 to 7:30 of the video is the best in my opinion. This is due to the faint yell of ""GRAB IT!"" in the background by Steve Clifford.

I have no idea how you would do this without dedicating way too much time/effort to it, but a compilation of Steve Clifford yelling ""GRAB IT!"" throughout the years would be absolutely hilarious in my opinion. 

Hope everyone reading this has a great rest of their day/night :).  

Semi related, if anyone else is fiending for some more Cody Zeller highlights, this is probably my favorite highlight mix of his [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Io29TVLN8bg&amp;t=186s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Io29TVLN8bg&amp;t=186s) .

2024-07-02,1719964344,"[Scotto] The Knicks have also made inquiries on the trade market, showing interest in Jazz center Walker Kessler, league sources told HoopsHype, along with Hornets center Nick Richards, as previously reported by HoopsHype.",,CharlotteHornets,19,https://www.reddit.com/r/CharlotteHornets/comments/1du0ej9/scotto_the_knicks_have_also_made_inquiries_on_the/
2024-06-28,1719555901,Are the Hornets tanking in 2024?,"A lot of hornet content creators and fans  have said that they think the organization is tanking in 2024 because of the Tidjane selection. Heres 7 reasons why I dont think the hornets are and shouldnt tank.

1. Our core players need to have experience with the playoffs. 

2. The hornets have a good chance at making the playoffs. The east is very weak, and theres 5 teams alone Im confident the hornets are better than ( wizards, pistons, bulls, raptors, nets ). This alone would put us at a 10th seed

3. Flagg is a great prospect, but we arent guaranteed to get the #1 pick even if we do tank ( shown this year when we dropped to 6 )

4. Before the injuries, the hornets should last year at the deadline showed they were capable of winning games with miller and miles when they surrounded them with nba caliber players. They went on a 5 game win streak and were competitive with some playoff teams, but loss due to a lack of offensive fire power. Weve seen our core show the ability to win games, the main factor is health.

5. The Tidjane pick doesnt mean miles is gone. Tidjane will likely take 1-2 years before he plays impactful minutes here. The plan in the future most likely is to have slide miles down to the 3 and move Tidjane to the 4 when hes ready. 

6. Miles is likely coming back. Reports are saying that miles and the honest have mutual interest on getting a deal done. Miles doesnt seem to have too many suitors. The biggest threat was Detriot and its rumored they want to take on salaries rather than big name free agents.

7. Potential year 2 leap from Brandon miller. Mjller most of the season was without Lamelo, and was the first option most of the season. Despite this he averaged 17 points per game with very little help pre deadline. He showed he can get to his spots and score efficiently even against top defenses as a rookie. With lamelo creating more open shots for him, a potential all star leap next season isnt too far fetched

Extra note: I believe mark and lamelo will figure out their injury issues. Mark has said hes feeling better and by the hornets passing on clingan, Im sure they feel good about his health. Charless Lee and his new staff will help as much as they can to help Lamelo with his injury issues.

2024-06-01,1717263826,Reddit Mock Draft - Pick 6 - Charlotte Hornets,"Hey, Hornets fans! I'm conducting a mock draft where each NBA team subreddit makes their picks for their team. The Hornets have the sixth pick, so the Hawks, Wizards, Rockets, Spurs, and now Pistons have already made their selections. They are as follows:

1 - Atlanta Hawks - Alexandre Sarr

2 - Washington Wizards - Zaccharie Risacher

3 - Houston Rockets - Reed Sheppard

4 - San Antonio Spurs - Stephon Castle

5 - Detroit Pistons - Dalton Knecht

6 - Charlotte Hornets - ???

That means that those **guys listed above are off limits**. Because polls aren't allowed on this subreddit, the most upvoted comment by tomorrow morning is the winner. Also **trading the pick is not an option** for this mock.

Some of the top options available for the Hornets are Donovan Clingan, Matas Buzelis, Rob Dillingham, Nikola Topic, Ron Holland, Tidjaune Salaun, and Cody Williams.

Please comment your favorite below and upvote any that you agree with. Thanks!",CharlotteHornets,64,https://www.reddit.com/r/CharlotteHornets/comments/1d5sg8u/reddit_mock_draft_pick_6_charlotte_hornets/

Obviously, the biggest thing in favor of the Celtics is that our future coach, Charles Lee, is a part of the staff and would get a Ring from the endeavor.

Against them, outside of them being an EC rival, is of course Tatum, who I know rubbed some people on here the wrong way via his comments about playing in Charlotte.

So, when the time comes, who will you be casting your lot with?",CharlotteHornets,108,https://www.reddit.com/r/CharlotteHornets/comments/1d8vqiw/so_hornets_fans_are_you_rooting_for_the_celtics/

The purpose of this mega thread is for centralized chatter and discussion of any fan-proposed trades prior to the 2024 NBA trade deadline, rather than countless self posts or trade machine links which really don't need their own threads.

Tweets/articles from media or other reputable sources regarding rumors and trades can still be posted as their own threads, this is primarily for trade chatter/discussion and trade ideas by fans &amp; related comments. If you have a high quality text submission, by all means, go for it.

This thread will remain stickied and enforced until the trade deadline passes.

**Thank you for your cooperation. Bonk on. =**

2024-01-10,1704911216,The first call ownership needs to make,"We all know Mitch &amp; Cliff's days are numbered, but this post isn't about GM and HC candidates.

There's a man out there who could possibly do just as much for the future of this team as whoever we hire at GM/HC. 

His name? [Keke Lyles.](https://www.linkedin.com/in/keke-lyles-06807aa6/details/experience/)

Who is he? He's the guy who fixed Steph Curry's ankles as Director of Performance for the Warriors back in the mid-2010s. Here's an [ESPN article](https://www.espn.com/nba/story/_/id/14750602/how-golden-state-warriors-stephen-curry-got-best-worst-ankles-sports) that shed some incredible light on how Curry went from almost out of the league to, well, Curry by overhauling his off-court approach to training. 

I bet rn you're thinking ""Ok, cool, but why would come here?"" That's where things get interesting...After his stint with the Warriors, Lyles was hired as the Exec. Dir. of Player Performance for the Hawks, where he worked from 2015-18.

Who was a minority owner of the Hawks that entire time? Our current part-owner and acting team Governor, [Rick Schnall](https://www.nba.com/hornets/front-office).

The guy currently in charge of stewarding this team has a prior working relationship with one of the most in-demand sports medical science savants in the country, and we better take advantage of that. If Schnall can't get Lyles, he needs to toss him a consulting fee to put together a shortlist of player performance candidates for us to go after. If ownership is actually serious about building a winner, he's their first call. Hopefully, they've already called him. 

As currently constructed, this franchise will largely go as far as Melo's ankles can take us. We need to be doing everything we can as an organization to put these problems (and our history of chronic injuries up and down the roster) behind us. And it's gonna take more than just ""make Melo wear braces"" to get there.",CharlotteHornets,7,https://www.reddit.com/r/CharlotteHornets/comments/193f7m5/the_first_call_ownership_needs_to_make/

Source: https://sports.yahoo.com/rockets-priorities-shifting-as-nba-trade-deadline-nears-180638480.html

&gt; Phoenix continues to be mentioned as the leading suitor for Charlotte forward Miles Bridges, league sources told Yahoo Sports. The Suns see Bridges, a Michigan State product, as a strong fit with their big three of Kevin Durant, Devin Booker and Bradley Beal. However, the Suns only have second-round draft capital to play with. And while Phoenix has indicated a willingness to add Josh Okogie into a package of Nassir Little and two second-round picks for Bridges, sources said, Charlotte remains hopeful it can generate a first-round pick in return for Bridges.

&gt; If not, Charlotte now has the upcoming cap space to re-sign Bridges, and getting the swingman on a multi-year deal would surely increase his trade value next season. The fact Bridges is playing this 2023-24 campaign on a one-year qualifying offer not only affords Bridges veto power in any trade, but dealing him elsewhere would squander Bridges Bird rights, preventing any team that acquired him before Thursday to re-sign him this summer if it is going to be over the salary cap June 30. So there may even be stronger options for Charlotte to move Bridges as a sign-and-trade candidate this summer as well.",CharlotteHornets,56,https://www.reddit.com/r/CharlotteHornets/comments/1ajnz3l/fischer_while_phoenix_has_indicated_a_willingness/

2024-02-26,1708973034,How likely do you think it is that Clifford returns as our coach again next year?,"Pre trade deadline every single person that watches this sport would have said Clifford was a dead man walking. But after the deadline we have won 5 of 6, have the best defensive efficiency of any team in the NBA, the second best record of any team in basketball and are top 7 in overall efficiency since the deadline. The players all seem to rave about Clifford too. 

So my question is this. How likely do you think it is that he's back next year? There's no way we'll continue to have THIS level of results for the rest of the season but I feel like if we're above .500 and a top 10 team defensively post all-star break he's coming back next year.

Despite this Mark Williams has managed to have a positive total +/- of +2, although since its still so small it will likely shift between positive and negative from game to game unless the Hornets win some of their upcoming games. Mark Williams having the highest +/- out of everyone on the Hornets does not include Amari Bailey and Leaky Black for obvious reasons.

2023-11-18,1700323160,Amari Bailey with 26 points and Leaky Black with near triple-double in G-League debut win,"In their G-League debuts both Amari and Leaky played really well and were big parts in helping the Greensboro Swarm defeat the Raptors 905.

Amari Bailey in 29 minutes: 26/6/3/1/1 and +22 +/-. He shot 10-20 from the field, 0-2 from 3 and 4-4 on free throws. It should be noted that in situations where players are given two free throws in the NBA, players are instead given one free throw for two points in the G-League.

Leaky Black in 28 minutes: 12/11/8/2/0 without a single turnover and +24 +/-. He shot 4-6 from the field, did not attempt any 3s and hit both of his free throws. His defense was excellent and he played a big part in Greensboro holding 905 to just 82 points.

Amari Bailey led the team (and the game) in scoring meanwhile Leaky Black led the team in rebounds, assists and steals. It should be noted that Greensboro have lost all of their 3 prior games this season and that this is their first game scoring more than 100 points.

I have always been on high Amari Bailey and Leaky Black is already looking like a better defender than most players on the Hornets. Since neither of them will probably be getting any real meaningful minutes in the NBA this season its nice seeing them have such an excellent start to their G-League season.",CharlotteHornets,14,https://www.reddit.com/r/CharlotteHornets/comments/17y9hjz/amari_bailey_with_26_points_and_leaky_black_with/

After being bored of hearing the same names I decided to look in to some others players that the hornets could take with this pick or trade down in the draft to select. One prospect that stood out to me was Dalton Knecht. I feel that if we are trying to improve next year or make the play ins he could be a valuable asset immediately that could help space the floor and create in small sample sizes of the catch.

I personally dont feel that any teams would look to take him that early on in the draft and we could trade down slightly to get more assets back.

A scenario I could see happening would be the spurs trading up from 8th to 6th to select one of the wings like Holland or Buzelis or taking a guard like Dillingham, Topic or Castle if they dont take one with the 4th pick. Idk the exact details of the trade but that is just an example.

Just was curious about you guys thoughts

2023-11-04,1699060474,Fun little stat to show how impactful Mark Williams has been on defense this year despite the slow start.,"Basically what the title says. So, when Mark Williams is on the court the team has a defensive rating of 110.8 which would be good enough for the 16th best defense in the league. When Mark Williams is not on the court the team has a defensive rating of 121.8 which is good enough for the worst defensive rating in NBA history. That means that Mark improves Charlottes team defensive rating by 11.0 points or +11. Here are the stats of how much other notable players across the league this year improve their team defensive rating for reference.

(Not the actual league ranking since I couldnt find any, just some notable players)

Victor Wembanyama: +27.1 (wow)

Kawhi Leonard: +21.7

Paul George: +15.2

LeBron James: +14.3 (actually suprised)

**Mark Williams: +11.0**

Brandon Miller: +8.0 (=)

Anthony Davis: +5.9

Anthony Edwards: +1.2

Clint Capela: -1.8

Ben Simmons: -1.9

Jaren Jackson Jr.: -2.7

Trae Young: -3.7

Chet Holmgren: -3.7

Damian Lillard: -11.2

LaMelo Ball: -11.9 (yikes)

Kyle Kuzma: -12.3

Jordan Poole: -14.2

PJ Washington: -20.6 (bigger yikes)

I ended last season not going to the final 10 or so games because the team, in large part, was unrecognizable.

Now, this season, were back to our injured ways. Its disappointing and, from a paying fans positions, a letdown.

Im no basketball pro, but it very much seems like we have this cycle of using and abusing our guys. They either arent tough enough or conditioned enough. Or maybe both. And its probably also due to them trying to constantly overcompensate for a lack of talent.

Either way, you have a problem. 

Seats have been noticeably emptier this season. That eventually will be something you care about.

I have great seats. Four of them. And Id love to stop thinking about ditching them.

2024-07-20,1721518645,Am i crazy for thinking we're good?,"Hear me out:

Tre Mann: has been a nice player for has and had showed glimpses of stardom in Okc too (i'm not saying he'll turn out into an all-star but he is a great player)

Nick Smith Jr. : Getting better by the day, he has a great potential, a nice three point shot and between last season and this one his transition from a g leaguer who sometimes gets a shot in the first team to a back up guard will be complete

Lamelo Ball: Not much to say, all-Nba player but glass ankles and no will to use ankle braces

Vasilije Micic: An absolute phenomenal player if you ask me, doesn't get talked about about because he comes from the Euro league but he showed some incredible stuff, i'd argue he is our second best player at the point

Reggie Jackson: A nice veteran (not TOO old though) so a reliable player

KJ Simpson: A late second round pick so not many expectations but the fact that the lights aren't pointed at him and that he (at least it seems like it) is a dedicated player who wants to put the work in and is grateful to play for us even though we are a small franchise could turn out into something nice.

Seth Curry: A great shooter from behind the arc, fits into the culture and you can see he likes it here 

Cody Martin: Has the potential to be as good as his brother but hasn't showed much 

Brandon Miller: face of the franchise if you ask me. All-nba potential in a five year period of time and all-star potential in even less, great work ethic as we saw last season when he was one of the few trying during tough games

Josh Green: Not much of a fan but he is a nice shooter (48/38/68 last season) and also has some size to him

Miles Bridges: I'll start by saying i don't think he should be allowed to play professional basketball, however he is on our roster and he is a hell of a player, not a sharpshooter but sharp in everything else you can do on a basketball court

JT Thor: he will probably be cut and even though he has potential he is not good enough for the Nba at the moment (wish i could be proved wrong) 

Tidjane Salaun: Glimpses of Giannis but as many already said, the rawest prospect of the draft class so i don't expect him to win ROY or to be the best forward in the league even in the next couple of years, i predict him to go 7/2/6 with almost a block 

Nick Richards: When he is in the zone he is a guarantee under the rim, a great player if you ask me and should he kept at all costs

Grant Williams: Played good for us and seems to love the team and the culture, however everytime he steps on the court i expect a bad game more than i expect a good one but i hope he will keep playing well

Taj Gibson: doesn't have much to give on the court but he is a great locker room guy (our Udonis Haslem maybe) 

Mark Williams: i might be an idiot but i think an healthy Mark Williams is one of the best centers in the league, when he played last season he led the league in fg% and dropped 20+ boards on the Hawks on the first game, i see him competing for Dpoy in 5 years if he stays healthy.

2024-07-12,1720813094,Appraising the Hornets stash of future draft picks ,"The Hornets now have the best draft pick stash theyve had in recent times. Its not on OKCs level, but much better than theyve had in forever. What might the value of these picks be? Lets take a look:

A few important notes: 
* The Hornets owe a lottery-protected 2025 first round pick to San Antonio. If they miss the playoffs this year, they will have control of all their future first round picks. 
* If the above scenario happens, the Hornets will instead owe 2026 and 2027 second round picks. 
* The only other pick obligation is a 2025 second round pick to Indiana, protected 31-55. Unless they are a top 5 team this year, they will keep the pick. 

*The most likely scenario is the Hornets will control all future first round picks and will only owe two seconds in 2026 and 2027.*

Incoming picks (by year):

**2025:**

*New Orleans 2nd round pick:* New Orleans finished as the 8-10th best team in the league (3-way tie) this season. With the addition of Murray and the moves around the league, I think a finish just a few spots higher or lower is likely. I believe this pick will be between about 45 and 55. 

**2027:**

*Dallas 1st round pick:* This pick is top-2 protected. Luka has a player option leading into this season and Kyrie will turn 35 years old that March. If Luka walks, this pick could be very high. I believe it will be most likely be between 20-30, but has potential to be top 10. 

*Miamis 1st round pick:* This is lottery-protected and could become unprotected in 2028 if Miami misses the playoffs in 2025 (due to another trade and the Stepien Rule) or 2027.  I believe it will most likely be between 15-22, but it could fall nearly anywhere in the 2028 draft, depending on if Miami is able to retool around Bam/Herro. 

*Either Portland/New Orleans 2nd round pick:* Charlotte will get the most favorable pick. Given recent league history and how good the west is, I think theres a good chance this pick falls between 31-40.

**2028:**

*Los Angeles Clippers 2nd round pick:* This is a pick swap. If LAC is worse than the Hornets, this pick will convey. This is an aging roster without many assets to improve. I think there is a lot of potential, and consider a range of 38 to 45 or so to be likely. 

**2029 and 2030:**

*Denvers 2nd round picks (both years):* Jokic will be in his mid-30s. Denver has not looked willing to spend on a deep roster. After Murray and MPJ, things looks grim, and its rare for championship cores to stay intact for nearly a decade. Its far out and these picks could fall anywhere 31-60, but I think there is serious potential for picks in the 30s or 40s.

2024-01-27,1706355334,"Miles Bridges subject of multiple NBA trade rumors, but: I want to stay with the Hornets","Good read. Watching the team the last couple of games I felt like maybe Miles was being impacted by the trade rumors and looking forward to moving on (he looked out of it). If that was the case - I thought they should go ahead and move him because that energy rubs off on others. It was good to read this and see that he wants to be here (which is not a small thing) and that they (as expected) are just rebounding from the Terry trade. 

If he can rock steady for the rest of the season, I want to bring him back (though I understand those who want him gone).  I am not on the ""blow everything up"" train, as I believe that we are building and keeping your 25 and under, pre-prime quality assets is the way to go (definitely not losing them for a Bojangles 2 piece to the Suns, Sixers or the like).  Ball / Miller / Bridges / Washington / Williams / Richards / Smith Jr. are quality building blocks (yes. all 7 of them - they just need to be casted correctly and time to develop). Getting rid of Miles for the sake of ""re-building"" which includes getting top picks that you **hope** can turn into Miles or better in a few years is a waste of time.  Move on with those 7, hit on another draft, and use the 50 million freed up from Hayward/Rozier coming off the books to bring in high quality starters/role players (ex. the Rockets). Just my 2.

- Wizards
- Bulls (given the DeMar trade really, that set them back to a  far-below-.500 team)
- Hawks (this can go both ways. But without Murray, Im for sure starting to swing this in favor of the hornets. I always thought our rosters at full health were comparable. But with A1 coaching from our guy Lee, I cant unsee us as the better team&right now)

Which, by my math would have us around a 9 seed. Im feeling my usual Hornets delusion meet a new sense of optimism this org suddenly is inspiring, so, opening the floor to be debated with about which of these teams are better than us, and why? 

I understand we shouldnt want to miss the lottery picks in this draft, but its also still possible to land in the lottery from the play in, especially given how much better the west is than the east. I see only 2-4 teams in the west finishing in the lottery again - mainly the Spurs and Blazers. Probably the Jazz.

At any rate, I like hearing yalls thoughts, so weigh in. Potentially lets share this delusion, since its more likely our misery will continue to be shared as company come March, like usual.

From making the decision to be sellers at the deadline, getting picks AND players, no more nepotism in the FO, hiring the top assistant from the champs, renovation Spectrum Center, new medical staff..it's hard to argue with what they've done so far. 

What am I missing? Or do you disagree with something they have done? What is next?

I think they will trade or let Miles go. If he walks, use cap space for bad contracts and picks.  They will have core 4 of Miller, Williams, Lamelo, and #6 pick plus bench of Richards, Grant, Mann, Micic, Martin, that's a 9 man rotation before NSJ, Poku, McCowens, and TOs for Curry and Thor.

I saw a lot of people saying it was gonna take some time for him to shake off the rust but he came swinging (no pun intended) right out of the gate. He has also been one of the best defenders on the team this season. The thing that has impressed me the most is that he hasnt any bad games, he has been doing a lot of stuff outside of scoring that we didnt see a lot of in previous years. The only bad scoring game he has had was against the Celtics when he scored 14 shooting 3-13 from the field but he made up for it with 15 rebounds, 5 assists and some super important plays in the clutch. He also hit all 6 of his free throws. He played really well toinght leading the Hornets in scoring with 23 points on 9-17 FG and managing to 10 rebounds.

Take away who those picks became, like from my perspective that doesnt even need to be relevant to question this decision. We traded the 13th overall pick for a future pick we 100% knew (barring some injury catastrophe for Denver) was going to be a much worse pick in the future.

2024-02-16,1708082994,An in-depth analysis of Brandon Miller's game [OC],"*\[Hi folks, this was originally meant for a more general NBA audience, so please excuse any ""no duh"" things in here for Hornets fans. Thanks!\]*

Brandon Miller entered the league with more uncertainty swirling around him than any #2 pick in recent memory. Character concerns, a poor March Madness showing (partially due to an injury), and questions about whether Miller was truly worthy of being the second pick ahead of heavily hyped prospects like Scoot Henderson and the Thompson twins contributed to perhaps the least-celebrated selection in years.

Not all of those questions can be answered in a couple of months, of course. But on the court, Miller is starting to look like a star two-way wing, the most coveted archetype in the NBA. I doubt Hornets fans would trade Miller for any of the players selected behind him.

The Hornets outrageous rash of injuries (and Miles Bridges suspension for heinous domestic violence) meant that they have been one of the most incomplete teams in the league even before several of their best players were traded. Nobody on the team has missed fewer than six games, and many of the biggest names, including LaMelo Ball, promising second-year center Mark Williams, and since-traded $30 million man Gordon Hayward, have missed dozens. This team has given real minutes to Yoda-sized and Yoda-aged Ish Smith, who has seemingly been a borderline NBA player for his entire career.

*\[I've collected a bunch of illustrative video clips for this post. You* [*can view those video clips in-context here*](https://www.basketballpoetry.com/p/brandon-miller-will-be-a-winner-dont)*, and I think they add a lot to the post.\]*

Add it all up, and Miller is playing with a new combination of often replacement-level teammates practically every night  and it shows in the standings, where the Hornets are one of the worst teams in the league.

There is a silver lining, though. Miller has been thrust into a more significant role than even he likely imagined. Without much guard depth before recent trade-deadline acquisitions, the Hornets have been running big chunks of their pick-and-roll offense through Miller. For the season, Miller is averaging nearly 17 points, four rebounds, and two assists while shooting 44% from the field and 39% from deep on high volume. In eight February games, Miller is up to 24 points and 43% three-point shooting on nearly eight long-balls per game.

As a scorer, hes become more adept throughout the season at leveraging the pick *and* the roll to get a bit closer to the basket before rising up for that silky midrange: \[[video here](https://www.basketballpoetry.com/p/brandon-miller-will-be-a-winner-dont)\]

The three-point shot is not as aesthetically pleasing to my eyes (his shooting hand flies forward like a leashed puppy darting after a squirrel), but its just as effective. 39% on six triples per game is impressive on its face, but consider this: [only Miller and Keegan Murray (last year) have ever hit those benchmarks as a rookie](https://stathead.com/basketball/player-season-finder.cgi?request=1&amp;year_min=1968&amp;display_type=per_g&amp;ccomp%5B1%5D=gt&amp;cval%5B1%5D=5.9&amp;cstat%5B1%5D=fg3a_per_g&amp;ccomp%5B2%5D=gt&amp;cval%5B2%5D=.385&amp;cstat%5B2%5D=fg3_pct&amp;season_end=1). In other words, this season is one of the greatest combinations of accuracy and volume weve ever seen in someones first year.

Miller was entirely a catch-and-shoot player to start his career, but as Charlotte ballhandlers started dropping like flies, he added an off-the-dribble triple (he now [shoots two per game](https://www.nba.com/stats/player/1641706/shots-dash?LastNGames=10), a sign of his burgeoning confidence). This is a club that stars must have in their golf bag to open up the rest of their game: \[[video here](https://www.basketballpoetry.com/p/brandon-miller-will-be-a-winner-dont)\]

(Tangent: I love that Buzz City court. Charlottes overall art is some of the leagues best.)

Speaking of the rest of his game, Millers passing is tantalizing but limited. At this point in his career, hes a play finisher, not a playmaker, and thats fine. There are times when he throws pinpoint alley-oops that even starting point guards might struggle with&

\[[alley-oop pass video here](https://www.basketballpoetry.com/p/brandon-miller-will-be-a-winner-dont)\]

&and there are times when he takes yet another contested pull-up midranger and looks off or misses wide-open teammates. He has to get better at making the easy kick-out passes when hes swarmed in the painted area instead of barfing up a deeply difficult shot, particularly early in the shot clock: \[[video here](https://www.basketballpoetry.com/p/brandon-miller-will-be-a-winner-dont)\]

Decision-making issues are the natural byproduct of a highly-touted rookie scorer growing through pains on an awful team. His basic and advanced passing numbers are similar to Kevin Durants rookie season, and Durant has become a more than acceptable passer. But Miller must  and should  improve in subsequent seasons. Hes at least shown the ability to make high-level passes occasionally; he needs to see the opportunities more often. That will come as the game slows down for him.

Millers handle, similarly, can be tightened up (although hes already become noticeably more comfortable with changing tempos as the season has gone on). He can use it to get past the first line of defense, but he hasnt entirely developed the ability to get all the way to the rim yet consistently. This was something that dogged him in college, too.

He does look comfortable attacking closeouts, and he will occasionally uncork a dunk so nasty that you wonder why he cant do it more often. Walker Kessler had to be reconstituted from his component particles after challenging Miller here: \[[video here](https://www.basketballpoetry.com/p/brandon-miller-will-be-a-winner-dont)\]

Along those lines, the highest-end Miller outcomes profile to be someone like Paul George, Jayson Tatum, or Kevin Durant (in tendencies, if not talent). But as rookies, all three of those players took more than a quarter of their shots at the hoop. Only [20% of Millers field goal attempts](https://cleaningtheglass.com/stats/player/5214#tab-shooting_frequency) have been at the rack, and he is more comfortable pulling up for the middie. That trend has held steady throughout the year. Unless he becomes a truly historic jump-shooter (possible, but mathematically unlikely), that will have to change if he ever wants to approach those superstars.

He is already trending the right way on the other end. Miller is a high-effort, high-IQ defensive player. The bold outlines of an excellent stopper are there; he just has to color them in.

Millers 72 wingspan is apparent whenever he scuttles alongside ballhandlers, hands always held high. His rotations are better than most rookies and many vets, and hes usually aggressive but balanced on his closeouts. Hes at his best in isolation, using his length to dictate the rules of engagement: \[[video here](https://www.basketballpoetry.com/p/brandon-miller-will-be-a-winner-dont)\]

Are there mistakes? Of course; no rookie can avoid the inevitable ball-watching moments. But hes learning quickly despite working in a poor defensive environment.

Miller isnt afraid to get grimy, either. Hes [top-15 in total charges taken ](https://www.nba.com/stats/players/hustle?PerMode=Totals)leaguewide and behind only LaMelo Ball in deflections per game for the Hornets (although Id like to see that number tick higher). Hes a good communicator, pointing out matchups in transition and switching as effectively as any Hornet when required to (a low bar, to be sure).

Miller has solid verticality in the air, but he gets caught with his hand in the cookie jar a bit too often when trying to stymie drivers. For a rookie, however, his foul rate is acceptable. Experience will teach him when he can and cant get away with little pokes at the ball.

Perhaps surprisingly, given his height, [coach Steve Clifford has had Miller primarily defending smaller ballhandlers or shooters](https://www.nba.com/stats/player/1641706/head-to-head), barring the occasional OG Anunoby or Scottie Barnes. Charlotte doesnt run nearly as much zone as they once did, but when they do, Miller often spearheads the defense at the point of attack. This is partially due to Charlottes poor guard depth, although having to defend zippy jitterbugs should accelerate Millers defensive development, and partially due to a lack of strength. Adding muscle will come with time.

Miller is more of a positionally sound defender than a playmaker at this point, although you wouldnt know it from his last few games. He averaged a steal and a block per game in college, and Id expect him to eventually be a two-stock guy in the NBA. He flashes frenetic spurts of promising activity, particularly in his transition defense: \[[sick chase-down block video here](https://www.basketballpoetry.com/p/brandon-miller-will-be-a-winner-dont)\]

One other thing that cant be adequately quantified: Miller plays with a welcome passion. Most rookies are concerned about finding their place in a teams pecking order, trying to meet expectations, and avoiding the coachs doghouse. Miller wants to win, and he isnt shy about it. Check him [screaming at teammates to get the f\*\*\* back!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SLGya3IgnTs) when he was displeased with their transition defense. Hes also been involved in several minor dust-ups with opponents, the kind where he refuses to be dogged out.

Rookies are rarely that assertive, but as I said at the start, Miller is a rare breed. Weve almost never seen rookies come in and be this productive as three-point shooters, and hes ahead of what I expected as a ballhandler and defender. Miller is already a strong 3-and-D-and-a-little-more player with a winning attitude, and hes leveling up rapidly.

He has things to improve on before he can reach his final form, of course. As Pokémon taught me, nobody evolves without a little grinding. But the Miller conversation has transcended the questions that haunted him months ago; instead, were asking how good he can ultimately become. Without a doubt, that shift is the most important Charlotte Hornets victory this season.",CharlotteHornets,20,https://www.reddit.com/r/CharlotteHornets/comments/1as6e1z/an_indepth_analysis_of_brandon_millers_game_oc/

2024-02-28,1709141853,Dell and Eric are a great duo,"Bucks fan coming in peace, I love listening to the opponent's broadcast (sans Warriors and Nuggets) and I absolutely loved the duo of Dell and Eric. Eric in particular has the ability to simultaneously be a undeniable Hornets fan without being a total homer. The duo also clearly love good basketball and are quick to acknowledge any player on the court. 

I don't know if it's the production team or Eric but I was impressed at how prepared and knowledgeable he was. From dropping knowledge about Brandon Jenning's playing random courts to the insane fact that the only time Damian Lillard led the league in an NBA statistic was his rookie year when he led the league in minutes played. 

Seriously looking forward to the next broadcast and shame Lamelo is injured or I'd tune into a Hornets game from time to time. Big up to you real fans for riding with the team during their current struggles.",CharlotteHornets,19,https://www.reddit.com/r/CharlotteHornets/comments/1b2c11j/dell_and_eric_are_a_great_duo/

2024-02-12,1707767629,An ode to Mitch,"I know some in this sub couldn't wait to take Mitch to the airport personally. I am old enough to remember the disasters that were the Rod Higgins/Rich Cho years. 

You cannot judge Kupchak's tenure in CHA without the massive caveat we will never fully know what was an MJ decision vs a Mitch one.

Mitch did several things wrong. But mostly right, I think. It didn't lead to success record wise. But overall, he set the team up for long term success. 

2021 draft aside, his first and second round picks are widely successful. Consider that historically 50% of lottery picks are out of the league within 4 years. And Mitch still found value in late lottery picks.

Miles in 2018-12th
PJ in 2019-12th 
Lamelo fell in 2020. 
The thing about 2021 that never gets talked about is the maturity level of Bouknight and Kai Jones. Are they ""misses,"" yes. But no one can deny their talent level. Perhaps some of the blame for their careers is on them as individuals when Bouknight tried to fight his coach mid game, had crime issues, and Kai Jones maybe has some mental health things to work through. Mitch did his job when evaluating their talent I believe.
2022 Mark Williams at 15.
Add into the 2nd round picks of Cody Martin, Jaden McDaniels, Thor, and Devonte Graham. He has done a nice job.

The 3 biggest things he will be remembered for me are in order..

1. Firing Borrego, getting screwed by Atkinson, being forced to rehire Clifford. This has MJ written all over it. MJ was probably embarrassed by play in disasters. Reports were that Atkinson assistants were not getting paid a proper rate so he withdrew. MJ had a cheap reputation and rehiring a guy you fired says just that. 
2. The decision Mitch never gets credit for is making the controversial decision to trade Kemba for Rozier. This fan base rioted (much like #3), yet ultimately Mitch was correct in that decision. He knew Kembas best days were over. 
3. Drafting Miller over Scoot. I think Scoot will still be good. I was on the Scoot train, but if this is Miller's floor, Mitch once again proved me and 90% of the media and draft Twitter wrong.

It's impossible for him to be judged fairly due to owner interference. 

I for one appreciate his time here. And I think and am hopeful in the next 5 years we will look back and say--damn maybe Mitch did a lot better than we think now that this thing seem to be headed in the right direction. Redemption will come later on. They will build success on the seed he planted.",CharlotteHornets,70,https://www.reddit.com/r/CharlotteHornets/comments/1ap95qm/an_ode_to_mitch/

2024-04-03,1712144624,Charlotte Hornets Draft Analysis,"Im going to start this by discussing the pros and cons of drafting each type of position for the Hornets, and then a brief overview of specific players. After that I will include my favorites for Charlotte. This analysis is assuming that the Hornets have a top 5 pick this year. Keep in mind that I am by no means a draft expert and this is all from a laymans perspective. Most of my info is coming from other peoples scouting reports, big boards, and highlights.

**SHOULD THE HORNETS DRAFT A GUARD?**

- The Hornets have a serious lack of depth at the guard spots, and with serious injury concerns for LaMelo, Charlotte needs someone who can play at a high level with Melo, or in replacement of an unhealthy Ball.

- However, drafting a guard this high up in the draft can be criticized as Charlotte needs another wing player. With Miller be able to play at the 2 or 3, and with Terry and PJ gone, that leaves an open spot at those two positions. Miller is great at the 2 and having another guard leaves Miles to play the PF, which he isnt as good at as he is playing SF. The Hornets drafting a guard this high might be a waste as that player could potentially struggle to find starter minutes.

**SHOULD THE HORNETS DRAFT A WING?**

- Miles is better suited at the 3 and Miller doesnt play PF. The Hornets have a glaring hole at the 4. 

- Depending on size and defensive ability, Miller and Miles could still very well make up a better wing duo, and a guard would still be needed.

**SHOULD THE HORNETS DRAFT A CENTER?**

- Health concerns are a big worry for Mark Williams future, and having another big could ease that pain a bit, with them either replacing Nick as backup, or playing behind him when Mark is hurt. Many Centers can also be put at the 4 spot, creating a possible Gobert-KAT like duo for Charlotte.

- The Hornets already have 2 competent 5s, and drafting another one, especially this high can certainly be seen as a head scratcher.

**POTENTIAL GUARDS**

*Nikola Topi* (Serbian KLS) - Great playmaker and ball handler, with a real knack to get inside the paint. Inconsistent defender with a jumpshot that has upside, but needs work.

*Reed Sheppard* (Kentucky) - Fantastic 3&amp;D player with great playmaking ability as well. Ball handling needs to be mastered also. The biggest concern with Shepard is that he is only 63 and can be overpowered by bigger guys.

*Stephon Castle* (UConn) - Good playmaking ability and finishing touch. Great defender whose shot can become dangerous, but is a cause for concern with how inconsistent it is. Missed one month of the season due to a meniscus injury.

**POTENTIAL WINGS**

*Zaccharie Risacher* (LNB Pro A, France) - 3 point shot has taken a big jump this year and Risacher is a great defender who gets in the right spots consistently. Playmaking is solid, with the biggest concern being his poor finishing at the rim and lackluster shot creating ability.

*Cody Williams* (Colorado) - Solid finisher, playmaker, and a high energy defender. Needs to develop strength, and while theres potential, the 3 and midrange is a definite weak spot.

*Matas Buzelis* (G League Ignite) - Great offball and transition player who has shown to be a really good playmaker. Soft touch at the rim and a shot that shows upside but is a major question for him coming into the draft. Not the best ball handler and defense is a mixed bag.

**POTENTIAL CENTERS**

*Alexandre Sarr* (NBL) - 611 with a 74 wingspan, the French big can play at either the 4 or 5 and is a fantastic shot blocker, athletic finisher, good defender even outside of blocking ability, and a good playmaker and ball handler. Sarr is truly a wing in a centers body. He shoots a good amount of 3s, although he doesnt make very many. Despite shooting a solid amount, the shot and free throw is just not there right now, although his confidence definitely makes him someone teams could hesitate to leave open. Sarr needs to improve as a decision maker and at finishing with the off hand.

*Donovan Clingan* (UConn) - 72 with a 77 wingspan, Clingan is a defensive monster and lob threat. Big improvements in his post game and a solid post passer as well, Clingan is a huge threat at the rim on both sides of the ball. The shot is nonexistent though, and his FT clip is bad enough where he runs the risk of being a hack-a-shaq type big.

**MY TOP PICKS**

1. *Alex Sarr* - Sarr is in my opinion the best player in this draft and one of the few guys who could really become stars. His ability to play the 4 so well makes him a good fit next to Mark Williams, and could create a great big man duo for Charlotte. We need defense and hes got it.

2. *Zaccharie Risacher* - Good fit next to Miller and Miles and a great defender too. The shot just keeps getting better for Risacher and his biggest concerns arent really big issues.

3. *Reed Sheppard* - While I think Topi is the best guard in this class, the Hornets have one of the worst defenses in the entire NBA, and Shepard is a good 3&amp;D guy. Not to mention Kentucky guards are almost always safe picks.

4. *Nikola Topi* - I think Topi has star potential as a modern day Jerry West, but the defense is a big question and hes not as safe as a pick as some other guys.

5. *Cody Williams* - If the Hornets want a safe pick, Williams is a great pick. The shot needs work but shows potential, and the rest of his game is already there. Plus, his name is Cody, and Charlotte loves players named Cody.

Dont bet on it, though, especially with Charlotte still down a future first from the disastrous Kai Jones trade.

As far as other teams trading assets to acquire Hayward or Lowry, their value isnt what it once was. Hayward is marginally more attractive than Lowry, but neither is going to get attention at their salary unless a toxic contract goes back to Charlotte. As a result, those seem headed toward a late-February buyout.

Also, the hot rumor in league circles is that the Hornets new ownership will make a change in the front office after the trade deadline, so thats worth keeping an eye on as well.",CharlotteHornets,88,https://www.reddit.com/r/CharlotteHornets/comments/1akkuvn/the_hot_rumor_in_league_circles_is_that_the/

EuroLeague titles, regular season MVP, and finals MVPS. Have been following him since the move to
the NBA and so far his game has translated to the NBA, the at the rim finishing, high-level passer,
high IQ creative guy with a midrange shot able to shift defenses. The only thing missing is the
step-back 3s and the pull-up 3s which he used regularly with great success at around career 37%
from 3, mind you whilst being the #1 guy on the team shooting highly contested step-backs and
pull-ups. He is far from a bad 3 point shooter All I can say to you is not to lose hope give him until
the end of the season and the offseason to get fully adjusted to the NBA and get his 3 point shot
back, he can easily be a starter level PG on a play off/play in team.",CharlotteHornets,40,https://www.reddit.com/r/CharlotteHornets/comments/1bexpcw/micic/

2024-01-21,1705809933,Rant because this Mark Williams back injury has broken me.,"What's the reason to believe in this franchise? My bonda fides are pretty solid. I'm an old. I've been to a lot games, more at the old building than the new. I've waited in long lines for Kelly Tripucka's autograph. I'll never not be a fan but what's the point? This Mark Williams back injury has broken me. We had the semblance of a foundation on the horizon (Condor, LaMelo, Miller) and once again doom. How is it possible that professional basketball in this city can be so bleak for so long? Can be so inept?

We're probably gonna win the lottery this year, in a draft that seemingly is a C+. We'll have the glitz of the number 1 pick but land a maybe rotation guy.

We take DJ Augistin instead of Brook Lopez. We don't take Donovan Mitchell. We do take Frank Kaminsky. MKG couldn't shoot, even a little bit. Cody Zeller goes 4th in a draft that has Giannis go 15th. Bouknight. Monk plays better elsewhere. Kai Jones. Have we ever had a 2nd Rounder become good? Miami has a new solid player I've never heard of every season. How is this possible? Pascal Siakam is seemingly fine in Indiana but I've been to Indianapolis, it's not a significantly better city than Charlotte. Not that Siakam had any discernable interest in coming here, but I guess the Pacers get a 5th chance to build something better than the Hornets have ever had. Batum. OMG Batum. Then Hayward. OMG. Lance Stephenson. Remember him? How could this franchise have the greatest icon in the game's history as an owner, who's apparently insanely competitive... MJ's ownership.... what was that? It was bizarre. 

Can we at least try to lean into our incredibly unbelievable bad luck? Can we brand ourselves as the lovable losers, like the Cubs used to be? Who are we? Why have the Gods forsaken us?

This is all a psyop. No franchise(s) can be this oddly bad and not even relevant beyond having a cool looking Starter jackets.",CharlotteHornets,53,https://www.reddit.com/r/CharlotteHornets/comments/19bulzy/rant_because_this_mark_williams_back_injury_has/

2024-07-08,1720402165,After Watching Salaun Film I am 100% sold and think he'll be the next Giannis: Here's why,"For years, the Hornets have had a lot of extremely talented players, but they've faced one main problem - they just don't have anyone who matches up with the Freaks of the league that every contender seems to have these days - the Tatums, Lebrons, Kawhi, Giannis, etc. That 6 foot 7 plus guy who can do it all on both ends of the floor plus is a true world class athlete at that size. It's sort of like a mid-major team playing against Duke. Yeah, they'll have a ton of kids who are just as skilled as duke. But they'll all be about two inches shorter, and also they wont have that guy who can throw down poster dunks in transition like a pro baller.

Salaun fills that gap. He has the sauce you just cant teach - a really, really, big dude with really fluid hips that has really good hand eye coordination. His dribbling is awful, but anyone can practice dribbling drills, it's a pretty repetitive activity. What is a lot harder to learn, however, is being able to throw yourself forward and upward, in stride, with body control, catch the ball in midair and yam it. This even applies to normal people. Every group of casual hoopers who's been playing together for a while knows that some guys will never be able to hit a lefty layup even after playing pickup for half a decade, while some guys can hit a through the legs layup even though soccer is their main sport.

Salaun has this coordination talent in spades. I saw some of his two handed alley oops where he caught the ball with it fully above the square on the backboard and his elbows up around there as well. Easy 34 plus inch vert off two which is great for a big guy. He also has some plays where he really hits a one handed scoop layup through traffic off one foot at high speed. Again, those type of complete movements, you either have that ability at a big size or you just dont. Giannis showed the exact same flashes at 18. Yeah he was raw as heck but he was absolutely enormous with that god given ability to track the ball while running at a full sprint. Finally, Salaun is also both a two foot and a one foot jumper at a very high level which is somewhat rare and I take as a sign of natural coordination.

And the kids shot? Pure pure pure. Very high release with a super efficient movement. Again, at age 18, this is already just something you either have or you dont from muscle memory. I also think players that are generally more naturally analytical and approach basketball from a more intellectual mindset rather than just ""yeah I'm nice with it"" are more likely to develop a prettier shot as well, because they've probably actually taken the time to watch tutorials online or listen to their coach rather than just do what works so that's another good sign.

I don't think I'm the world's best GM but I am a big believer in the eye test - and I thought Miller and Melo both passed these on draft day and they turned out great, while I hated Kaminsky from day one just due to how lame he looked on the court and I turned out to be mostly right so far. Salaun has that X-Factor where he just has some crazy highlights. Kid is just built like a big time NBA prospect - giant limbs, big shoulders. Hornets made the exact right pick and this kid's development will blow people's socks off, mark my words. He's actually super tough for an 18 year old and had some really dominating rebounds and dunks on grown men in a very good French league playoff run. He's basically a way way way more fluid MPJ.

Edit - Didn't quite mean that he's gonna end up rated 97 overall in 2k or whatever like Giannis is. But I did mean he has a lot of the same reasons to indicate he has very high potential for a young relatively unknown international player and will end up as a high level starter.

Edit 2: Pulling out the receipts to defend his finishing potential. The entire sequence from 2:20 to 3:00 in this video [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y7s3jIw5FXc&amp;t=250s&amp;ab\_channel=HoopIntellect](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y7s3jIw5FXc&amp;t=250s&amp;ab_channel=HoopIntellect)

shows a range of elite level finishing potential. Especially watch he gets the ball at a full stop on the far end of the floor at 2:48 and has the ball places accurately and under control inches from the basket release by 2:52. There's absolutely no reason to think that blow by won't be effective against NBA defenders at his size. ""He's 7 feet he just has to run and jump lol""

Edit 3 : Watch this video [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0qVRZCsf5ls&amp;ab\_channel=FrankieVision](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0qVRZCsf5ls&amp;ab_channel=FrankieVision) of Giannis at roughly the same age playing against roughly the same competition. Except for maybe that fastball outlet pass to the left corner at the start if you squint he really does look a bit similar to Salaun on a lot of plays in terms of size, build and height, and at 9 points a game averaging the same stats against worse competition.

Edit 4:

1:12 in this clip of Salaun is also nice, bro could get looks at Bama as a TE. His defender, #11, knows where the ball is going the whole play he just gets dusted. Also 1:40, blow by in between two defenders, no look hand swipe on the trailing defender, then switch hand and super high release with 4 defenders miles below him.

2024-07-01,1719876899,Full Josh Green scouting report from a Mavs fan,"**History:** We took him with the 18th pick in 2020 in a very controversial decision headed by Haralabob in our split front office. He was projected as a defensive guard with great athleticism and a very raw offensive game. Most fans thought hometown hero Desmond Bane was an easy choice and that caused a lot of resentment towards Green in his first couple years here. Green started off getting mostly DNPs in his rookie season, then played mostly unimportant minutes and garbage time as a sophomore before breaking into the rotation as a bench player in his third season.

**Strengths:** 100% hustle at all times, fights for every loose ball. Double plus speed makes him good at running in transition and making distant rotations. His passing vision is elite among role players, he will make some passes that very few other players would have seen. Capable 3 point shooter whose shot only recently developed. Athletic inside finisher, can finish at full speed and above the rim. Long arms for his height combined with a good vertical lets him contest shots well when he is in a good position. Still young and has shown slow but constant improvement.

**Weaknesses:** Does not have a good enough handle to be a secondary playmaker, often loses the ball and his elite speed doesn't show when he tries to dribble. Lateral quickness is not bad but it is the weakest part of his athletic profile. Off the dribble shot creation is very limited, needs someone else to set up his shots. Tendency to get lost in rotation on defense. Does not have the strength to consistently guard wings. He is very poor at navigating screens. Often hesitant to shoot the 3 despite shooting a good percentage last season.

**Ceiling:** As a prospect his defense was thought of as solid and his offense was the question. Now has shown he can be a part of a good offense but  has not lived up to expectations on the other end. If he can learn the nuances of defense and become above average guarding 1-3 while continuing to maintain and make slight improvements to his shot, he should be a low end starter or high end bench piece glue guy on a contender.

**Floor:** If he doesn't improve his defense he'll still be close to average there, but his offensive limitations will become more painful. If this is his peak defensively or his offense falls apart without Luka feeding him wide open shots and alley oops, he may never be more than a sparkplug 9th man who is used to give energy to the team in certain matchups.

**Conclusion:** Despite all the Bane handwringing from our fans, we liked having Kangaroo Josh for the most part and no one could ever question his buy-in or effort. He has electric moments and has become a player that could help most teams. I have no doubt y'all will love him.",CharlotteHornets,36,https://www.reddit.com/r/CharlotteHornets/comments/1dt7hvw/full_josh_green_scouting_report_from_a_mavs_fan/

2024-06-21,1718984759,[Fischer] The Charlotte Hornets are open to sign-and-trade options with Miles Bridges in exchange for bad salary and a draft pick. Miles Bridges was almost traded in exchange for Ben Simmons at the deadline. ,"Source: https://sports.yahoo.com/with-bulls-roster-shakeup-underway-is-zach-lavine-the-next-piece-on-the-move-150136313.html

&gt; Charlotte already conducted its business at Februarys trade deadline as a clear rebuilding seller. The Hornets have the impending free agency of forward Miles Bridges to sort through now. And while Bridges could command upward of $30 million, sources said, the Hornets are also believed to be open to parting with Bridges by way of sign-and-trade, should a productive opportunity present itself. Charlotte, sources said, held conversations with Brooklyn about swapping Bridges in a package that would have brought Ben Simmons to the Hornets in February. Sacramento was another team that inquired about Bridges at the deadline, sources said.",CharlotteHornets,105,https://www.reddit.com/r/CharlotteHornets/comments/1dl74wp/fischer_the_charlotte_hornets_are_open_to/

2024-06-27,1719495272,12 hours to sleep on it 12 reasons to like Salaun. ,"We fans always do this, we convince ourselves to like things our gut initially says is wrong. I did that with Bryce Young because I liked Stroud. So maybe I'm just doing that again with this post...convincing myself to like it...but after a night to sleep on it here's my incompetent rationale...

1. This says a lot about the organization than just the player. I think it's tank city next year. 

2. Youngest guy in the draft, largest upside. They are taking the correct view to truly build through the draft and not MJ this thing for the play in. 

3. It says they are going to be patient and give the FO and coaching staff time to develop players. 

4. Cliffords vote of confidence says a lot. There are the old rumors that he liked Mitchell over Monk or whatever. He's not a good coach but he doesn't bs about young players. He said that about Miller in preseason and was right.

5. This dude is signaling a culture change. The best thing about him is the effort. He and Miller give a shit. Frankly our locker room needs that...looking at you Lamelo. 

6. His physical profile is elite. Great size, frame, going to grow into it more. 

7. Can already dribble, pass, and shoot. Granted he may not be great yet. He's a line driver. But he was 34% on catch and shoot threes. That's what he will do if he plays beyond the G League in year one. And attack close outs. 

8. He's not as much a theoretical player as other guys in his mold in the class. He's a better shooter than Castle, Matas, Holland. He's raw, but the shooting isn't a hail Mary like those guys. 

9. The defense will probably translate soon, because of his elite effort and size. He gets lost on assignments and rotations but I think it's inexperience and not IQ...

10. BC he's a great cutter and help defender. That shows he has IQ, but needs reps. 

11. I love the theoretical length of him and Mark in the front court. Plus a jumbo line up of Lamelo and Miller is just fun. 

12. I think Miles is gone. This dude needs minutes. I think he's a g leaguer this year. But maybe post trade deadline he gets called up and gets some burn. 

He's going to be fun to watch because he's like a kid too big for his body. His effort alone is worth the risk. That's the one thing Peterson said like 11 times. He love the competitiveness.",CharlotteHornets,66,https://www.reddit.com/r/CharlotteHornets/comments/1dprfcm/12_hours_to_sleep_on_it_12_reasons_to_like_salaun/

2024-02-08,1707411298,I come in peace... OKC Thunder Fan Opinion on Tre Mann,"Good day to y'all!

I just wanted to write a brief description of Tre Mann, as a long time Thunder fan, so you will know what you're getting...

\---Superb Locker Room / Hype Man: Tre has always seemed to be a huge positive in the lockerroom and for the team spirit. This is an intangible, of course, but I wanted to say that you're getting a team focused guy first!

\---Offensive Flamethrower Potential: When you watch Tre's game, offensively, he is a score-first type of guy with a absolutely sick dribble and step-back move which arguably creates the most space on a step-back I've seen in the NBA, absolutely no joke. Then the shot goes up, it looks absolutely great... It's the overall efficiency that is his issue. Some games he can easily go for 20pts off the bench in like 10-15 mins, others everything looks good but the mid-range/3pt shots simply don't go in. He has SUCH potential as a mico-wave scorer, and if he can get that channeled you will have a bench scorer gem on your hands.

\---Average Bball IQ/Passing: Tre's IQ is not bad, but it's not great either, which I think is what kept him off the main rotation for us over all, though his efficiency also mattered. He can pass, and will make some great ones, but can also force it which happens too much.

\---Defenisvely Meh: His Defense is absolutely nothing to write home about, though he is very twitchy with fast hands and will gamble, but his lack of elite length prevents him from truly blossoming as an off-ball defender, IMO.

\---Work Ethic: This kid wants it, and will always work very hard. No shame in his work ethic game!

Overall: I think Tre is a fantastic human being and team mate, and could legit develop into a good/very good bench piece for you. I hope he blossoms with the Hornets. We Thunder fans love him, and will miss his manic energy!

Either Cuban was familiar with Muggsy and respected him, or he felt for his situation and did him a solid, or both, but I found that cool

Edit: Here is the source article with Muggsy's statements!

&gt;Ive never met Mr. Mark Cuban, but I tell people that I thank him more than life itself, Bogues, 46, said recently over the phone from his home in Charlotte. I had three years left on my contract when my mom passed away, and I decided it was time to move on [from basketball]. I walked away from the game with three years left on my contract. He (Cuban) could have easily just have bought me out of my contract, but he went on and honored it and paid the three years out and never looked back.

https://www.slamonline.com/archives/muggsy-bogues-thanks-mark-cuban/

*Boguesbereaved over his mothers passingnever suited up in a single game for the Mavericks. Still, Cuban agreed to pay the 5-3 guard the complete balance of his contract. That amount came out to $3, 617, 400 over the course of the three years years remaining.*",CharlotteHornets,8,https://www.reddit.com/r/CharlotteHornets/comments/1e9jjn6/cool_muggsymark_cuban_fact_i_came_across/

2023-11-23,1700782377,Putting LaMelo Balls insane stretch into perspective.,"Its no secret that LaMelo &gt;!LaFrance!&lt; Ball has been playing well recently as Ive started to see lots of posts on this sub about it and people outside of the Hornets fanbase are finally starting to talk about it. But I do feel like you need to compare LaMelo to others and show what kind of company he is in to really understand just how good he is playing. 

These are the statlines he has put up during this 9 game stretch:

30/10/13 on 61.7% TS vs The Mavs

34/4/7 on 67.8% TS vs The Wizards

25/6/6 on 60.2% TS vs The Wizards

32/7/6 on 76.6% TS vs The Knicks

28/6/11 on 48.9% TS vs The Heat

37/5/5 on 55.6% TS vs The Bucks

34/5/9 on 74.3% TS vs The Knicks

36/9/8 on 65.6% TS vs The Celtics

34/8/13 on 52.6% TS vs The Wizards

He is averaging 32.2/6.7/8.7/1.4/0.3 on 49/44/88 splits or 61.5% TS. I will now show you what his stretch looks like when compared with some of the best players in the league.

**LaMelo Ball has the second longest active streak of 25+ point games:** LaMelo has had 9 25+ point games in a row now and the only player in the league with a longer active streak is KD (the best scorer in the world) with 14. He is tied with Embiid (the current NBA scoring leader) for 3rd as he previously had a 9 game streak and is behind Jokic (the best player in the world) as he previously had a 10 game streak.

**LaMelo Ball is averaging the most PPG out of anyone in the league since November 15th:** Since November 15th LaMelo has played 4 games and has averaged 35.3 PPG. That is the most out of anyone in the league.

**LaMelo Ball has had the longest streak of 34+ point games this season, let alone 34+/5+/5+ games:** LaMelo Ball has had a streak of 4 34/5/5 games this season, no other player has even just scored 34 points 4 games in a row this season. Not only that but this is an active streak, he will have the chance to add onto these incredible numbers.

If you want you can be more nitpicky and find more ridiculous sats like these. For example, **LaMelos 9 game streak of 25+/4+/5+ games is the longest out of anyone this season.** Also its active.

Hi, my name is Rod Boone and I'm the Hornets beat reporter with The Charlotte Observer. The season opened last night with a win against Houston and the team has their first home game of the season on Saturday. What better time to take stock in the upcoming season? It's a big season for the Hornets as new owners Gabe Plotkin and Rick Schnall open a revamped Spectrum Center with new coach Charles Lee at the helm. LaMelo Ball is healthy again and the star player joins Brandon Miller and Miles Bridges as the Hornets look to break out of their recent multi-season funk.

Most importantly, what do you want to know about the team and this season?

2024-07-14,1720915488,Charlotte Hornets defeat New York Knicks (94-90) in Tidjane Salaün summer league debut,"The Hornets defeat The Knicks 94-90 in Tidjane Salaüns summer league debut. Tidjane Salaün came off the bench and only played 14 minutes but did a lot in those 14 minutes as he finished with a statline of 8/7/1/0/0 shooting 3-7 from the field, 0-3 from 3 and 2-4 from the FT line. In my opinion production isnt whats most important in summer league, whats most important is how a player looks on the floor and Tidjane Salaün looks good. Im not gonna try to overanalyze 14 minutes of a summer league game but I will say that he looked big, played with a lot of energy and wasnt scared of contact which are all obviously good things. His 3P-shot looks good but it would look even better if it went inside the hoop. He was a streaky shooter in France so hes probably gonna be that here too. Overall it was a good summer league debut. I was scared he was gonna look awkward and be too passive but that wasnt the case at all. Im very excited to see him play on the real team.

The real story of the game was Brandon Miller and Nick Smith Jr. who were both dominating scoring-wise. BMilly finished with 23 points in 32 minutes shooting 7-16 from the field, 5-10 from 3 and 4-4 from the FT line which is a very efficient 64.8% TS. NSJ finished with 24 points in just 28 minutes shooting 9-17 from the field, 4-9 from 3 and 2-2 from the FT line which is an even more efficient 67.1% TS. Its nice seeing NSJ having such a good game after playing like complete dogshit for the past 3 summer league games. I know it was just 3 summer league games but its never good seeing a sophomore struggling so badly in summer league. The only thing I didnt like from any of these 2 was the fact that Miller had 7 turnovers but its like whatever, he made up for it with everything else.

The Hornets are now 4-0 overall in summer league this year and the coaching change is likely the main thing that has helped. Im more excited to see Charles Lee coaching the regular team than anything else really. Also should mention our summer league PG Zavier Simpson has helped, hes playing really well. Hopefully Tidjane Salaün breaks 20 minutes in one of the upcoming games I really wanna see more of him.",CharlotteHornets,23,https://www.reddit.com/r/CharlotteHornets/comments/1e2opl1/charlotte_hornets_defeat_new_york_knicks_9490_in/

He gets to go to Dallas and have a big game in the 2nd round of the playoffs and hes being praised for escaping the Hornets when HE was one of the biggest problems we had this season. 

This franchise has its hands tied more than any other in the league. When youre a perennial loser, it takes a certain kind of player to want to come here that isnt afraid of being mocked. Thats gotta be a good 30-40% of the league at minimum with as immature as so many guys are out there.
