\-Overachieved that one year when kidd got fired (21-16, albeit they won 60 the next year but there was holes on that team the year prior)

\- Has already stepped in rather successfully for multiple coaches... J-Kidd post DUI, J-Kidd post hip injury, J-Kidd post firing, McMillian (twice actually), now AG... also has served as a national team head coach for both the US and Great Britian (according to wikipedia). He is used to this like no other coach in the free agency pool is. Going to start 1-0 here btw.

\-Won three titles with the spurs as an assistant, was on multiple 60 win teams in dallas, has experience with championship caliber teams...usually this is enough to get assistants head coaching looks, apparently not for Big Game Joe.

\-Milwaukee cult hero

\-He has a cool, suave, slicked back hair look which is a relfection of the grace, elegance, and urgency his teams play with

2024-07-08,1720477413,Brandon Ingram to Milwaukee is not even possible,"On an Instagram post with this report I see so many people creating mock trades with Middleton, Bobby, and/or Brook and debating about whether or not Middleton is better or Ingram is better (which personally I think Middleton) but regardless it doesnt matter because this trade isnt even possible.

Like Ive explained in a previous post, due to CBA rules we can only trade 1 player out per trade and that one player has to be making equal to or less than the player(s) we receive. Ingram makes 36 mil in the 2025 season and other than Giannis and Dame we dont have anyone making that much or more, Middleton only makes 31.6 mil and Brook only makes 23 mil so trading for Ingram is not even possible. 

Everyone criticizing the bucks off season needs to learn this new CBA and second apron rules, please stop making mock trades that 1. Are not equally fair for the other team at all, and 2. Are NOT even POSSIBLE.",MkeBucks,82,https://www.reddit.com/r/MkeBucks/comments/1dym1go/brandon_ingram_to_milwaukee_is_not_even_possible/
2024-05-14,1715725673,Middleton isnt going Nowhere deal with it,"           Over the last 5 years people have been begging to trade Middleton even before the injuries. Ive noticed throughout the years that there has been a surge of Bucks fans during the rise of Giannis. Giannis is the GOAT of our franchise but these fans make it obvious they only care about Giannis and not the franchise itself. These people have a some sort of vendetta against Middleton because hes not the same level as some other 2nd options. Love Giannis but we all know who takes us home in the 4th. We are all watching the same games. We all hold our breaths when Giannis shoots free throws or attempts a jumper in the clutch. We all see whos anxious and whos calm. We all saw against the heat who almost threw the ball out of bounds last year because he tried forcing it to Middleton. But hey well brush these moments aside but theres sure as hell a lot of them. 


       Middleton is always injured! We are all watching how he gets injured and you know damn well its not soft injuries any player is getting hurt in these moments. Its not up to him to play back to backs. Where would we be if he didnt lead us against the Hawks in 21 when Giannis was injured? Didnt Middleton only miss a playoff series in 2022? Are we bashing Giannis for getting hurt in 21,23 &amp; 24? Hell no because we all see these are unfortunate injuries but people like to ignore it when it comes to Middleton.


     I could go on and on but understand that at this point in his career he is our 3rd option and we our injury prone 3rd option did to the  pacers while our other two stars were ironically Injured. So before you say trade him look around the league and name me a better 3rd option that can put up what he put up this year.

Pat C. is the new equipment manager and Giannis is on his ass all the time.

Horst becomes the president of operations and Brandon Jennings is the new GM.

Malik Beasley has jumped my all-time favorite bucks list faster than any player ever. He is just so likable, and the fun he seems to have on the court is very cool to see.

He's probably my fourth favorite buck of all time next to Giannis, Khris, and Jennings(Became a Bucks fan in 2012).

Fact is Malik Beasley got paid $43million over past 3 seasons average around $14mill/per. Bucks basically trading Grayson's contract for Beasley's was a STEAL! Beasley has also been a better defender than Grayson and just as good on offense. When playoffs come we'll have Jae Crowder back and Pat Connaughton. BUCKS IN SIX!

So when we're running our offense with you and Giannis, you gotta take those shots, man. We need to see it. We need to see if you miss, how we're gonna rebound, how we're gonna react. We gotta be able to adjust. You feel me? 'Damn, Pat, I never looked at it like that \[Dame\]. But it's true, bro. I'm out here trying to win championships, man. So all those bad shots?

2024-07-20,1721512218,"[Eric Nehm] Chris Livingston: ""I take none of this for granted, bro. Im a hard worker. I come in early, I leave late. I think thats what the coaches can expect of me and what the staff and everybody can expect of me.""","[https://www.nytimes.com/athletic/5646759/2024/07/20/bucks-chris-livingston-summer-league/](https://www.nytimes.com/athletic/5646759/2024/07/20/bucks-chris-livingston-summer-league/)

**Nehm**: Despite being in your second NBA season, youre still only 20 years old. How do you keep in mind that this is still a pretty special place to be even if things havent completely gone your way?

**Livingston**: I take none of this for granted, bro. Im a hard worker. I come in early, I leave late. I think thats what the coaches can expect of me and what the staff and everybody can expect of me.

I think, most importantly, being this young is not being discouraged that Im young. I can still move like a pro, act like a pro, listen to the things that my vets are telling me, the dos and donts. Listening to what the coaches want from me and ask of me. I think just because Im young doesnt mean I cant do the right things, on and off the court.

--- 

**Nehm**: In your rookie season, you didnt receive much playing time. How have you approached summer league this July?

**Livingston**: Its a fight, you know what Im saying? Ive been working. Trying to get in the best shape of my life, thats what Im going to do. Working on my skill development, my shot. My shots always been there, but just speeding my shot up. Being ready to shoot, changing my mindset when it comes to that.

I think this year for me is going to be about sacrifice. Im going to be doing a lot of things Ive never done before in my life, whether thats moving to the four or the five. Im going to be everywhere on the court because I can do a lot of things. Instead of looking at it as a bad thing, I just want to embrace that the coaches believe in me to do certain things on the court that other people cant do. So, just embracing that part of my game, sacrificing a lot for the team, just doing whatever I gotta do to find a spot on the court. Like last year, Im a young guy on a very talented, vet-driven team, so I gotta do whatever it takes at this point.

Obviously Im going to be locked in defensively, bringing the effort, the energy on that side of the ball. But offensively, just finding my niche, finding where the coach needs me to be. Whether thats the corner, the dunker, screen-and-rolling, me at the five, two, three, four, it dont matter to me. Im just going to do whatever Im asked to do.

--- 

**Nehm**: Players like you, Andre Jackson Jr. and MarJon Beauchamp were all here last summer. How have you embraced being a leader this summer?

**Livingston**: Im embracing that a whole lot, even if thats just in training camp. AJ (Johnson) and Tyler (Smith), our new rookies, are coming in asking us questions, so (its about) just getting them right. But also, Im a young guy, so I gotta listen as much as possible. Communication is not just telling people what to do; its listening, too.

Being a good listener, keeping my attitude in check, great body language, just understanding Im trying to do what I gotta to do to win. Being vocal, but also saying the right things with the right tone. Learning how to say what you need, learning your teammates, learning how to talk to them, and just being an encourager more than anything.",MkeBucks,17,https://www.reddit.com/r/MkeBucks/comments/1e86k76/eric_nehm_chris_livingston_i_take_none_of_this/

2023-12-20,1703099227,Flying 4000 miles from Belgium to Milwaukee to watch the Bucks-Clippers on March 4th. Looking for tips to get everything out of the game.,"Hey everyone

&amp;#x200B;

Some of you may recognize my username as I used to be pretty active in the past with my Bucks avenger edits and other stuff, less now that I graduated and work.

Well after staying up till 3-4am 2-3 times a week since 2010 watching the bucks online I'm finally getting the chance to see them live against the clippers on March 4th.

&amp;#x200B;

My question mainly goes out to local Milwaukee people but anyone who has been to games is welcome to give tips. What can I do to fully optimize the 1 bucks game I'll see live in my life probably, I know the doors open an hour beforehand so will be ready to go inside then but what else do you have to do to get everything out of the evening?

For info me and my dad got tickets for section 106JC - row 1, so also get access to the Jockey club, whatever that is.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Thanks in advance everyone,

We beat the number one seed, and are matched with the celtics.

Its a long season, and these standing might change. But if this is our team at its worst, i dont dare dream about what we could be at our best.

2024-01-24,1706107369,"[Justin Wills] According to Malika Andrews on the Woj pod, the Bucks defensive rating over their last 11 games was the worst 11 game stretch in franchise history.","Tweet here: [https://twitter.com/itsjwills/status/1749985033475997985](https://twitter.com/itsjwills/status/1749985033475997985)

This fact is crazy, specially considering they played the 4 win pistons twice and it was a dog fight in both games.

I also think that there's another factor regarding the Bud situation people are forgetting: Even if Bud comes back, he would have to fix a defense with Jrue, but not only Jrue. We lost Jevon and also Wesley Matthews, which were both very capable defenders.

So there's no guarantees Bud would fix this defense, he would have to do it without probably one of the best on-ball defenders in the NBA and two solid good defenders.

And plus if Bud was fired for the lack of playoff adjustments and such, if he comes back you're pretty much gambling that a solid foundation + Dame/Giannis game is enough to beat any team in the association, even if Bud is out-coached, which might be a bit to ask vs teams like the 76ers or the Celtics in the East.",MkeBucks,47,https://www.reddit.com/r/MkeBucks/comments/19eindy/justin_wills_according_to_malika_andrews_on_the/

\-He gave us some memorable games like his 39pts in his debut, 37pts in blowout win against toronto without Giannis and ofcourse his amazing Dame Winner against Kings.

\-Despite playing while dealing with personal stuff (divorce, kids) Dame has given as twelve 30+ points games, twenty-two, 25+ points this season with the bucks

\-Him being the threat he is, has allowed Giannis to have an insanely efficient season (the first 30+ppg with 60%fg in nba history)

\-we were ranked 12th in offensive ratings last year. With dame added on the team, WERE NUMBER 1 ALL-TIME (not just this season but ALL TIME) in offensive ratings (dont search up who were tied with!!)

2024-02-18,1708289648,[Doc Rivers] Taking a job when youre about to go on the toughest road trip of the season is not the smartest decision. I even told them that: Can we wait until All-Star break? It would have been a lot nicer.,"""The end game is what were playing for,"" Rivers added. ""And the organization felt strongly that a change needed to be made defensively and things like that, and thats what were doing. The problem is, while youre doing that, youre in the middle of the season on the toughest trip.""

""Ive been in Milwaukee [for] four days,"" he added. ""Ive had the job for three weeks."" 

The Bucks were 30-13 when they fired Griffin, but they were allowing 116.8 points per 100 possessions, the 10th-worst mark in the league. The Bucks defense has improved under Rivers  theyre holding opponents to 113.6 points per 100 possessions. 

The offense, however, has cratered. 

Giannis Antetokounmpo and Damian Lillard have both put together All-Star campaigns, but the duo has failed to generate the sort of chemistry the Bucks envisioned when they traded for Lillard in the offseason. 

The Bucks have scored just 111.9 points per 100 possessions in the 10 games with Rivers at the helm. That mark was 120.6 under Griffin. 

Rivers was critical of his teams effort after the game, telling reporters, ""We had some guys here, we had some guys in Cabo.""

&gt; LAS VEGAS  After the Milwaukee Bucks were eliminated from the NBA In-Season Tournament by the Indiana Pacers on Thursday, forward Bobby Portis passionately challenged head coach Adrian Griffin and teammates to be better, league sources tell Bleacher Report.

&gt; The Pacers advanced to the IST Finals following a 128-119 victory. The Bucks' offense collapsed in the fourth quarter as the Pacers won the final frame, 37-25.

&gt; Griffin entered the locker room and began harping on the importance of winning the rebounding battle, sources say.

&gt; The Pacers outrebounded the Bucks 51-46.
Portis, who scored four points on just five shots against Indiana in a near-season-low 18 minutes, quickly interjected and stressed how essential it is for Griffin to structure the offense down the stretch of games, sources said.

&gt; As one of the leaders of the team, Portis continued on voicing his concerns. Griffin welcomed the criticism and acknowledged he could do a better job being more aggressive with his play-calling, sources say. The nine-year veteran explained that it's a two-way street: direction is needed and then it's up to the players to execute, sources say.

&gt; One busted offensive possession that proved to be severely costly came with two minutes left in the contest and the Bucks down three.
Myles Turner had just tipped in a goal and Giannis Antetokounmpo proceeded to inbound the ball to Khris Middleton. Damian Lillard came over to retrieve the ball, but Middleton motioned for the guard to run opposite so he could bring the ball up the court.

&gt; Once Middleton made it passed half court, he looked for Lillard who was being hounded by Bruce Brown. Middleton forced the pass and it was picked off.

&gt; Brown's transition layup attempt was halted by Lillard at the rim, but no Bucks players got back and Buddy Hield gathered the offensive rebound and put in the easy two.

&gt; Lillard admitted after the game that he didn't know what they were doing on that possession.

&gt; ""It was an unfortunate play,"" Lillard said. 

&gt; The Bucks, now 15-7 and a game behind the Boston Celtics for the top spot out East, were the favorites to win the IST. Incorporating new pieces into the fold remains a work in progress and Griffin, in his first year as head coach, is still getting to know the strengths of his roster.

One of the most beautiful arenas I have ever seen. Food selection within was amazing. Walking tacos are delicious, and the drinks are poured heavy. Acoustics in there are awesome. Crowd is hyped, DJ is great, and bango is crazy athletic. 2. About the team: Ajax is wild - just everywhere all at once. Sneaky fast and very very VERY high basketball IQ for a rookie. Middleton is cold as ice. Man looked possessed against the warriors on Saturday, just this emotionless beast like Hannibal Lecter. Mid range shot making/taking was just pure technical wizardry. You have to see this in person to really appreciate. Giannis - the usual - makes the supernatural seem ordinary and routine. He's from another planet. His playmaking and passing is the real highlight though. Incredible and extremely unselfish. How he racks up 30 ppg with that degree of ball distribution is a mystery. Beasley - wow. Sniper..... Brook - wow....what doesn't this dude do? Threes, blocks, passing, these ridiculously comical slow motion euro steps that end in uncontested dunks lolol it's just amazing. And always laughing. Dude is living life ....

Finally, downtown Milwaukee is beautiful. Neoclassical architecture, a bit of art deco, the little river running through, and the wonderful friendly people. Bucks, fiserv, Milwaukee, take a bow. What an experience. Loved every minute of it, thank you!!!!",MkeBucks,12,https://www.reddit.com/r/MkeBucks/comments/197s801/first_time_visit_to_mke_saw_both_games_this/

The Senator rarely spoke about the Bucks after he sold the team. Rarer still was any discussion on how he helped the Antetokounmpos get to the U.S. - let alone discussion in public. Until this story, where for the first &amp; only time, he offered comment here. 

He was a big reason [why Milwaukee was the right place &amp; time for Giannis in 2013](https://www.jsonline.com/in-depth/sports/nba/bucks/2023/02/21/milwaukee-was-right-place-for-giannis-antetokounmpo-in-2013-bucks/69854064007/).

The reporting on this took a lonnnggg time, particularly when dealing with State Department officials and former Bucks folks who were still very reticent to talk. But, as always, feel free to hit me up with any questions / comments on the reporting or story itself!

Did I entertain the thought of us trading him after last season? Sure, but only if we didn't have the correct pieces around him to make the best use of him on defense, cause he can look bad if he isn't around the rim, but when he is where he is suppose to be he is incredible. I also think our perimeter defense will hold up much better this year with our new signings, which will keep Brook from having to move around too much and be put in a tough spot.

2024-04-24,1713978741,Trying to rush Giannis back could be one of the worst mistakes in franchise history,"You always have a chance with Giannis, yes, but next year is their best shot at a title. A full offseason program for Dame. A full offseason for Doc to coach up Giannis and Dame on how to play together. A full offseason where Ajax can show Doc that he will be a useful rotation player. A full offseason where Horst can find upgrades over Crowder and Beasley (not hard). And a full offseason where Pat Bev can make an impact on the young guys (bring him back on non-bird rights).

If Giannis tries to come back too soon and tears his achilles, the Bucks may be done as a franchise. The Bucks don't have control of their 2025 pick for next year. By the time Giannis comes back fully healthy, Dame will be on the down swing. Not to mention, I don't think he'll be very happy in Milwaukee anymore and the Bucks will be looking to move his contract to anyone who will take it. Giannis will be in his 30s coming off major injury, and the Bucks have no clear way to improve their roster in the meantime outside of lucking into a 2nd round all-star with the new league rules. If the Bucks aren't winning Giannis is gone, and we'll be watching the Pelicans and TrailBlazers drafting in the top 10 every year for the next decade while the Bucks bring in the 2028 version of Matthew Delledova as the big offseason headliner. Attendance will drop fast, no one is paying over $100 to watch that product. Edens will take his giant net worth profit and sell to highest bidder, and the NBA will be happy to see the Bucks on their way out to St. Louis, Kansas City, or Pittsburgh.

&gt;""\[Rivers\] emphasized like, go more to Dame,"" Antetokounmpo said Monday night. ""When I have the ball, kick the ball ahead to Dame. Set more screens, roll out of the post, dribble handoffs -- he wants that more and we have to do it more. Because at the end of the day, when Dame has the ball in his hands and I'm being a threat as a roller, we can cause some damage.""  
&gt;  
&gt;Per Second Spectrum, the Bucks are averaging 1.18 points per direct pick when Antetokounmpo sets an on-ball screen for Lillard. That's the third-best efficiency among duos in the NBA. It's the volume of those plays that had become a question under Griffin. They are running about 9.9 on-ball screens per game, which ranks outside the top 25 among duos this season.  
&gt;  
&gt;""It's been effective,"" Rivers said Monday night, ""but it should be dominant, in my opinion.""

Some good thoughts here by Doc Rivers, specially in their PnR. If this helps get Dame more under rythym, it's just what the bucks need. For example, last year in Philly he ran about 22.6 on-ball screens with Harden and Embiid, and this season Giannis and Dame are running about 10 a game. It has to be increased for sure.

2023-10-28,1698466900,"Some notes about how Dame played last night from a Blazer fan that has been watching him for years. First of all, did you notice that Dame only took 20 shots last night?","A lot of people think Dame is like Kobe or Harden or any number of guys who put up big numbers by taking lots of shots. They are wrong.

The Legend put up 39 points on 20 shots. Going 17 of 17 from the line. This type of efficiency is why Blazers fans know Lillard is a Legit Superstar and the rest of the league thinks he is ""just"" a good to great point guard.

Also, Dame scored the last 11 points of the game for the Bucks. That's what we know of as ""Dame Time"".

One of my big takeaways was that Dame wasn't tired at the end of the game. Usually in Portland he was just gassed at the final buzzer because if he wasn't running 110% there wasn't a chance at a win.

It must be quite surreal for him to be open sometimes too! At the Blazers he was 100% the focus of the opposing team's defense and he still put up big numbers. Seeing him open and not the core element of every single play made him so much more fun to watch, not to mention lethal. He even mentioned in the post game interview how nice it was that he wasn't organizing the offense and defense all the time and has a team around him that takes care of a lot of things he was used to running in Portland.

I'm so happy for your team and I'll be watching as many games as I can! Over here in Portland we're in full rebuild mode so I'm going to follow the Bucks for the next few years.",MkeBucks,37,https://www.reddit.com/r/MkeBucks/comments/17i5vbw/some_notes_about_how_dame_played_last_night_from/

All year we got gas lit by some holier-than-thou basketball *geniuses* who swore griffin was secretly a basketball savant that was just throwing games to experiment. 

They swore that we didnt know what we were watching as they gestured at largely useless and badly interpreted lineup ratings

That he was improving game over game by giving up 130 every night for a month straight. 

Were second in the east!!! they screamed as we were going down to the wire with the 4 win Cade-less pistons for the second night in a row. 

It was obvious all year, from terrys resignation to every single report that came out of the locker room that Griffin had no idea what he was doing. The team agrees, as this doesnt happen without support from Giannis/dame/Kris (probably all 3).

Usually, whenever dame is put with a new player, he would take some time (3-4 games) getting used to it. If said new player is someone who got traded for someone else, dame would probably go out to drop 35+ points, but not too much assists.

Now that hes in a new team, with completely different skill level, hes gonna take a while to get used to the change. He is used to having the ball wayyyy more than he does now, and I think that may be a reason for his cold start.  You can see how he drops more points without giannis and in clutch moments.

Give him time till mid season and the results will not disappoint

I met Bill Clinton a couple times. So it was cool to finally meet Joe Biden. It was strange not being able to be there with the team for the White House but it was cool to kind of make a second time or second effort when he came to Milwaukee. I was definitely appreciative that I got the invite to come by and say hello. I got to bring my kids and my family so that was really cool, especially for them. One day theyll look at that picture and realize how cool it was that they got to meet and take a picture with a sitting president.

We sat for a long time, over several conversations, [about his comfort on the team and within the offense](https://www.jsonline.com/story/sports/nba/bucks/2024/02/28/damian-lillard-happy-in-milwaukee-seeks-comfort-in-bucks-offense/72750454007/) and how Doc Rivers is actively trying to make it better for him (and we're seeing it). 

But were sitting together in Denver and I just looked at him and asked, ""Are you happy?""

And he insisted, on several occasions, that he is. He just misses his kids and family. And he expounded on that with Mannix and SI. 

Look, I don't know what this summer will bring for him. But I think it's just as exhausting for him to keep hearing about how he doesn't like his situation when it has nothing to do with basketball or Milwaukee.
