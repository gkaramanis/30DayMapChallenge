2024-02-05,1707157401,Woj taking about us on the Woj Pod today. More hints that Kuzma may be here for a while,"&gt;I think this trade deadline...there's so few real sellers. And Charlotte's a seller. Brooklyn's a seller on a couple guys.  But the teams who are really really bad...who struggled or are on full rebuilds - **Washington**, Portland, Detroit - they're not trading off maybe in past years players you would think would be available. Like right now, Malcolm Brogdan *and I preface all of these guys by saying that things can change by Thursday, somebody can call and....I wouldn't say these guys are untouchable...but they're not trying to trade* - Malcolm Brogdan in Portland, Kyle Kuzma in Washington. They are not trying to trade him (Kuzma).  He's happy. Listen, like they love Kyle Kuzma, he likes that organization, signed that extension this summer, loves being in DC, he's not angling to get out of there.  

-

&gt;Bojan Bogdanovi in Detroit, we've gone a few trade deadlines and drafts where you thought - he's gonna move. And it's not necessarily the case. And I'm not saying that Detroit won't do anything, or Washington won't do anything.  I think Tyus Jones is someone in Washington, that certainly could move, he's a free agent at the end of the year.",washingtonwizards,24,https://www.reddit.com/r/washingtonwizards/comments/1ajnil5/woj_taking_about_us_on_the_woj_pod_today_more/

2023-12-30,1703906706,GAME 31 TAKEAWAYS: THE WASHINGTON WIZARDS (6-25) DEFEAT THE BROOKLYN NETS (15-17) AND RUIN DINSHITTIE'S RETURN TO THE DISTRICT,"In what was an entertaining affair, the good guys finally got on the right side of a closely contested game. It took Deni playing his best game of the season and Kuz showing out but they got the job done. Here are my 5 takeaways from tonight's win: 

1. Bullet 1 has to go to Deni. He balled OUT tonight. 21 points on 9-18 shooting is not too shabby. He was on triple double watch as he also snagged 13 boards and had 6 dimes. He looked very good tonight! Thing is this could have easily been a 30 point triple double for him, but he got unlucky with some of his dimes, and some of shots missed by a couple of inches. He also went 0-4 from the FT line which is uncharacteristic. Deni isn't a lights out FT shooter, but I saw definitive improvement there this season, and so this was uncharacteristic for him. Either way, he balled out. He hit his threes, did a great job cutting to the basket and was getting fed by Kuz and the primary ball handlers, and did a great job getting to the basket in transition. Was very good to see a game like this from Deni after a string of mid games. Now I want to see some consistency. It's time for him to finally take a step and put together a consistent stretch of games showcasing growth. Let's hope this game is the catalyst for that. 
2. Kuzma had 26 points and 8 boards on efficient shooting tonight. He was pretty quiet overall, but turned it up in the stretches we really needed him. I think he scored 10 of his 26 in the fourth where he was hitting some tough threes and step back fadeaway mid rangers. I love that Kuz is our ride or die guy in the fourth. He's not the best, but he's a fun player to watch and root for and he can get the crowd on their feet when he's on. He's not frustrating and head scratching like his supposed counterpart and Robin in Poole. Speaking of Poole, he was mostly forgettable tonight as he had just 5 points on 2-6 shooting. JP could never get it going with the Nets putting their plethora of 3&amp;D guys on him to ensure that JP stayed quiet. 
3. Wz had a 50/40 game tonight from the field and three. It was a lights out shooting night for everyone. We surprisingly only got to the FT line 7 times and only went 3-7 there. Almost had a lower FT % than three and field goal %. Would be interesting to see how many times a team has that and won. Wiz did a great job moving the ball around and finding the open shooters and hot hands. They did a great job swinging the ball to Deni, Kispy, and Kuz when those players were ""hot."" Everybody definitely ate tonight. 
4. Bench had a great game tonight. Kispy led the bench scoring with 15 points. He did a great job going 6-10 from the field and canning 3 triples. He was followed by Muskee who had 11 points and canned 3 triples himself. With Gallo out, Muskee did a great job in the backup center role. I really feel for the guy, because he's a decent role player, but there just isn't really a role for him here. Maybe we can offload him for a second to a contender. Seems like a serviceable stretch 5 off the bench and a great personality. Delon, Shamet, and Bilal combined for 16 points and they each did their part getting timely buckets and plays on the defensive end when needed. Bilal and Delon particularly shined in that department. 
5. The energy was definitely much better than the game against TOR. I'm sure not being on the second night of a back to back can do wonders, however with that being said, I also think that there was just something different about the team tonight. They played with an edge to them and really looked like they wanted this one. The Want-to was apparent. Maybe it was playing against Dinshittie? Either way, people were hustling, getting on the floor, hustling to save balls, and trying to lock down on defense (they weren't very successful, but were successful enough to grit this one out). Also can we get a shout to the crowd? I said this last post as well, but the crowds have been great as of late. Crowd did a great job giving players ovations and really getting on their feet for our guys. That's the type of reception DC is capable of giving, and the type of reception I hope these guys keep getting and get motivated by. I don't know how sustainable such turnout is (I'm accrediting higher turnout to the holiday szn) but needless to say it's nice to see and the guys show out for it. 

Overall, it was nice to see the guy finally get one in the right column even if it's bad for the tank. We do not want to lose every single game contrary to people's beliefs. We do want to get a game every four or five games so morale isn't crazy low and people chant ""sell the team"" like another franchise located in the Greater Michigan area. Anyways, we'll see how the Wiz close out the calendar year as the Hawks come to town. The Hawks did blow us out by 30 last time so we'll see if this time is any different. I will be multi tasking with my Ravens playing a critical Sunday matchup against the Fins for the #1 seed but I'll have this up on my phone or something and following along.

2024-09-10,1725987773,Washington Wizards Head Coach Brian Keefe on Open Floor Podcast,"Coach Keefe was a guest on Sports Illustrated's Open Floor Podcast with Chris Mannix. [Linked here for anyone who wants to listen](https://x.com/SIChrisMannix/status/1833530705122627944). I'll be honest: I wasn't the biggest fan of the front office sticking with him as head coach when the decision was announced. I don't hate him or anything. The hire didn't inspire much confidence or excitement. On this podcast, it was nice to listen to him talk about why he wanted to be in Washington and hear his perspective on players like Bilal and Alex Sarr. His optimism in Poole's game is great, too, because I believe he's due for a bounce-back season and so does Keefe.

One of the biggest takeaways for me was how influential the front office was in his decision for wanting to coach the team. Winger &amp; Dawkins have impressed me so far with their general approach to rebuilding his team, and it's clear that their vision is one that Keefe has bought into fully and wants to help execute. He echoes their measured approach to building toward success, and it's clear that the organization is finally aligned in a positive direction. Another great takeaway was how Coach Keefe's exposure to great teams and players as a young video coordinator/assistant coach informs how he approaches player development. It's worth listening to if you're starving for any good discussion about the team and the upcoming season, like I am.",washingtonwizards,3,https://www.reddit.com/r/washingtonwizards/comments/1fdmygw/washington_wizards_head_coach_brian_keefe_on_open/

2024-07-01,1719858753,What's up with Vukcevic?,"I completely understand signing Valanciunas. It's a smart developmental move that absolutely helps shore up the team's biggest problem, defensive rebounding. Simply being league average in that category has a domino effect of allowing the rest of the team to function more effectively. This is good developmentally for everyone, especially Sarr who is a notably bad defensive rebounder.



The only issue: the JV signing gives us four centers, assuming Vukcevic resigns as is widely expected. Maybe there are more moves coming, but I don't see teams tearing down the door to take Bagley or Holmes off our hands. There's also the issue with Kuz, who is still here and would be in the way of Sarr's development.



With all the expendable vets (Shamet, Kuz, Brodgon, and yeah, Kispert) on this team, I have to think some package deal is in the works.

Maybe more because Tommy might have had to give him more money and a longer contract to get him to stay.


EVALUATION:

So& Jordan Poole. Where do I start?

Pretty much as up and down of a season as you can get. C- is fair imo. We all know how bad he was to start the year, no need to rag on him with that. But in short he seemed super out of his element and lacked the twitch and burst he had in years prior with Golden State. Wes was notorious for utilizing him the wrong way this year, and for good reason! Poole played ~70% of his minutes at point guard last year. Itd be hard for anyone to adjust swapping positions and roles from a primary on ball creator to someone mostly playing off ball and being plopped in the corner.

Now obviously. Cant make excuses for him either, it goes both ways. He flat out had to be better. Egregiously bad decision making and lack of effort alongside questionable behavior plagued him in the first half of the year.

It wasnt an immediate shift but once Wes got fired and Brian Keefe entered the fold, Poole started to trend up again. Once he started being put in better positions he flourished and got his confidence back. Shot selections probably going to continue to be an ongoing issue with him, but hes got undeniable talent as a playmaker and facilitator. Id like to see what he can do as a full time point guard with a big that has true interior presence (like Gaff ironically) for a long stretch. 

But overall, good learning experience for him. Hella ups and downs, but he got through the year and played almost every game. Gotta give him bonus points for that. Hes earned the chance to be a full time starter next year so with Tyus most likely departing Im excited to see what he can do.

POINTS OF EMPHASIS GOING INTO NEXT YEAR:

- we need some consistency effort wise on both ends. Defensively hes proven not to be a total cone when hes locked in but we need to see that more. Hes not bad guarding the man hes assigned to but he struggles a lot with timely rotations and shifting laterally to close out on shooters quick.

- Shot selection: cool it with the heat checks. Hes gotta do a better job playing himself into rhythm if we ever want to see more consistency from him. 35 foot bombs from mid court when hes got nothing going and we still have a full shot clock, ESPECIALLY in a tight game is not a good habit to have.

- Continue making sharp decisions off screens. Pooles at his best when hes going downhill since it puts pressure on the defense, improves his shot quality, and opens up opportunities for him to make decisions to get his teammates involved. I think Keefe realizes this, so should he return next year as our full time head coach, I expect Poole to continue being put in positions regularly to hone this aspect of his game.

2023-10-29,1698596513,GAME 2 TAKEAWAYS: THE WASHINGTON WIZARDS (1-1) DEFEAT THE MEMPHIS GRIZZLIES (0-3),"Your Wiz won their first game of the season in classic Wizards fashion. By that I mean the game was far closer than it needed to be, but it wouldn't be Wizards basketball if it wasn't that. Good to see the good guys get a win and clean up a lot of the stuff from the absolute disaster of a season opener against Indy. Here are my 5 points from last night's win against MEM: 

1. Both Kuzma and Poole combined to finish for 48 points, but both of them played like utter crap. Kuzma was 1-10 from three, and Poole was 8-23 from the field. I really can't blame Kuz THAT MUCH because it seemed like the vast majority of the shots he was taking were good shots but they just weren't going down for him. Poole on the other hand is a different story. Not only does he have atrociously bad shot selection, his handle is nice but not tight. He lost the ball like 4-5 times by trying to be too fancy. He needs to make sure his handle is tight and that he doesn't try to do to much. He also had a lot of ill advised shots where he tries to create magic in the paint but he almost ends up failing always. Let's see if there's improvement over the course of the season, but we will see 40-50 shots from these guys nightly so get used to it. 
2. Kispert was on a heater in the first half. He was hitting all sorts of threes, and the Grizzlies just couldn't guard him. Unfortunately, he cooled down in the second half. Don't know how much of that can be put squarely on him because he was brought in like 6 minutes into the second half and by then it seemed like he had cooled off. It was very encouraging to see Kispert play like this because he really didn't light it up during pre-season and after the last 15-20 games of last season, I was expecting big things from Kispert. He certainly produced big last night, and I hope the offense makes it an emphasis to get him the ball and that he can get 10 shots a night. 
3. The offense flowed much more smoothly for about 3 quarters. During the back half of the third quarter and the first half of the fourth quarter, the offense sputtered to a halt. This happened against Indy as well, but when Kuz and Poole are both out, it's really not going to look good. This is where guys like Kispert, Deni, and Tyus are going to have to step up. We were up by 22 points at our apex in this game, and MEM was able to come back to 6 and make it a very close game. I really hope to see development from Kispert and Deni in particular with regards to being able to create shots and put up big numbers (15 ppg) which is very doable with the offensive carte blanche they will have with the time they have with the second unit. 
4. We were playing a very very fast paced game. We shot 46 threes, which is the most we've taken in a LONG time. We took damn near 20 threes in the first quarter. This will be the recipe for success for this team. We have a lot of shooters so taking as many threes as possible maximizes the chance for this team to put up big numbers. It was enjoyable to watch them take so many threes, but again, the one thing the team as a whole can work on is shot selection. That was outrageously bad. 
5. The defense was better, but could still be much improved. Too many times were Desmond Bane, Ziaire Williams, Smart, and the other Grizz three point shooters left open. The problem wasn't effort, though that was a factor. The main problem was there was a lot of confusion and chaos in the Wiz defense. Often times, it seemed like multiple people were guarding the same person and people weren't where they were supposed to be. It's on WUJ to instill that discipline and continuity in the guys on defense. What I really care about with this team is not the offense, because that has a ceiling with how high it can go given the obvious lack of star talent. I want to see the team become at least a respectable defensive team by the end of the year, which is a reasonable goal given the great wing defenders we have (Kuz, Deni, Bilal, and Delon). 

This was a good win tonight, but it clearly showed that the Wizards were an absolute work in progress, and that for this to be a finished polished product, it's going to take a lot of time. I will be very interested to see how the Wiz do against their first contender of the year in the Boston Celtics. Fan Favorite Tingus Pingus will be back in town but this time in the Green and White. If history is any indication, we're going to get our ass kicked, because the Celtics have been absolutely destroying us as of late, but who knows. I'll see y'all tomorrow @ 7 for what should be a blowout but maybe is an interesting game....",washingtonwizards,13,https://www.reddit.com/r/washingtonwizards/comments/17j6gqy/game_2_takeaways_the_washington_wizards_11_defeat/

2024-08-26,1724681574,Is Kuz pulling a Larry David?,"Half kidding. Half serious. Kuz seems like he'd be very happy being a lap dog for billionaires for the rest of his life, so I think his MAGA turn is real. But is there any chance this is a genius ploy to accelerate his departure from DC? Is it possible we view his contract as such an asset that he worries we will hold on to him longer than he wants?

By the way OP proposed Detroit and Chicago. But most comments without hesitation responded: Wizards.

[https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/1dbstbs/what\_team\_is\_currently\_furthest\_away\_from\_a/?utm\_source=share&amp;utm\_medium=web3x&amp;utm\_name=web3xcss&amp;utm\_term=1&amp;utm\_content=share\_button](https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/1dbstbs/what_team_is_currently_furthest_away_from_a/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button)

So I don't think Wizards is the answer to this question. Here're reasons:

It's correct that Wizards currently don't have franchise player. But it's way better than time when Wizards had ""franchise player"" in Beal which led them to absolutely nowhere. And there are several teams in NBA with such ""franchise players""

Management was replaced last year, and for now there're reasons to be optimistic:  Bilal seems to be good draft selection. Signing Deni to $55 mln / 4 years descending extension looks great now, I think that trading Beal (with his ""no-trade clause"") was most important decision, even if they got back aging Chris Paul.  Sure Beal is good player, but Wizards would be just stuck in the mediocrity (at best) loop forever with Beal as first option.

There was not much chance to get more significant value for Beal and KP (which is very good player but doesn't fit rebuild at all). The one bad decision with some implications on future was getting Poole with his massively overpaid contract for Paul. Still if he's proven to be at least serviceable as he was 2nd half of the year - his contract is not huge problem, as those 3 years will be building around guys on rookie deals and Deni on bargain contract.

Also there's a new coach which seems to be good enough coach for the team in early rebuild. He's ostensibly good in developing young players... And after Keefe took over as interim coach he looked at least competent (unlike previous two horrible coaches), and he seemed to have impact on revival of Poole after utter disaster of the season start, and Deni's break-out

Wizards were horrible last season, and probably will be very bad in the near future, but they are successful rebuild (yes, rebuild which may never happen but still...) from being contender. On other hand previous seasons Wizards were \~35 wins team, and even got once to playoff , but they were at unmeasurable long distance from being any kind of contender. And there're several such teams in NBA",washingtonwizards,60,https://www.reddit.com/r/washingtonwizards/comments/1dcngs9/why_i_dont_think_wizards_are_currently_furthest/

2023-11-28,1701188647,GAME 17 TAKEAWAYS: THE WASHINGTON WIZARDS (3-14) BEAT THE DETROIT PISTONS (2-15) IN THE TANK BOWL!!!,"In what was a slugfest between the residents of the Eastern Conference basement, the Wizards emerged on top (quite handily). Here are my 5 takeaways from last night's basement: 

1. This was a Kuz masterpiece. Another near triple double from Kuz with 32 points, 12 rebounds, and 8 assists. Kuz has consistently been getting near triple doubles the last couple of games and I'm all here for it. I've been asking for greater production in other areas besides scoring, and Kuz has stepped right up to the occasion and has exceeded even my wildest expectations. I really think this can be a 25/10 season for Kuz, but now Kuz has to work on what has always been an issue for him: consistency. He has always been capable of doing this but the issue is too often he'll go back to playing like he did against the Hawks. Consistency is the name of the game for Kuz. At this point he has nothing left to prove as far as his skillset. Everyone knows he has all the talent in the world, its up to him to show out every time he steps out on the floor, especially since he is the de facto number 1 option on this team. 
2. All our starters got into double figures this game. It was a great showing of our depth (which has been lackluster most of this season). Tyus and Gafford had a pretty average game though Gaff did have 4 blocks which was great to see. Poole was the most surprising for me. He was 5-9 and has 12 points, and the surprising part for me was that he ONLY took 9 shots. He's playing super contained and not trying to do too much, and it might not always lead to him putting up big numbers, but that's what's going to help him achieve his goal of becoming a star long term. Deni was the second best starter with a 16/6/5 game for the Wizraeli. He got a lot of his points in transition and bullying his way to the rim. One big change I've noticed all season is his willingness to just run and muscle his way to the rim in transition. That's been huge and he's been converting at a high rate there. I'm pretty sure he also got his first career 4 point play (though I could be wrong) this game. It was a nice game for Deni. 
3. A nice game from the bench as well where we got 2 double digit scorers from there: Gallo and Shamet. Gallo hit three triples and a couple shots in the paint as well. Shamet hit a couple triples and hit some tough shots near the rim as usual. An underwhelming game for Kispy (2 in a row now) where he didn't hit a single triple and got 7 points off of cuts and dives to the basket. It will be key for Kispert to figure out the consistency in his production. We know what he's capable of:  we saw that at the end of last year. It's a matter of trusting himself and hitting those shots. 
4. Don't get this twisted: we won this game because of how bad the Pistons are, not because of how good we are. The Pistons are SOOO bad. It's not even funny. It's honestly to the point where I kinda just feel bad for them. 8 top ten picks on their roster and this is the result. Don't know how that guy Troy Weaver still has his job. The Pistons missed so many open shots and layups and just everything in general. Any other team would have beat the shit out of us with the shots we were giving up. We only got away with it because we were playing another shit team. 
5. When we're blowing teams out, I really want more Bilal, Deni, and Kispert minutes. I get that Deni is a ""starter"" and Kispy is basically our ""sixth man"" but we really need those boys to get as many developmental minutes as possible. I want them taking as many shots and getting as many reps as possible, and it's little frustrating to see them get benched for the third stringers. Not saying the third stringers shouldn't get reps, but the aforementioned 3 players should be getting as close to 30 minutes as possible. I think we'll see more of that post trade deadline when Tyus, Gallo, Shamet, and JP (maybe) will be gone and a lot more minutes will open up. 

Overall, it was a good win, but not a pretty one. I really did enjoy Kuz going off though in the third. It looked like he would have another bum game back in his hometown, but he quickly shut up all his dissenters with his stellar play in the 3rd. Kuz and our young guys are the only thing that bring me joy now. Watching Kuz kill it and make an ill-advised All Star Campaign and the young guys develop every game is what I look for now. I know people want to trade Kuz, but unless a can't resist offer comes around, I really would like him to stick around and be a mentor for the young guys. He's a great mentor who has the experience to do what it takes to get to the top, and he's a high character guy. You'd be surprised how hard it is to find those sort of people these days. Anyways, I'll see y'all Wednesday when we play the second seed Magic (that was not a typo as a matter of fact).

2023-12-16,1702695068,GAME 24: THE WASHINGTON WIZARDS (4-20) DEFEAT THE INDIANA PACERS (13-10) IN CONVINCING FASHION,"In what was  a very unexpected result, the Wizards beat the high flying Indiana Pacers. Here are my 5 takeaways from tonight's tilt: 

1. Kuzma had a fantastic game tonight. Very Beal-esque in the sense that it felt very natural and unforced. When I saw he had 31 points at the end of the game I was kinda shocked. Shot well from the field, did a great job getting into the paint, and he even had an alley oop. He had 5 rebounds and 4 assists to go along with that barrage of points. It was a very good game from Kuz and one that we want to see nightly from Kuz. He's capable of it, it's just a matter of trusting his shot, staying aggressive, and using his size and length to get into the paint whenever possible. 
2. While Kuzma had a fantastic game, JP mighty have had the best game of his season. On 12-18 shooting, JP had 30 points. He also got 8 assists and 4 rebounds to go with his 30. He started off hot early and never really cooled down. He saw those first two or three shots go down and never slowed down. He played contained and didn't really force it besides heat checks which are understandable given how hot he was at points throughout the game. Really like this version of JP, but it's so hard to get it consistently. With JP it's like Jekyll and Hyde. We don't know which version we're getting with him and he has this season to work on some sort of consistency. Can't blame him because when Kuz first got here, he struggled the same. He was very inconsistent. Took him a while to realize what he had to be consistent. Maybe it's the same for Poole. We'll see. 
3. Shoutout to Tyus. I would have NEVER guessed he had a triple double. It was apparently his first triple double which is also something I would have never guessed. He did a great job playing level headed and contributing in an all around manner. It was an impressive game from the floor general. He did a great job tonight gotta give him credit. Keep that trade value going up up up!!!!
4. Wizards played with a shit ton of energy tonight. They hustled on defense, hustled on close outs, and ran like the world was falling. It was the energy that was lacking all season. The question now is can they play with that sort of energy going forward and maintain some sort of consistency. We didn't play the best defense in the world tonight. We frankly got lucky that the Pacers missed as many threes as they did, but play with that energy, grit, and hustle every night and you are bound to be competitive every night. It was fantastic and nice to see for a change from the Washington Wizards.
5. The Ouizard Bilal Coulibaly had 17 points and 5 boards and 2 steals and a block. Every game is an exciting one to look forward to with Bilal. He had a ferocious dunk, canned a couple threes, and played amazing defense. Bilal is my favorite player on this team and he is the sole reason I keep watching this team. We got a good one Wizards bros. Just gotta be patient and wait 3 seasons. It's a long time, but he's the best prospect we've had in a decade and it's not particularly close. He will pay off and he will be worth it. The two way potential, the athleticism, and even the x-factor (the shooting) are all off the charts. He's going to be a damn good player in this league for a long time. Just gotta be patient and give him the reps, and to WUJ's credit he has done a great job doing just that. Kispy had a game to remember to with 23 points. He actually only had 3 triples, he got must of his points off 3 triples and dunks and layups and cuts. Kispy has to maintain consistency though now. We know he can do this, can he do it night in and night out and be that sixth man for this team. 

This was a refreshing game to watch after the BS losses this team has taken in the past 2 weeks. Let's hope the energy and refreshing revitalized play continues. I'll see y'all when we see an old friend of ours out in the Valley on Sunday!",washingtonwizards,16,https://www.reddit.com/r/washingtonwizards/comments/18jheme/game_24_the_washington_wizards_420_defeat_the/

2024-07-09,1720554672,Dawkins Draft Appreciation Post,"I've been looking into team rebuilds around the league recently and have noticed some similarities here and there. I think it's interesting how Dawkins has chosen to rebuild the team so far.

Most teams approach rebuilding in 1 of 2 ways.

1) A team will start their rebuild by acquiring a promising guard via trade or the draft. The next steps are typically acquiring a wing, and then ending the rebuild with a big. Sometimes a team may replace the original guard they got if a more promising one is available. See below for examples:

**Cavs:** Collin Sexton (2018), Darius Garland (2019), Isaac Okoro (2020), Evan Mobley (2021)

**Hawks:** Trae Young (2018), De'Andre Hunter (2019), Onyeka Okongwu (2020)

**OKC:** SGA (2019), Aleksej Pokusevski (2020), Josh Giddey (2021), Jalen Williams (2022), Chet Holmgren (2022)

**Magic:** Markelle Fultz (2019), Jalen Suggs (2021), Franz Wagner (2021), Paolo Banchero (2022)

**Bulls:** Josh Giddey (2024), Matas Buzelis (2024)

2) The Team will choose to draft a promising wing player and place a higher value on filling out the roster via trades/free agency rather than the draft. Examples include:

**Mavs:** Luka Doncic (2018)

**Raptors:** Scottie Barnes (2021)

What I think is really interesting with Dawkins approach is that he has used strategy 1 in succession. 

2023: Traded for Poole, drafted Bilal, and Tristan.

2024: Drafted Bub, Kyshawn, and Sarr

Most teams take 2-5 years to acquire the amount of talent that Dawkins did in 1 year, and Dawkins has done it in back to back years. He has truly done an incredible job with maximizing the amount of young talent on this roster. I'm really looking forward to what this roster looks like in 3 years when we start competing in the playoffs.",washingtonwizards,36,https://www.reddit.com/r/washingtonwizards/comments/1dzbpkv/dawkins_draft_appreciation_post/

2023-11-04,1699075050,"Remember this post: 3 years from now, the Wizards dynasty will be on the horizon.","I believe this rebuild will last 3-5 years, however, after 3 years, I think we will look similar to the 2018 Celtics or 2012 Thunder.

Picture this, we grab Alex Sarr in this upcoming draft to get our center of the future. We continue to develop Bilal, and then the following year we draft Cooper Flagg.

We will have three top young prospects all of which will be 21 years old or younger.

Flagg will come in more NBA ready ala KD or Tatum, and Bilal will have hopefully developed more by then, similar to Jaylen Brown or Kawhi. Combine those two with Sarr and hopefully we will have good depth around them - whether that is good vets or other draft picks we picked up.

In the meantime, we will continue to try to leverage the vets we have on our team now for future picks.

Things may look bleak now, but in 3 years the Wizards will no longer be the laughing stock of the NBA, and us fans may finally have something to look forward to!

2024-06-01,1717278610,a deep dive on the wizards front offices draft tendencies,"What is the best predictor of future success? Past performance. For example, every mock draft has the Wizards taking Rissacher at 2. If you look to the wizards past, it makes sense. The team lacks shooting, Ted is infatuated with international prospects, and the last time we picked this high we took the safe, goofy looking 3&amp;D prospect.

However, what all those mocks forget is that we no longer have a bumbling used car salesman pretending to be an NBA GM calling the shots. Teddy Westside finally decided to bring some adults (Winger, Dawkins, and former ATL GM Travis Schlenk) into the room. Hopefully on draft night they push Ted out and lock the door.

With such an uncertain draft, I decided to take a deep dive into the draft histories of our new triumvirate. Winger started as the Clipperss GM in 2017, as did Schlenk in ATL. Dawkins became the VP of basketball ops in OKC in 2020. In the case of  Winger and Dawkins, they werent the final decision makers, but they were key decision makers on all of these picks. 

My goal is to hopefully deduce some form of preference in scouting. These preferences could range from body type, play style, team building philosophy, age, etc. 

Between the three of them theyve made 16 top 20 picks between 2017-2022. Most are by Schlenk (8), followed by Dawkins (6), and Winger (2, both in 2017). Ive organized the prospects by position into the following categories: Small Guards, Big Guards, Wings with Guard Skills, Pure Wings, Big Wings, Pure Forwards, Combo Bigs, and Pure Bigs. Ive listed the team, draft position and draft year next to each prospect. Try not to nitpick where I have these guys listed too much. 

**Small Guards**
(sub 64 barefoot, capable of running an offense)

2018 - Trae Young - 5th- ATL

2018 - Jerome Robinson - 13th - LAC

2021 - Tre Mann - 18th - OKC

**Big Guards**
(taller than 64 barefoot, capable of running an offense)

2018 - Shai Gilgeous-Alexander - 11th - LAC

**Wings with Guard Skills**
(65-69 barefoot, capable of shot creation for themselves and others)

2021 - Josh Giddey - 6th - OKC

2022 - Jalen Williams - 12th - OKC

**Pure Wings**
(65-69 barefoot, primarily off ball, limited on ball players) 

2018 - Kevin Huerter - 19 - ATL

2019 - Reddish - 10 - ATL

2022 - AJ Griffin - 16 - ATL

**Big Wings**
(67-610 barefoot, skilled enough to play on the perimeter but strong enough to switch into bigs)

2019- Deandre Hunter - ATL

**Pure Forwards**
(68-70 barefoot, perimeter skills in a bigger body, cant reliably defend the rim/defend the post/rebound)

2017 - John Collins - 17 - ATL

2020 - Aleksej Pokusevski - 17 - OKC

2022 - Ousmane Dieng - OKC

**Combo Bigs**
(68-70+ barefoot, perimeter skills in a big mans body, can reliably defend the rim/defend the post/rebound) 

2021- Jalen Johnson - 20 - ATL

2022 - Chet Holmgren - 2 - OKC

**Pure Big**
(68-70+ barefoot, can protect the rim, rebound, and defend the post, lacking in perimeter skills)

2020 - Onyeka Okongwu - 6 - ATL

**Analysis**
 
1. Personally shocked by how many small guards ended up on this list. The way people talk about these teams made me think they didnt draft anyone south of 66. In fact it seems that Schlenk doesnt value positional size much at all outside of Hunter. 

2. None of these guys value traditional big man.

3. Schlenk values shooting 

4. Dawkins puts high stock on putting the ball on the floor

**How this relates to the 2024 Draft**

Sarr is guaranteed to be number 1 on their board. Someone that big, who moves that fluidly, and likes to put the ball on the floor is definitely the type of player Winger and Dawkins like. The profile isnt even too dissimilar from John Collins, so Schlenk is probably on board too. On the flip, scrap Clingan from the big board. If he cant put the ball on the floor, these guys dont want him. Sorry David Aldridge.

But we all pretty much knew that already. What we didnt know is how much all of these guys value having a lead initiator. All these guys like starting a rebuild with a lead guard, star upside type. In 2018, Schlenk and Winger took the plunge on Young and SGA (the Clips were in a brief rebuilding phase at the time). After OKC traded for SGA, they used their first high lottery pick on another big guard-ish player in Giddey (to less than stellar returns). 

The only big guard at the top is Topic, so I would have him at the top of the Wizs board as well, tho his injuries make him an unlikely pick. However, as mentioned before, each one of these guys took a small guard before, 2 in the lottery. Sheppard still profiles as too off ball for their liking, but Dillingham is a much more attractive pick through this lens. 

As far as the wings theyve shown interest in, Rissacher doesnt really resemble any of them. Only perhaps Deandre Hunter, who was older, and more resembled what wed hope Rissacher would be in 2 years. Wingkins (thats what Im calling them now) dont care if you are a good shooter, they think they can teach it to you. They want shot creators who put stress on the defense.

Wings who fit that category are guys like Holland and Buzelis. Hardworking long athletes who attack off the catch that need seasoning. Castle could also fit here maybe, but hes a worse athlete with less creation flashes. 

Id bet if Sarr is there, hes the pick. If hes not, its Topic. If they dont like Topics medicals, then it will be one of Holland, Buzelis, or Dillingham, with the decision based off their individual workouts and interviews. 

What do you guys think?

Plenty of teams get a nice pick in the draft finishing 2nd or 3rd (last four No. 1's have come from those positions).

2024-02-13,1707802186,GAME 53 TAKEAWAYS: THE WASHINGTON WIZARDS (9-44) LOSE TO THE DALLAS MAVERICKS (31-23),"In what was once again riveting finish, the Wizards for I think the 9th straight time come up short and add one more the L column. Here are my 5 takeaways from tonight's game: 

1. Deni had a pretty good game. He had 25 points, 7 boards, and 3 dimes. He shot 11-17 from the field and did a great job getting to the rim, finishing through contact, and he even drained a triple. I loved how much he didn't settle this game. He never settled for three point shots or bad shots. I felt he made the right decision almost every time. He realized he was bigger, faster, and stronger than most people guarding him and used that to get to the basket at will and converting once he got there. Only blemish in his game tonight was a bad performance from the line as he shot 2-6 from the FT line. Deni has taken significant strides as of late, and he's REALLY starting to turn a corner. He's played the best ball of his career the last couple games and he's starting to blossom into a young star that does it all. 
2. Kuzma had an OKAY game tonight. He had 23 points and 8 boards but on 9-19 shooting. He was also 1-7 from the three point line. He had a lot of short shots from three and honestly, it just looked like he was tired out there. Those three point shots that usually go down have been short for a WHILE. I'm going to put it as Kuzma having a workload that he's just not built for. I'm sure it must be tiring when he's the number one scorer on a team with little weapons and with him grabbing rebounds, and hustling on defense as well. I hope that the ASB gives him some much needed rest and he can come back rejuvenated after the break. Not for us to win games, but for his value to go up and to get some more picks in the off-season. 
3. It's was a nice game for Marvin Bagley. 12 points and 13 boards for the big man. He had a decent game. As long as he keeps balling, I'm not mad with the departure of Gaff. Was really worried that we'd have a glaring hole at center but a guy who can consistently put up 15/10 is more than a consolation prize. If he can start hitting some of those 5-10 foot jumpers he takes a couple times a game, it will make things so much easier for him. 
4. Luka was quiet for the first 3 quarters and played super lackadaisically. He got injured when Kispert tried to take on to the hole and he drew a charge but got elbowed in the chin as a result and blood was drawn. It was from that moment on that he decided to turn it up and take shit seriously. He started cooking us in the mid range, from three, making ridiculous assists, and doing all the shit that falls into the category that is ""Luka Magic."" Bilal was his primary defender and he was playing some damn good defense and was working his ass off, but Luka's just ridiculous. Slow mo fadeaway after slow mo fadeaway and he was just too big for Bilal to be able to comfortably stop. 
5. Wizards had an atrocious night from the three point arc. They couldn't buy a shot from deep. Kispert was 1-7 from three. Kuzma was 1-7 from three. Poole was 1-6 from three. Only one who had any sort of ""success"" was Shamet who was 2-4 from deep. The lack of threes really killed us tonight. 7 threes isn't going to cut it unless you have a phenomenal game in the paint which just didn't happen tonight. 

We once again couldn't execute in the last 2 minutes, and lost the game as a result of that. I saw a lot of Kuz and Deni hate and it just doesn't make sense. Deni is playing out of his mind right now and you want him to go toe to toe with the likely MVP this year? That makes literally no sense. We also cannot blame Kuzma. He's a third option at best and we want him to close out every single game? We just have to concede that we don't have the talent to close out close games. Going to be painful but it is what it is. I'll see y'all for the last game before the break on Wed when we take on the Pelicans.

George hit a few 3s and looked decent all around.

Coulibaly looked solid in his minutes.

Sarr had a slow start but picked it up later in the game.  Very encouraging to see his 3-pt shot falling.

Bub's shot wasn't falling a ton but he did a good job getting to the basket and made a good looking and-1.

Jared butler and johnny davis looked decent in limited minutes.

In that brief moment before the final ball was selected, Washington's shot at getting the top selection had skyrocketed from 6.7 percent to 54.5 percent. Going off a subjective deserve to winometer, does the franchise with dynastic success and two of the best big men in history deserve Wemby? Are wizards fans not allowed some happiness as well? The last time I felt true happiness as a wizards fan was JW hitting the game 6 game winner on the Celtics came to my city wearing all black talking about its a funeral!!, and the sad part was that was to *almost* get to the ecf. Whatever, fuck it, we didnt get Wemby and were not a successful franchise, yes it could be worse and I sound jealous(I am), but god dammit if they cant at least just let us have this one thing. Time will tell but now Im attached to Sarr cuz someone wanting to come here isnt something were all that familiar with, even if its just for the expanded role.

2024-10-20,1729427807,Preseason Observations ,"Im a season ticket holder. Support the home team up and down. Some notes:

1) a couple of things were obvious about the players at something as simple as the meet the team party. Coulibaly, Poole, Gill, Brogdan, George, Butler, Sarr seemed like they wanted to be there. They were engaged with fans, great attitudes. There were probably others but these guys stood out. Kuzma stood out for the wrong reasons, tightening his hoodie around his face trying not to be recognized on literally the one night for meeting season ticket fans. Watching him (not) engage his teammates while the others would cluster about and joke with each other. 

- Overreaction: Kuzma is a culture killer for this rebuilding franchise. Get him out of here. Keep Brogdan as the vet hand for the young guys to emulate.

2) There are some pieces to be excited about. Trotting out Bub, George, Sarr, and Coulibaly is an exciting young group. George is looking like the biggest steal, Bub shows some real flashes of potential. Three rotation players with three picks is a great way to start.

- Overreaction: The team finally has something to be excited about.. GM is doing his job.

3) Kuzmas value isnt going to get higher than last years trade deadline. He got paid and he seems to have a bad attitude to go with the ego. His performance in the preseason suggests he wasnt putting in the work this offseason. 

- Overreaction: Trade him as soon as possible. He is checked out. Trade centered on Kuzma for active young potential to stay on timeline with Coulibaly et al is key. A trade centered on Kuzma for Knect and filler would probably make everyone happy.",washingtonwizards,18,https://www.reddit.com/r/washingtonwizards/comments/1g7xptb/preseason_observations/

He'd just pull things out of nowhere and guys like Channing frye and gooden would be surprised by the things he'd show. His shooting.. HE was getting around 15 points consistently really easily without any time to settle. Off shots, off cuts.. This output is around where Vic and Chet were offensively. He'd just score an easy 15 or 17. On team dynamics his shooting helps. He's also long enough to play C. He and PBJr as a 4/5 tandem with them being able to switch, defend the middle and shoot did really well. I looked up the numbers on cleaning the glass as well. Its legit. Spacing and interior defense when together.

I'm thinking of his comps. I guess he said Kaminsky and Porzingis.. but I see also Markannen lite but I'm having a hard time thinking of other comps and not being lazy and thinking of only white guys. But he's hard to comp.

2024-02-15,1707969267,GAME 54 TAKEAWAYS: THE WASHINGTON WIZARDS (9-45) LOSE TO THE NEW ORLEANS PELICANS (33-22),"In what was a CAREER and HISTORIC night for Avdija, the Wizards came up short in #SOWIZ fashion. Can't be a Wiz legend till you lose in the game you set a career high. Here are my 5 takeaways from tonight's game: 

1. If this wasn't Avdija on the first bullet feel like the stans would run over me. He deserves it tonight, the Wizraeli was COOKING. 43 points and 14 boards. 13-24 from the field and 6-10 from the three?! I mean it was insane. Also, I TOTALLY CALLED IT. Go check the post where Kuz was announced to be out. Anyways, he was unstoppable tonight. He looked like a total superstar tonight. He took all the right shots and hit em. The thing that was really going for him was getting to the rim and drawing contact. He did that at an ELITE level and looked like a lite version of Luka/Shai tonight that was for sure. This is the game I was looking for all season long. I'll say he's taken a step forward for sure no question about it. Whether or not he can be a star is to be seen but at the very least he'll be like a Kuzma for us, which is still very good obviously. I really wish the ASB wasn't now, because the last thing we would want is for him to lose his touch over the break and come back ice cold. Hope he keeps hooping and grinding over the break and comes back and does this again. 
2. Tyus does it again. 14 points and 13 dimes for the man. He's just so consistent and an ELITE floor general. Feel like a lot of teams will regret passing on him at the trade deadline because a LOT of contenders could've used a presence like him on their team. He was 5-7 from the field and did a great job hitting his shots and just doing his thing. Would have actually liked to see him take more shots with how he was shooting it, but it is what it is. 
3. Kispert had a good night too, but it was obviously and rightfully overshadowed by Avdija. He had 20 points and was 7-14, 5-10 from deep. He was an ABSOLUTE bucket as well from deep tonight. Aside from him and Shamet bench was eerily quiet tonight. Can't blame em because it was that type of night. With no Kuz, bench lost Bilal and there was no depth to go to. 
4. We lost this game because of all the sloppy TOs we had in the first and second quarter. We played the right way in the second half, but this should've been a comfortable win if it wasn't for our BS effort. It looked like the team locked in after they saw Deni having a career night in the second half. Terrible passes, miscommunications, and just total shitshow was happening in the first half. Ridiculous. Glad Keefe+Deni got the team back together. 
5. For those of you who don't understand why Keefe is better, this is why Keefe is better. Keefe trusts his players and that's been made clear TIME AND TIME again. It was after Keefe took over that Deni started REALLY breaking out. Before under WUJ, he was playing like a role player. Now, he started playing like a star. Look at Kispert. He's starting to show a lot more too. Bilal has plays run for him and is starting to go to the rim and do things we haven't seen the first half of the season. Keefe has his faults that's for sure, but our young guys are developing nicely and that's our #1 priority. I have to credit him for that that's for sure. 

Man, we wouldn't be the Wizards if we didn't blow a career night for our players. Anyways, REALLY happy Deni finally got this. Felt long time a coming this year with the steps he's taken. Hope we can get more of the next 25 or so games and he keeps cooking. I want him to get a ton of momentum into the off-season, and hopefully come back EVEN better the off-season. Moments like this make it all worth it to be a Wizards fan. When homegrown talent does shit like this it makes it all worth it. Anyhow, let's enjoy the ASB and hope Deni and the team comes back supercharged for the home stretch of the season and keeps showing out for us.

Despite losing a favorite player in Deni, the move was necessary.

2023-12-07,1701958184,Last night's game is how the Wizards can really grow the fan base imo,"I was watching the tickets for this game all week and saw how empty the stadium was looking. Had a feeling that at some point some of the sellers would just drop the price to get something for their season tickets and was right. Grabbed some really nice 100 level seats fairly close to the action for a steal a few hours before the game and pulled up.

The hats that were being handed out, this might be the best DC hat I have now. I also have a classic Nats red cap but this one is in all honesty the right shade of blue with the right representation and the logo is simple but effective. Big +1.

Then there was the game, and even though the Wiz are notoriously awful this season, this was a really exciting game. The real highlights were Bilal and Kispert. Kispert was electric from 3. Bilal showcased some true star potential. Poole and Kuzma both had great moments. The whole team was really playing well overall. Deni was a slight disappointment though. 

For Poole, the only clear issue is that Poole's BBIQ is still horrendous, found myself laughing at Poole when he threw the ball up for Tyus on the inbound to get the CORRECT way to not kill time while down. Someone obviously taught him that rule. However he had a chance to close the gap in the last few mins and went for a really ill advised and contested layup instead of setting something up like a proper veteran should. He didn't recognize the low opportunity that was sitting and wasted a chance to get this game close. There was also a case where Poole was guarding Embiid and somehow managed to get entangled with him for god knows why. Gave away a free foul. 

Embiid was firing on all cylinders, for whatever reason he always torches us when he comes down here. The game stayed close DESPITE Embiid being unguardable, mostly because Maxey was really quiet until later in the 3rd. 

But yes, this was easily the most entertaining game I've been to in person since the double OT vs. the Spurs maybe 2 years ago. The team is still fun to watch and the tickets were actually priced fairly. If the ticket prices continue to be low, the quality of in game handouts continues to be high, I might have to consider getting season tickets again.",washingtonwizards,17,https://www.reddit.com/r/washingtonwizards/comments/18cwe04/last_nights_game_is_how_the_wizards_can_really/

&gt; Minnesota remains active in the reserve point guard market, according to league sources. Perhaps the Timberwolves will be the landing spot for Jones, bringing the point guard back to his first franchise and his hometown area. Sources said Minnesota is also considering two additions at the position who overlapped with team president Tim Connelly in Denver: Monte Morris and Bones Hyland.",washingtonwizards,52,https://www.reddit.com/r/washingtonwizards/comments/1ah4nxo/fischer_while_the_wizards_have_stated_an_asking/

Our vision for a wholly re-imagined sports and entertainment destination will be ambitious, reflective of our community, and designed to wow our most ardent supporters as well as casual fans.

Weve rooted our plan in three goals: creating the best experience for the greatest fans in the world, building the finest destination for elite athletes and their families, and constructing the focal point of commercial economic success in Downtown DC.

This arena transformation marks the next significant investment Monumental Sports is making in the revitalization of Downtown DC, and continues our efforts to invest in neighborhoods, companies, technologies, medical facilities, and people that help make DC the greatest city on earth.

Thank you to Mayor Bowser and her staff for their excellent partnership throughout this process. This team effort has led to a wonderful day in DC and for our fans throughout the DMV!

To our fans  the heartbeat of our teams  the new arena and Downtown DC are designed with you in mind. We want you to be proud of what weve built and create lasting memories with us for decades to come.

2024-01-31,1706727294,The smartest thing the new front office has done is descending contracts,"This offseason, the new front office regime signed both kuz and Deni to new contracts. The initial numbers were jarring to some people, but when you break it down, these were great deals that will age like fine wine.

Here is what these guys will make over their 4 year contract:

*Kuzma  25.5M, 23.5M, 21.5M, 19.4M*

*Deni  15.6M, 14.4M, 13.1M, 11.9M*

Over that time, here is how the salary cap is projected to change:

*136M (this year), 149M, 164M, 181M, 199M*

__This means that in the final year of their deals, kuzma will take up ~11% of the cap and Deni will take up ~6%.__

The fact that their contracts decrease when 99% of contracts increase is brilliant with where we are at in our rebuild. Our cap sheet is fairly clean (*cough Jordan Poole cough*) so we can afford to pay the higher numbers now. They will be great values when we are starting to become competitive again, allowing us flexibility in making moves. And if it becomes clear that they will not be a part of the next great wizards team, their lower cap hit will make them more desirable in the trade market.

2024-02-10,1707574918,[Bowser] Why Washingtons sports teams should stay in Washington,"After negotiating several offers over the better part of last year, D.C. offered Monumental $500 million to be paid in three tranches beginning this year, a deal that would have provided well more than half of the estimated $800 million cost of a complete renovation that better connects the arena to the surrounding neighborhood and businesses and brings the fan experience closer to the court. The result would be a new, more profitable, state-of-the-art urban arena, with improved corporate suites and more and better entertainment options. The city would leverage our AAA bond rating to borrow without raising taxes or displacing any planned capital projects. It is unequivocally a great deal for Monumental, with near total certainty and the lowest performance risk. In fact, the D.C. Council has already unanimously agreed to advance the deal, making the initial payment to start construction available within months of the bill passage.

Our deal would mean Monumental can avoid any broken promises, breached leases or potential litigation to distract from building the most valuable regional sports company. It would mean equitable construction spending and our continued support of the Service Employees International Union and Unite Here! Local 23 workers who earn good pay and benefits in D.C. Truthfully, we still dont know whether the Virginia deal will cross the finish line or whether this gamble will work.

2023-12-16,1702742976,Bilal Coulibaly with higher usage in December:,"To start the season, Bilal's usage% hovered around 13%. [In his last 6 games he has logged 17.5%](https://www.statmuse.com/nba/ask?q=bilal+coulibaly+usage%25+last+5+games)

His counting stats: 13.8 points, 5.7 rebounds and 1.7 assists per game.

61.5 FG%

43.5 3PT% on 3.8 attempts per game

56.3 FT% - probably the most baffling part of his game. The shot looks fine. He's a great 3pt shooter. No idea if this is just a mental thing for him or something else that makes him uncomfortable at the line.

10 assists vs. 16 turnovers for a pretty bad AST/TO ratio of 0.67. His biggest problem continues to be his inability to dribble through defenders. He looks great making straight line drives to the basket, but most of the time he's probably going to lose his handle or be forced to pick up the dribble.

He's looking waaaaaay ahead of schedule, but we'll have to see how he looks once he hits the rookie wall and the fatigue catches up with him.",washingtonwizards,21,https://www.reddit.com/r/washingtonwizards/comments/18judjt/bilal_coulibaly_with_higher_usage_in_december/

His constant late game dribbling turnovers still haunt me, now hes one of the point guards

He was such a bad defender, now hes the primary defender on Ant? 

Not a PG by any means. He never could. We thought he would after Wall and Westbrook, but never took that step 

Its no wonder Phoenix is down, I was rooting for Beal and still am, but playing Gordon, Beal, and Booker is three of the same guys at different levels and somehow Beal is the best perimeter defender on the team. 

Miami made so much more sense for him, but at least we got Poole out of it who should improve next year as he gets comfortable

2023-12-09,1702109018,Deni Avdija after 21 games: 12/5/4/1stl on 53/35/81 shooting splits,"I think at the beginning of the season,  most of us were expecting him to hit a bad stretch of games like he usually does and come back down to his normal averages. While he definitely cooled down after his first 5 games, that bad stretch never came. He has very few BAD games, most of them were just pretty mid (which is a welcome change from last year), but he didn't really have  bad stretch at all, it was always one or two mid games followed by a good game.

Also I guess we will have to wait more games for his shooting splits to really take shape but he is shooting much more from inside the arc this season so I expect his fg% to remain as is. He also has 35% from three,  even after hitting 1/10 from three on the past three games. I don't expect him to shoot 40% but if he keeps it at around 35% that's already a huge step.

After three seasons waiting for him to really make a leap I think it finally happened. He is not a borderline all star, not averaging 20 and he's rarely flirting with a triple double, but his game is so much better this year with the stats backing it up. I just wish he would find consistency because even in this season, he has some games where he is scoring and stuffing stats and some games where he is barely felt.",washingtonwizards,77,https://www.reddit.com/r/washingtonwizards/comments/18e8q1t/deni_avdija_after_21_games_12541stl_on_533581/

Ive been covering the team since media day and traveled to watch their preseason games in Montreal and New York.    
  
The Wizards are in the second year of a rebuild under President of Monumental Basketball Michael Winger and General Manager Will Dawkins. Theyve got three rookies, a new coaching staff and an unfinished but intriguing roster.   
  
Id love to hear any questions you have about my thoughts on the team, the early vibes, what Ive noticed from the young talent/coaching staff, the long-term outlook or storylines that intrigue you. Looking forward to your questions and hope to answer as many as possible!

2024-07-16,1721163684,Went to the first 3 days of Vegas SL and watched Hawks + Rockets games live. Here're my initial observations and thoughts on the SL Wizards squad =Ý,"I'll start with what y'all probably didn't/couldn't see on TV:

* **Justin Champagnie TORE INTO** the young guys (Sarr/George) during the huddle at 2:58 mark in the 4th during the Rockets game
   * [***This was after a very sloppy sequence*** ](https://x.com/_nickvillalobos/status/1812807893399322987)where Kyshawn turned the ball over, Sarr eventually got the loose ball but took an ill-advised triple, missed, and Whitmore had a dunk on the other end.
   * I thought this was very important to note because it's a testament to how young and inexperienced our boys are. Its a process with them and patience is gonna be very important. It's gonna take years for them to reach their potential and theres gonna be many bumps and setbacks along the way.
* [**Justin was easily the best player on our SL team**](https://x.com/youngwizzyDFS/status/1811954508957667452). I loved the way he carried himself, he was very poised on the court and very clearly a well-respected veteran voice on the squad. [***Would love him on the roster.***](https://x.com/GregFinberg/status/1812628910707753449) The Wizards have done a great job with their G League/Go Go program.

Okay now the stuff you probably already saw on TV but ima share my thoughts anyway lol:

* **Wizards vs. Hawks**
   * ***Alex Sarr***
      * Slow start, literally. Seemed a step slow on the defensive end. Had some wild shot-blocking attempts early on which got him 2-3 quick fouls. Seemed to settle in much better after [***that 3-block sequence***](https://x.com/DuvaltoDMV/status/1811948161079886196). 
      * He is not physically imposing. Opposing teams will make sure he touches the paint as little as possible on offense, and he doesnt really have the strength to do anything about that. 
      * Hes not aggressive getting his own shot/buckets on offense, I dont think hell develop into a No. 1 option. As a big wholl handle the ball a lot, hes gotta take better care of it. 
      * Good: He doesnt need to be a No. 1 scoring option for us (thats for 2025). I think hell serve well as a secondary playmaker out of the post. All the talk about his skills as a 7-footer is correct. I love his passing already and hes clearly comfortable with the ball in his hands. His shooting form looks good too, especially from the line. I believe in his stretch potential. **HE LOVES A JAB STEP** = and it's actually pretty effective. He dropped a defender with one earlier in the game [***then hit this triple after a jab***](https://x.com/GregFinberg/status/1811956889644581105). Looks like his go-to.
      * Great: Legit rim protector. He has legit unicorn athleticism and will for sure be a threat in transition, both as an initiator and finisher.
   * ***Bub Carrington***
      * Hes going to be a fan favorite. Bucket-getter, athletic, great energy. His debut stat line speaks for itself. Likes going at his defender, good vision with his passes, fantastic effort on the boards. He looked real good at PG and Im looking forward to his development. 
      * For the most part, he took care of the ball but had bad b2b turnovers halfway through the 4th that cant be ignored.
      * +16 and it showed. Offense looked great when he was on the court.
      * **He is 18 years old. Will Dawkins cooked here.**
   * ***Kyshawn George***
      * I like his size (ø), if he can put on some muscle I like his potential as a physical 3&amp;D piece for us. 
      * Has a nice passing eye so another potential secondary playmaker for us from the wing spot.
      * Still a shooter at heart tho and his form looks good. Just dont see much in terms of creating separation for his own shot.
      * Finished a passing sequence that went Bub-&gt;Sarr-&gt;Bub-&gt;George corner 3. Great to see in person.
* **Wizards vs. Rockets**
   * Yikes lmao
   * **Sarr**
      * Way more comfortable in the midrange area, has a nice lil mid-post game. Shots and everything look much better from there despite the poor shooting night. He just left everything short this game. Def doesnt have the strength to be down in the low post often.
      * Not as comfortable from deep but like that he's still taking those shots.
      * Had a really bad game overall
   * **Vukcevic**
      * Bro got a very long ways to go on defense. On his 1st defensive possession, didn't defend the screen well at all and just watched the ball-handler take the open lane to a free layup. Didn't look interested in being good defender this game, at all. 
      * Dont love his energy. Missed a wide-open oop finish and barely made it back past the half court line before the Rockets scored off his miss.
      * He's nowhere near good enough on offense for his defense &amp; energy to be that bad.
   * **George**
      * They tried him as a primary ball-handler for a few possessions in the first half which I was happy about cause I want them to tap into any potential as a playmaker. Unfortunately, it didnt go well, at all. A lot of sloppy dribbling and passing TOs (6 total).
      * Great shooter, looks very comfortable pulling up from deep (75% this game) especially off the catch.
   * **Bub**
      * Aggressive. LOVE how he attacks the boards, gets paint penetration and pulls up with confidence
      * All of that is going to lead to some sloppy TOs and bad shots. There will be growing pains with him. Didnt like his shot selection today and was very inefficient despite the high-scoring effort.
      * That being said I dont think hell be one to shoot us out of games. He still looks to play-make and get his teammates some looks. ",washingtonwizards,16,https://www.reddit.com/r/washingtonwizards/comments/1e4zs3i/went_to_the_first_3_days_of_vegas_sl_and_watched/

Thanks to everyone who participated in this! For the most part, this looks pretty accurate to me. What do you all think? Any other superlatives (earnest or otherwise) you want to throw out there? 

For me, the big takeaway is that as a fanbase, the most vocal of us probably aren't as well-versed in this franchise's history pre-1990 as we could be. Like, I think we know most of the key names, but I don't think most of us could break down their games. There's obvious respect for the Unseld/Hayes glory days, but there were other role players from the era that we don't really know anything about.

He is going out there and giving his all every night, has great body language, and is coaching up the young ones when he can. He looks like he gives a damn and he has cut down a lot on the hero ball. I think hes a better leader now than Beal ever was. 

Dude is averaging 25/7/3 in only 29 mpg (6 less than last year) so far on 50/35/83 shooting splits.

No one would go so far as to call it an overpay, but there was agreement that this was a strong return for a Wizards team that entered the day pretty loaded with big wings in Avdija, Bilal Coulibaly and Kyle Kuzma. Additionally, two of those sources felt that while Avdija is terrific, hes ultimately going to be more beneficial to a team that is trying to win now as opposed to in the early stages of a rebuild.

2023-11-17,1700192434,Bilal Coulibaly has been a top 5 rookie in the early days of the season. He has the potential to be a true game changer on both sides of the ball,"Bilal Coulibaly is the 19 year old Mets teammate of Spurs revolutionary big man Victor Wembanyama. Wemby was quoted as saying that Bilal was ""undoubtedly a top 5 pick."" That may have caused some to raise their eyebrows, but 11 games into the season, Bilal has validated that claim by Victor. Here is where Bilal ranks when it comes to some traditional stats amongst rookies: 

1. Top 6 in minutes per game behind: Ausar Thompson, Chet Holmgren, Victor Wembanyama, Jordan Hawkins, and Brandon Miller
2. Top 9 in points per game behind: Wembanyama, Holmgren, Hawkins, Miller, Thompson, Sasser, Jaquez Jr, and Sasser. 
3. Top 7 in rebounds per game behind: Thompson, Wembanyama, Holmgren, Lively II, Camara, and Miller. 
4. Top 9 in assists per game behind: George, Thompson, Sasser, Micic, Holmgren, Wembanyama, Jaquez Jr, and Podziemski
5. Top 3 in steals per game behind: Thompson and Jaquez Jr. 
6. Top 5 in blocks per game behind: Wembanyama, Holmgren, Thompson, and Lively II 
7. Top 7 in 3P% behind: Miller, Pickett, Wallace, Ford, Micic, and Smith Jr. 
8. Top 5 in defensive rebounding behind: Wembanyama, Thompson, Holmgren, and Lively I

Now for the Advanced Stats: 

1. Top 4 in Defensive Win Shares behind: Holmgren, Camara, and Podziemski
2. Top 4 in TS% behind: Wallace, Lively II, and and Holmgen. 
3. Top 6 in Value added behind: Lively II, Thompson, Sasser, Wallace, and Jaquez Jr.
4. Top 6 in Estimated Wins added behind: Lively II, Thompson, Sasser, Wallace, and Jaquez Jr.
5. Top 8 in Deflections behind: Wembanyama, Thompson, Jaquez Jr., Wallace, Camara, Vezenkov, and Miller
6. He is doing all this while being 44th in USG% !!

  
If this wasn't enough to convince you of his elite two way ability as a rookie and him being a top 5 rookie thus far, let's look at the progression that he has made since has come into the league. Bilal is a quick learner and has improved every game has stepped out on the floor. These are his statlines the first 10 games: 

&amp;#x200B;

[You can see the clear progress that he has made in the last 4 games compared to the first 5 games. He took a couple games to get adjusted to the speed of the NBA, and type of physicality and type of play at the highest level, but once that was done, he has started to take leaps forward in every game since then. He starts with the game against CHA where he puts up 10 points, 2 rebounds, and 1 assist. This is the foundation for the next 3 games in each of which he sets a career high. The BKN game is his career high where he scores 20 points on 4-7 from deep. The biggest criticism of the 19 year old coming into the league was not being able to shoot, but in the last 5 games he has shown that his jumper is more than serviceable. He is shooting a blistering 47&amp;#37; from deep. His shot mechanics look incredibly fluid. It is much improved from his days with the mets. Look at this video from when he was with the Mets: https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=P5aePwsAuB8. ](https://preview.redd.it/zxik405fut0c1.png?width=1264&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=37ccebaaee042c8c60074e0e3ba13344944d4d65)

This is much improved now. This goes to show this kid's work ethic. Look at the BKN game: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A9SsCMGEOB4](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A9SsCMGEOB4)

One of the keys to success in this league is the ability to get better ever single time you're out there and he seems to be doing that early on. He's working his tail off to get better. If becoming a decent shooter and addressing your number 1 concern as a prospect wasn't enough, he also got 7 rebounds twice and then 8 rebounds his last game. He's emerging as an under the radar favorite to lead the Wizards in rebounding because of their lack of bigs. His length and unique fit as a combo wing allows him to be in the right spots to snag up rebounds (especially defensive rebounds). 

&amp;#x200B;

It has only been 11 games, but the future looks bright for the kid from France. He is an early favorite to be on the All-Rookie teams. He will undoubtedly be a player that people will look back on at the end of this season, and say ""he was much better than we expected."" The key to this kid's success has been his impact on BOTH ends of the floor. Many of the rookies have done great on either offense or defense, but he has managed to be impactful on both ends of the floor as a player coming off the BENCH. His impact in limited minutes is nothing short of impressive. Most of the people he was trailing in the stats are full time starters and the first, second, or third option on their respective teams. He is undoubtedly a diamond in the rough.

2024-07-07,1720377686,The Will Dawkins era so far,"Kicks ass. Well at least relative to what weve gotten used to in DC, it feels great to have a direction. It is important to remind myself this is going to take years to come together, but its hard not to be excited. This is the rebuild weve been hoping for ever since the John Wall Marcheesy Gorteesy power duo split up. 

The idea seems to be prioritizing young players (duh) with great size, feel, and defensive upside. This is a very welcome departure from lineups running 3 Raul Netos at a time. Bilal, Sarr, Bub, and Kyshawn George all fit that mold, and all bring legitimate basketball skills as well.

The roster needs to be torn down even further, and I believe the new front office has shown the willingness to do that. Trading Deni was a little emotional for us, but practically it was a great move for all sides. We are not going to be good through the contracts of Deni, Kuzma, and whatever Corey signs next so itd be best for all parties if we are able to trade those other two for picks as well (hopefully picking up one more 2025 FRP somewhere in there).

Im excited about the players we drafted, but initially I had a lot of concern with how we could develop Sarr. It would feel pretty classic Wizards to draft the top guy in the class, who wants to be here, and completely fumble his development. I think it really does a disservice to the player and stunts their growth when the idea is hes a good 4, but in time he can put on weight and bE a CeNtEr. If hes a good 4, let the man play the 4 and occasionally go to the 5 while his body is built this way. If he grows into a more pure modern 5, great. Its crucial to remember these are young guys still growing and developing their coordination and agility. The right approach to take is to let Sarr get as much practice and reps working on his movement, defense, and perimeter skills as possible. The wrong approach with guys built like him is to force him to play the 5 almost exclusively right away, which couldve happened out of necessity. I wouldve hated seeing the first 2-3 years of his development wasted smoking layups in traffic and getting beat up by Embiid. Thats not good for physical or mental development, and feels like how weve seen so many players with potential bust in the past. This is why signing Vananciunas was the absolute perfect move, and not something I think we wouldve done in the past. We now have the ability to allow Sarr to develop naturally as an all around player, because there isnt a necessity for him to fill minutes at the 5. This could be tinted by the fact that I see Sarr as developing (best case) into a player like Evan Mobley. I loved how the Cavs put him next to Allen, letting Mobley play his game and developing into a big, athletic, mobile defensive MENACE that is not ball dominant. And as a result, now when Mobley plays the 5 hes phenomenal because he was able to develop his skill, coordination, and feel early and didnt have to struggle as a skinny 20 year old 210lb center for most of his minutes. Sarr needs work on his shot IQ and his shot in general, lets let him get those reps in for the first few years while were still not exactly winning the finals. When its time to compete, hell be a better player for it and who knows who will be playing which positions for us at that point.

2023-11-30,1701351676,It is integral that we trade Kyle Kuzma this year.,"After the 2021 season, Allstar Bradley Beal was finishing a very impressive campaign. He had averaged 30 PPG, almost capturing the scoring title, and had announced loudly to the league that he was a legit star and surely one of the best guards in the NBA. He was around 28 years old. Unfortunately, the team around him was one of the worst in the NBA. While Westbrook had enjoyed a nice season with us, it was clear that his efforts were fruitless and we moved off his contract, ushering in the new era... or so we thought, as we kept Bradley Beal.

2 years later, Bradley Beal's trade value, while still solid, plummeted. We got an old Chris Paul, which we turned into a 32 million dollar Jordan Poole. Before, we could have likely gotten a top-5 pick and maybe more! As a non-playoff team, we made a terrible mistake allowing our best player to peak on a losing team and overlook their value.

Fast forward to today, Kyle Kuzma is averaging 23.4 PPG (25th in the NBA), 6.1 rebounds, and 4.8 assists. He is also 28 years old. He is peaking and we are 3-15. Do not make that mistake again. ***We kept Wall too long. We kept Beal too long. Do not keep Kuzma too long; trade him in his prime.***

2024-03-13,1710340121,Deni Avdija has found himself [OC Analysis],"*\[Hi, all! I originally posted this for the broader NBA audience at* r/nba *to give a little more shine to Deni Avdija, so forgive any of the obvious no-duh stuff for Wiz fans in here. Hope you enjoy it!\]*

Calling this a lost season for Washington does a disservice to the Wizards. After finally trading Bradley Beal in the offseason, this was always going to be a transitional year, although its fair to say the on-court product has been even worse than expected.

Thankfully, the Wizards have found something in fourth-year player Deni Avdija. Or perhaps its more accurate to say that Avdija found something in himself.

\[Thanks all for reading! As always, [I've collected a ton of illustrative video clips and GIFs that you can find here](https://www.basketballpoetry.com/p/the-wizards-deni-avdija-has-found) or at the links throughout the article, conveniently compiled in-context in one place.\]

A sturdy 69, Avdija made a name for himself in Washington with defensive play early in his career, but his offensive role was always uncertain thanks to a shaky jumper and unclear roster fit. However, a series of transactions and ailments have resulted in complete rotational upheaval: the Wizards traded starting center Daniel Gafford before the deadline, bought out reserve guard Delon Wright, moved Jordan Poole to the bench (which has somewhat revitalized the helter-skelter shooting guard), and dealt with injuries to new starting center Marvin Bagley.

Besides missing a few games due to his own minor injury, Avdija has been the biggest beneficiary of all those missing shots and touches. After growing his role in January, Avdijas usage [spiked up to 22% from February onwards](https://www.basketball-reference.com/players/a/avdijde01/splits/2024)  in the neighborhood of players like former teammate Kristaps Porzingis and Spurs guard Devin Vassell.

Usage is the percentage of a teams plays that a player uses by taking a shot, assisting a teammate, or turning it over. Interestingly, Avdija  a good passer  is assisting less often in his current hot streak than he was earlier in the year. Instead, he has made a concerted effort to get up shots (particularly at the basket, where [he takes half of his attempts](https://cleaningtheglass.com/stats/player/4753#tab-shooting_frequency)). Hes taking more than four additional shots per game since February started, [up to 13.2 FGA](https://www.nba.com/stats/player/1630166/shots-dash?DateFrom=02%2F01%2F2024&amp;DateTo=) from 9.1.

Thats a lot of new shots!

Avdijas emergence culminated with a 43-point outburst against the Pelicans on Valentines Day, the fourth straight game in which he scored at least 20 points. After missing a few games with injury, hes continued scoring between 14 and 18 points in each of his last seven, a notable improvement for the career nine-point scorer.

The inflection point began in January when coach Wes Unseld moved to the front office and assistant Brian Keefe was promoted to head honcho. Keefe has empowered Avdija to handle the ball more (hes setting a career-high in touches this season, and recently, hes [averaged 64 touches per game](https://www.nba.com/stats/players/touches?CF=PLAYER_NAME*E*deni&amp;DateFrom=02/01/2024)  just a few below Steph Curry and Mike Conley).

Washington [has the fastest pace in the league](https://www.nba.com/stats/teams/advanced?dir=A&amp;sort=PACE), and Avdija is grabbing-and-going more than ever. The Wizards roster upheaval has forced the team to use smaller lineups, but Avdija is *feasting* on the boards. After averaging a tad over six per game for the first half of the season, he has reeled in nine per contest since while posting[ one of the leagues best rebounding rates](https://cleaningtheglass.com/stats/player/4753#tab-defense_rebounding) for a forward.

Avdija has long been empowered to bring the ball up off live rebounds, but hes not doing it for fun anymore. Where in the past he mightve looked for a kickout for a corner three or pulled up to reset the offense, now hes looking for someone to Hulk smash for a bruising layup: \[[video here!](https://www.basketballpoetry.com/p/the-wizards-deni-avdija-has-found)\]

Avdija uses his shoulders like sweaty, pasty battering rams. Even in a halfcourt setting, he is hunting weaker players and running them over like so much roadkill: \[[video here](https://www.basketballpoetry.com/p/the-wizards-deni-avdija-has-found)\]

Its not just strength thats fueling his success. On the rare occasions Avdija doesnt get the rebound himself, hes sprinting to the hoop in transition, where teammates are doing a good job finding him: \[[video here](https://www.basketballpoetry.com/p/the-wizards-deni-avdija-has-found)\]

Theres a reason they call the man Turbo, and its not because he casually jogs around.

His newfound aggression translates in the most fundamental way, too: Avdija is dunking the ball at a higher rate than ever. The [average NBA player actually dunks less often (as a percentage of total shots) as their career goes on](https://fansided.com/2023/02/07/lebron-james-dunk-aging-curve/), but Avdijas putting up the best dunking mark of his career. This takeoff from behind the dotted line showcases his underrated athleticism: \[[video here](https://www.basketballpoetry.com/p/the-wizards-deni-avdija-has-found)\]

The key to Avdijas offensive sustainability, however, might be his improved three-pointer. After coming into the season with a revamped, higher-arcing shooting form, Avdija isnt taking many more threes, but hes making a lot more. After shooting around 31% in his first three seasons, Avdija is nailing 40% of his triples this year. Hes still only taking three triples per game (four since February), but defenses no longer treat him like a plague monster. Even given his low volume, defenders feel obligated to at least attempt a close-out, opening room for Avdijas dribble-drive game. The new attention allows Avdija to decisively catch defenders off-guard, utilizing a quick burst to get past scrambling defenses and get to the rim: \[[video here -- poor Jaime!](https://www.basketballpoetry.com/p/the-wizards-deni-avdija-has-found)\]

Of late, Avdija has been driving far more than he has in previous seasons ([10 times per game](https://www.nba.com/stats/players/drives?CF=PLAYER_NAME*E*deni&amp;DateFrom=02/01/2024&amp;Season=2023-24)  about the same as Paolo Banchero and Tyrese Haliburton). In those forays to the paint, hes been passing less and shooting more. He almost always goes to the right: per Synergy, Avdija drives right three-fourths of the time, barely ever going straight or left. That predilection towards his strong hand will be a problem in the long run, but young players usually need to develop some level of ambidexterity. Smart defenses have already begun shading him heavier to the left, and well see more of that until Avdija can prove he can make them pay with his [sinister ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dexter_and_sinister)side.

More defensive attention, in general, has highlighted one major problem for Avdija: a penchant for truly terrible turnovers. Those bruising drives result in a fair number of charges, and they arent exactly judgment calls: \[hilariously [blatant offensive foul video here](https://www.basketballpoetry.com/p/the-wizards-deni-avdija-has-found)\]

And while Avdija has very good vision for forward, he doesnt always put the right touch on passes, floating them past rim-runners or lofting easily intercepted softballs to shooters. When he puts his head down and gets to the rim, if the shot isnt there, his instinct is to force-feed whoever is sitting in the dunker spot. It often ends poorly: \[[video here](https://www.basketballpoetry.com/p/the-wizards-deni-avdija-has-found)\]

(His teammates do not have great hands, and plenty of perfectly acceptable passes are fumbled away, but this is still mostly a Deni problem.)

Turnovers are a natural byproduct of a young player expanding into greater space. When you give a toddler a mail-order toy, some packing peanuts inevitably fly. Messes are to be expected. Avdija is handling the ball far more than before and feeling out what works and what doesnt. Many of his issues are addressable, particularly as he matures and tightens his handle and decision-making, but they still stick out right now.

In general, Avdija has been more aggressive and less hesitant this season. His straight-line drives add a little oomph to a Washington offense that lacks it otherwise. Avdija isnt meant to be a first or even second option on offense in the long run, but weve rarely seen him even pretend to be a scorer in his first three seasons. This new mindset is a welcome development.

Defensively, Avdija remains unusually flexible. He ranks second in [Bball-Indexs defensive versatility metric](https://www.bball-index.com/leaderboards-tool/) for all players who have played at least 1,000 minutes, and his list of [most common matchups](https://www.nba.com/stats/player/1630166/head-to-head) includes Jalen Brunson, Luka Doncic, Paolo Banchero, Jimmy Butler, and Giannis Antetokounmpo.

The Wizards often station Avdija as the last line of defense. Avdija has played a little bit of small-ball center, but even when hes guarding a forward, coach Keefe positions him aggressively. Hell have a foot in the paint despite guarding decent outside shooters, but hes a good enough close-out artist to sprint back and bother his mark when the ball swings their way. If hes guarding a non-shooter? Hell be so deep that he has to watch for a defensive three-second count.

Despite Avdijas size and athleticism, his relatively short arms limit his steals and blocks. But hes positionally sound and takes a lot of pride in defense, a rarity on a Washington team with [the worst defensive rating in the league. ](https://cleaningtheglass.com/stats/league/fourfactors)The team surrenders [5.7 more points per 100 possessions](https://cleaningtheglass.com/stats/player/4753/onoff#tab-team_efficiency) when hes on the bench, in the 90th percentile and the starkest on/off split of anyone on the team.

Strong on/off numbers have been a[ consistent theme for Avdija](https://cleaningtheglass.com/stats/player/4753/onoff#tab-team_efficiency) over each of the last three years. The team is simply better when Avdija is on the floor. Avdija wont be a consistent 30-point scorer, but the ability to hit open threes and a new willingness to attack the hoop put his ceiling on stilts. If he can up his volume a little bit more, he profiles as a good starter on a playoff team. He has the exact mix of ballhandling and passing that a tertiary starter needs to be a plus playmaker, and a little less offensive responsibility and a little more experience should alleviate the turnover problem. The defense will get him on the floor, while the shooting  if real  will keep him there longer. Playoff teams are desperate for jack-of-all-trade players with positional versatility, so if Washingtons rebuild goes slowly and they want to stockpile more assets, Avdija could be an intriguing, high-value trade chip down the line.

Is this the sexiest storyline? Will Deni Avdija earn any end-of-year awards? Is he a future superstar? Probably not. But even in the turbid waters of the Potomac River, there are glimmers of hope to be found in the muck. Not every player has to be a household name to be an important contributor. Avdija is becoming the exact sort of player every winning team needs to complement their alpha dog.

With rookie Bilal Coulibaly showing intriguing flashes (particularly on defense) and two first-round picks in this years draft, Washingtons reload is coming. At just 23 years old, Avdija can be a capable (if imperfect) steward of the team through the next few years. And when the Wiz are ready to compete again, Avdija will be squarely in his prime and ready to show off his winning attributes.",washingtonwizards,48,https://www.reddit.com/r/washingtonwizards/comments/1bdsufq/deni_avdija_has_found_himself_oc_analysis/

After 49 games and 2.4 threes attempted per game it seems Deni is finally shooting well from three. He is mostly shooting catch and shoot threes but still, he was shooting 29%(!) last season. I was saying before the season that if he finishes the season with 33% from three that's already a good step forward for him but this mf is shooting 10% more than last season. I still don't consider him a shooter, mainly because of his inability to shoot of the dribble, but his efficiency from three was probably the key for many good games from him throughout this season.",washingtonwizards,24,https://www.reddit.com/r/washingtonwizards/comments/1akc1ww/deni_avdija_is_shooting_391_from_three_this/

Wizards fans are no strangers to the rest of the league and its fans not taking us seriously. Many of us cope by leaning into that mindset ourselves. No one roasts the Wizards better than Wizards fans. But at what point do we stop with the self-deprecation and start actually taking this organization seriously? 

My two cents: Even if this rebuild falls flat on its face, it will at least have come under a regime that actually takes the draft seriously. It will have come with Ted finally getting onboard with something other than being mid in perpetuity.

2023-11-02,1698965703,Does this sub not know what tanking means or is it just me that is stupid?,"I write this not to attack you folks but genuinely to understand if I'm missing something.

Do we have any goal this season besides player development for the young guys and increasing value of the more established players?

After the Celtics game it seemed like y'all expected to play a competitive game without our starting center. We are a team that is not even trying to win and our missing the better center out of our two. The Celtics on the other hand are title contenders. What the hell do you expect apart than a blowout win for them? Hell I mean look at the Pacers last night, they got blown up by 50 and they are much better than us (evident by their 20 point win over us). We had an awful game but that's just to be expected considering the circumstances. They were blowing us out even in past seasons where we were still competing.

Also there was this thread earlier about moving Deni to the bench. The comments pointed out that Deni is important to the starting five thanks to his defense and rebounding or whatever. And that helps us how exactly? Did I miss something? Are we trying to win again? IDK but if I'm the Wizards I'm looking to get Deni more touches so he can develop his pretty lackluster offensive game (at least judging by past seasons). That's not something he can do with Kuz and Poole on the court (contrary to Kispert and Gaff who are much better than him off ball). Why should we care that he helps the starting five with defense and rebounding when he can probably improve his game more effectively coming off the bench?

I think we can allow ourselves to try and win every now and then (and in the in-season tournament) for the moral of the team but like why are y'all so stressed about how good we play?",washingtonwizards,107,https://www.reddit.com/r/washingtonwizards/comments/17mgaxm/does_this_sub_not_know_what_tanking_means_or_is/

## Which rookie will turn out to be the biggest draft steal?

**Bub Carrington**, Wizards: 5 votes  
 **Kel'el Ware**, Miami Heat: 3  
 **Terrence Shannon Jr.**, Timberwolves: 3  
 **Matas Buzelis**, Chicago Bulls: 2  
 **Kyle Filipowski**, Utah Jazz: 2  
 **Dalton Knecht**, Lakers: 1  
 **Jared McCain**, Philadelphia 76ers: 1  
 **Jamal Shead**, Toronto Raptors: 1  
 **Cam Spencer**, Grizzlies: 1  
 One voter preferred not to answer

Many  around the league are bullish on the long-term prospects for Carrington, who turned 19 last week and whom the Wizards maneuvered into the 14th pick to select. He had a solid showing at summer league and  looked very comfortable, particularly for his age, appearing to be a strong development bet for Washington. 

""\[Carrington\] has the size, quickness and game to be an All-Star,"" one Western Conference executive said. ""I see some \[Tyrese\] Maxey in the way he plays.""

""I think he will turn out to be the best pick that Washington made in this draft,"" another voter offered. (The Wizards also selected Alex Sarr at No. 2 and Kyshawn George at No. 24.)

Both Ware (No. 15) and Shannon (No. 27) had strong showings in Las Vegas.

Ware was a pleasant surprise, helping lead the Heat to the summer league title and performing like one of the top bigs at the event. He has continued to assuage concerns about his consistency and competitive motor, and landed in a strong situation with the Heat, who will develop him as a long-term answer at center next to Bam Adebayo.

""It's undeniable what Ware can do skill-wise,"" one voter said. ""Based on summer league and what he might become, he has to be considered one of the better picks.""

Shannon's explosiveness and defensive playmaking stood out in Las Vegas, with his first two games in particular leaving a good impression. He scored 25 points against New Orleans and 19 against Indiana and recorded multiple blocks in both games. His slide to the 27th pick could give Minnesota a useful bench contributor next season.",washingtonwizards,30,https://www.reddit.com/r/washingtonwizards/comments/1eir97l/espn_polled_polled_20_nba_executives_and_scouts/

2024-04-08,1712565037,Deni Avdija is averaging a monstrous 26.5/9.5/3.3 in 6 games without Kuzma,"I tried looking at the numbers of Poole and Kispert hoping for the same results but while they are better, their efficiency isn't. Without Kuz, Kispert's efficiency drops and Poole remains inefficient, contrary to Deni who is actually extremely efficient while he's at it with 58/39/78 shooting splits and 61.1% TS (good for third best in the league).

While I do like Kuz's presence on the team (and his occasional big performances) it seems like his absence forces players into a bigger role, immensely helping player development.

2023-12-02,1701486262,Get Jordan Poole off my TV,"I know if we're to have any hope of trading him, he has to play so he can rehab his image.

But we have to balance that against the real harm that playing him is doing to this team. On defense, we're playing 4v5 whenever he's out there.

On offense it's not any better. Metrics like VORP &amp; WS/48 have him as literally the worst player in the league this year. You could without hyperbole say he's been both the worst offensive AND defensive players this year.

At what point do we just bench him and accept we'll have to eat the rest of this contract? Halfway through the season?

We all expected a tanking season. But we didn't expect a single player bringing everyone else down, possibly stunting other players' growth, and just being an overall embarrassment. Go Wiz",washingtonwizards,119,https://www.reddit.com/r/washingtonwizards/comments/188u1yy/get_jordan_poole_off_my_tv/

2024-02-29,1709245750,That One Time John Wall Gave Me &amp; My Daughter Courtside Seats.,"&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/zaeppsleollc1.jpg?width=3626&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3a21133b90ecc796330de9f72d9d680400874176

In November 2019, my daughter (she was 6 at the time) and I went to a Wizards game. She did the pregame clinic, which gave us seats in the 400 level nosebleeds. She had to use the bathroom at the end of the 1st quarter, because kids.

When we come back to our seats, the usher stops us and says ""*hey, hold up, someone wants to talk to you*"". We turn around and the Wizards PR lady (I think her name is Sashia) says ""*ya'll wanna go sit courtside?*"" Of course we think this is a joke, but she's dead serious. She says ""*you'll be sitting in John Wall's family seats*"". This was John's final season here, and since he wasn't playing, I guess the seats were empty.

So we take the elevator down with the PR lady. She tells us ""*John likes to give his seats to Dads with kids, he does this all the time.*"" A few moments later, we are indeed, sitting courtside, right beside the Beal family. Of course I'm thinking ""*there's gotta be a catch here*"". The PR rep tells us she'll come get us after the game because John wants to meet us. My daughter and I are completely mind blown.

At halftime, we get to go in the back lounge where there's all sorts of free food and drink. I'm texting everyone I know like ""*this is unreal*"". We get back to our seats, soak in the game, get on TV, the Wizards end up coming from behind to beat the Hornets, after Jordan McRae (of all people) hits the game clinching basket!

The game ends, the PR folks come to fetch us and we go to an area in the back. After a few mins, John comes out, daps us up like we're family, takes a billion photos with us, does a Snapchat with my daughter, signs her shirt, hands her a bag of Wizards goodies and wishes us well. He also gave my daughter some tips on improving her handle. He probably spent 5 minutes with us, which was *waaay* more than he needed to. He was the most humble, grateful pro athlete I've ever had the pleasure of meeting, and he made me Father Of The Year.\*

I don't think I'll ever love another Wizard as much as I loved this guy. He's from my hometown. He's the most NC dude ever. He reminds me of every cousin I have still living in the Triangle Area. I hate how this franchise just discarded him, and I hate that injuries ended his career prematurely.

But this man gave me and my daughter a memory that'll last forever.

^(\*) *^(He also completely ruined Wizards games for my daughter, because she doesn't wanna go anymore if we aren't sitting courtside, but that's neither here nor there.)*",washingtonwizards,31,https://www.reddit.com/r/washingtonwizards/comments/1b3dhfi/that_one_time_john_wall_gave_me_my_daughter/

I was against the tank, but it's been a lot easier to watch these games and stomach the losses knowing what the team is working towards vs. being a perpetual 30-win capped-out squad",washingtonwizards,54,https://www.reddit.com/r/washingtonwizards/comments/1bahivx/opinion_its_been_easier_to_watch_the_wizards/

2024-01-14,1705250146,Pistons fan coming in peace. Just a heads up: Bagley is TERRIBLE,"Just wanted to stop by and let yall know not to be deceived. Bagley is a bum. He has zero (I mean absolutely zero) court awareness. Especially on defense. He doesnt understand rotations. Despite being a great athlete he cant stay in front of his man to save his life. Routinely in bad rebounding position. Looks like a chicken with his head cut off 99% of the time. 

He also sucks offensively. Yet again, dont be deceived. He brings nothing on that side of the ball except for a quick second jump. Scorer off the bench? Hardly at all. He thinks hes prime Tim Duncan with HoF post moves. Nope. He just ball hogs and stalls the offensive. Does not have an outside shot to save his life. If it isnt a layup off a broken play, he isnt scoring the ball. 

Just want to warn yall. If you think hey, Bagley could be a diamond in the rough he really is not. Hes getting paid about $13 million too much next season. I wish I was kidding cause he seems like a decent guy (Im just very happy hes not on my team anymore).",washingtonwizards,103,https://www.reddit.com/r/washingtonwizards/comments/196jv2a/pistons_fan_coming_in_peace_just_a_heads_up/
