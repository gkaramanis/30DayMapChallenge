He has okay stats and sometimes looks dynamic but his impact on the game is not game changing. He still gets outmatched by physical big men and his switching has not been on display in a drop scheme. His lack of offense and free throw shooting will always hinder us. Hes great with other stars so he can finish and do the dirty work (looking at you OKC) but for our team, hes not it. 

We should have traded him for a first round pick but of course Sean has overleveraged this team and now were stuck with paying him 20M just to retain the asset. Unreal.  ",GoNets,111,https://www.reddit.com/r/GoNets/comments/1b9np2w/so_whats_the_verdict_on_clax/

2024-02-26,1708988984,Seerat Sohi of The Ringer grades every NBA team and is harsh with her her Brooklyn Nets analysis,"&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;Brooklyn Nets: F  
&gt;  
&gt;**Season record: 21-35**  
&gt;  
&gt;The Barclays Center has the energy of a dilapidated WeWork building: empty, aside from spare parts that remind you of the Nets once promising auspices and cataclysmic failure, the muted color palette and plain hardwood suggesting a preference for versatility and functionality over a set-in-stone identity. Thats exactly who the Brooklyn Nets, worse in record than talent, are: a team that cant decide what it wants to be and isnt doing much of anything as a result.  
&gt;  
&gt;The front offices decision to fire Jacque Vaughn, who hasnt commanded much respector much of an offensedoesnt come as a surprise. Vaughns sign-off in his farewell to the Nets included the phrase amor fati, meaning to love ones fate, which is a nice sentiment reflecting both his positive spirit and his rudderless approach to Xs and Os. He always felt like a high-end developmental coach miscast as a head honcho.  
&gt;  
&gt;The guy the Nets want to build their franchise around, Mikal Bridges, expressed frustration with Vaughn all season, from his tepid [response](https://www.si.com/nba/nets/news/mikal-bridges-unhappy-with-brooklyn-nets-rest-choices-against-milwaukee-bucks) to Vaughns rest strategies to his advocacy for Cam Thomas to start. Using Bridges, a well-liked and ideal complementary star, as a sweetener to attract bigger fish to Brooklyn works only if hes buying what hes selling. I doubt theyd have the juice to entice an unhappy Luka Doncic or even Donovan Mitchell, considering the Knicks rise and Clevelands recent success. For the sheer theater, it would be incredible if Trae Young played across the bridge from Madison Square Garden. Maybe Brooklynites would start going to games again, just for the treat of booing him? But the Nets have work to do to become an attractive destination again. The Dennis Smith Jr. reclamation project has been the most inspiring thing about the team this season. Maybe interim coach Kevin Ollieor Mike Budenholzer, whom they could target this summercan reinvigorate the culture.  
&gt;  
&gt;You cant help but wonder whether they would have been better off trading Bridges to the Rockets in exchange for the picks they relinquished in the James Harden deal and trading everyone else after that. Now, the Nets are positioned to overpay Nic Claxton to retain him. On the other hand, their stubborn insistence on keeping Kevin Durant as long as they did last season is why they were able to get Bridges, Johnson, and a hoard of picks for him.

My parents decided to go to the NY to make our dreams come true and visit USA and I somehow managed to make my other dream come true and I made my parents buy really expensive tickets (450+USD for 3 tickets =) for Nets vs Nuggets game on 29th of October in Brooklyn. 
It's in 2 months and I can't wait to see that game. For an european teenager from a small country, is this thing gonna be an unforgettable experience.

The seats are in sector 16 and I need to know if I'll get the chance to see the Nuggets players. So I'm asking the Nets and Nuggets fans primarily, but I don't mind if anybody else helps. :)

(questions for Nets fans) When do Nets open the arena on the game night and do visitors (Nuggets) come out of tunnel under section 16? And is there any chance i could catch ANY player for photo?

(questions for Nuggets fans) Do Nuggets players as visitors interact with fans? And if so, is it anyone specifically like Aaron Gordon or Jamal Murray? (i don't really think Jokic interacts with fans much)

And finally, last question. Westbrook signed with Nuggets and I'm even more excited for the Nuggets knowing that and I will never forget seeing him play aswell as all the other players. But it would make my whole year if he took a picture with me. So the question is. Does Brodie interact with ppl alot? Ik he is a really nice person but idk if he interacts with fan too.

That's all, I hope I'll get some nice answers.

**6.  Jason Terry.**  After having an excellent career, Terry was slowing down.  However, he had just averaged 10 ppg in Boston and helped them immensely.  After getting traded to the Nets Terry was a non-factor averaging just 4 ppg for 35 games before leaving.

**5.  Ed O'Bannon.**  After leading UCLA to the NCAA championship where O'Bannon averaged 20+ ppg and 8.3 rpg the Nets picked O'Bannon 9th in a very good NBA draft.  O'Bannon would play 2 seasons for the Nets Average about 4.5 ppg and leave the NBA the following season.

**4.  Andrei Kirlenko.**  A 'fringe' all-star for many season - most teams dreamed of having a utility player like AK on their team.  After many great seasons in Utah, AK played a season in Minnesota where he was averaging 12.4 ppg, 5.7 rpg, and 3 apg.  On the Nets, he would play 52 games with averages of 4.3 ppg, 2.9 rpg and then retire. (he was only 32)

**3.  Rony Seikley.**  After averaging 15 ppg and 8 rpg in Orlando, he gets traded mid-season to Nets for a 1st rounder, he then only plays 18 games for Nets, averages 3 ppg, 3 rpg and then retires. (he was only 33)

**2.  Dikembe Mutombo.**  The Nets traded a prime young KVH for Mutumbo for his desperately needed size.  He was averaging 11.5 ppg, 11 rpg and was an all star for Phili right before the trade.  Once on the Nets, he averaged 5.8 ppg, 6.4 rpg, and was taken out of the starter rotation often for Jason Collin.

All the Nets really had to do this season was be feisty and compete. To represent the Brooklyn grit everyone in the organization, all the way up to Sean Marks and Joe Tsai, had vouched for. 

The plan is the plan, and it was set in motion when the Nets didnt trade Mikal Bridges and Dorian Finney-Smith for a combined six first-rounders at the 2023 NBA Trade deadline.

Alright, fine. Go have a fun year, probably missing out on the playoffs  even on their best days, there is not much offensive talent on the roster  but setting yourself up in the long-term. Create buzz. As cliché as it sounds.

Ending the first half of the season by letting a rival drop a 50-bomb on you (FIFTY!) encapsulates how that effort is going. The starting point guard, whos known this organization longer than any other Net, pretty openly quit on the team. Brooklyn is now 8-23 since December 13. They are 9-26 against teams above .500.

After 17 minutes of game-time on Wednesday night, the Nets had 17 points. It never got better. When Bostons deep-bench players like Neemias Queta and Oshae Brissett werent throwing down windmills, they were hanging on the rim after dunking with both hands.

There are so many fascinating stories in the NBA this season, from these very Celtics to the drama of the Milwaukee Bucks, to the New York Knicks ascendance, to the young Oklahoma City Thunder arriving in full force. 

Maybe youre curious about the three-star experiments of the Los Angeles Clippers and Phoenix Suns, or the Denver Nuggets quest to repeat, or the Minnesota Timberwolves putting it all together. And LeBron is on the Lakers, by the way.

It would take a hefty, hefty embarrassment for national media  dying to get to the All-Star break as much as the players are  to turn their attention to Eastern Conferences 11-seed on the last day of the first half of the season. Well, the Nets produced such an embarrassment.

Its the type of loss where changes soon follow. Its the type of loss where such media will ask, What is going on in Brooklyn?

Nobody has the answers.

As a treat for their dominant start to the season, Boston held a carnival at TD Garden on Valentines Day. And the Nets were the traveling circus.",GoNets,7,https://www.reddit.com/r/GoNets/comments/1ar6vqb/brooklyn_nets_soil_themselves_in_boston_lose/

2024-01-12,1705079803,Michael Scotto and Bobby Marks talk about The Trade deadline.,"**Scotto:** The Nets have been a little too quiet. Theyre a team that I would say knows what they are right now. They are open for business and certainly taking calls. Theyve got a glut of wings, **Dorian Finney-Smith**, **Royce ONeale**. Its interesting because I feel like if they keep ONeale, you almost wonder if theyre going to try to make a run at **Donovan Mitchell** because theyre very close friends. Finney-smith is a great player on an affordable contract. Hes a guy who could fit literally on every team, but on a championship contender or high-caliber playoff team, hed be great. They would want the equivalent of two first-round picks for him, Im told.

You touched on Dinwiddie. Before the season, Dinwiddie became eligible to do an extension. From what Im told, they had brief exploratory short-term talks, whether it wouldve been a one-year or a two-year extension. Dinwiddie wanted a longer deal.

You mentioned that it seems like its the end of the road for Dinwiddie here for him in round two with the Nets. I would tend to agree. When he attacks downhill, he makes them a better team. He certainly wants to be a part of a teams core (long-term). We did [**a podcast earlier in the year,**](https://hoopshype.com/lists/nets-spencer-dinwiddie-ben-simmons-cam-thomas-cam-johnson-kevin-durant-james-harden-free-agency/) and he made it clear that if he left, hed leave the team in better hands, and hed still be a Nets fan. It sounded like a guy who knew that, eventually, hed probably be gone. When he talks about the core, he mentions everybody else and not himself.

As for **Ben Simmons**, you cant count on him at all. I know all summer he was hyped up like **Don King** that hes going to come back. Physically, he hasnt been able to do it. When you talk of him as a former three-time All-Star, the keyword is former. You cant view him like that right now because he cant get on the court.

**Marks:** If Simmons was a free agent this offseason, hed get the minimum because hes not reliable. Thats just the reality of it. What team out there, unless youre going to sign him and put an injury protection clause in there that protects every part of his body, what team would go out there? I thought he was pretty good in the games he played this year, but since 2020-21, he hasnt played.

**Scotto:** Hes rebounded and passed the ball well. Hes been an above-average defender, not the All-Defensive Team player on defense. I saw the games. He didnt drive to the rim in the half court. He doesnt want to go to the foul line. You cant have that at 6-foot-10. I dont know if its a confidence thing or what it is, but when thats not happening, thats a problem.

The Nets also have to pay **Nic Claxton**. Theyre making it seem like theyre preparing to pay him. Claxton told me [**he wants to re-sign in Brooklyn**](https://hoopshype.com/lists/nic-claxton-hopes-to-re-sign-with-brooklyn-i-love-it-here/) when we did our interview. I have him somewhere in the $20-25 million range.

**Marks:** Hes probably at what Poeltl got somewhere around four years, $80 million with Toronto. I like Claxton better than Poeltl. Theyre just in a weird spot because Houston controls their draft picks for the next four years. Normally, youd want to have your own pick, tear it down, build around Bridges, and go from there, but theres no incentive to do that. On the other end, you do have all these expiring contracts and we talked about Dinwiddie, so whos your point guard next year?

**Scotto:** Ive got one more for you, Bobby, because hes a hot topic, **Cam Thomas**. Hes one of the most polarizing players in the league. Before he got moved to the bench, he was the leading scorer for the Nets. Hes improved. Hes gotten to the rim more and drawn fouls. His shot selection improved, even though I wont say its always the best. What are your thoughts on him and potential plans for him with the Nets?

**Marks:** I think hes gotten better and gets to the free throw line a lot more than he did a year ago, and I think thats a sign of a guy whos not just relying on jumpers. You hear hes an empty stats guy that can put up 29 points and youll lose consistently. Thomas for me is a sixth man right now, and could be a high-level sixth man. **Jordan Clarkson** was a sixth man for a long time and is really good. I think its going to be interesting. Hes extension-eligible this offseason because hell be going into year four. What do you do with him? I understand the fan base in Brooklyn because the fan base has prioritized him and hes like one of their own children. When you get drafted by that organization and you develop with moments of really good play, its like hes one of theirs and so is Claxton. Is Thomas fine with being a sixth man?

**Scotto:** Other guys around the league will tell me on a championship-caliber team, which is what every team aspires to be one day, Thomas could be a **Lou Williams** or **Jamal Crawford** type of guy.",GoNets,69,https://www.reddit.com/r/GoNets/comments/1950apb/michael_scotto_and_bobby_marks_talk_about_the/
2024-01-10,1704920051,"[Stein] According to rival NBA executives, the New York Knicks and Brooklyn Nets are not the teams to watch in the event of a Donovan Mitchell. That team is the Miami Heat due to their defensive infrastructure with Adebayo, Butler, and Spoelstra to ""get the most out of Mitchell.""","
Source: https://marcstein.substack.com/p/the-latest-on-donovan-mitchell-and

&gt; The Knicks and Brooklyn Nets will also always continue to be mentioned as potential Mitchell suitors, but multiple executives from rival front offices have mentioned to me in recent weeks that they regard the Heat as a prime team to watch for Mitchell fit-wise because, as one veteran personnel man put it, Miami has the defensive infrastructure to get the most out of Mitchell with Jimmy Butler and Bam Adebayo as its star duo and Erik Spoelstra (who just signed an eight-year, $120 million contract extension) as coach.

&gt; The Knicks are 5-0 since acquiring OG Anunoby from Toronto on Dec. 30. They are clicking with their new swingman, who appears to be such a strong fit with his own considerable 3-and-D capabilities that it enables New York (if it so chooses) to remain patient in pursuit of the star so many around the league expect them to eventually acquire. The Knicks recently released longtime Tom Thibodeau favorite Taj Gibson to open an addition roster spot, which naturally sparks belief that another trade is coming soon after Anunobys arrival, but New York could simply elect to focus on fortifying its depth with smaller moves in the short term before making a play for a headliner in the offseason.",GoNets,34,https://www.reddit.com/r/GoNets/comments/193ivhv/stein_according_to_rival_nba_executives_the_new/

2024-09-13,1726237314,Let the freak Flagg fly over Brooklyn,"This is an excellent video by the always superb J. Kyle Mann (seek out his other video breakdowns).

Discussed in the vid is the range of skills that Cooper Flagg possesses and that he pushes to always be better, taking the challenge of an increase in competition which is what you want to see from the very best type of players.

There doesn't seem to be the need for CF to be a number one scorer given his all-around game yet his scoring ability and potential has significantly increased recently. 

One player comparison I hadn't considered before is Shawn Marrion, the AK47 comparison is on point as many have said and there's no point in comparing Flagg to anyone better such as all-time top 30 greats when Flagg is still only 17 and hasn't even played college ball yet.

Yet adding Cooper to the Nets in 2025 would be transformational for this franchise.

2024-01-03,1704290526,Let Claxton Shoot,"Were one month away from the trade deadline and a few months away from the end of Claxtons final year of his contract. Its time to see if Claxton can shoot. We need to know if he can slide up to the PF position.

Over the last month, weve seen him put up a few shots. Some out of desperation, one a designed play, and last night in the flow of the game. The stroke looks good, theyve been all swishes, no bouncing around lucky shots. His FT shooting is also improving, which could be a sign his small sample size shooting is not a fluke. 

I dont think we can pay a center with the physical limitations Claxton has. The league is getting too big, theres too many players you know are going to dominate Claxton.

If Claxton can shoot, its clear he can slide up to the PF position and let him do what he does best, defend the perimeter and off-ball shot blocking. Yet here we are, over two months into the season and boxing in Claxton into a traditional center role on a team that needs more offense.

Let the man shoot, lets find out if he can be our PF of the future. If he cant shoot, theres tough decisions to be made. I wouldnt trade him unless we got some serious value back. I also would be scared to pay him big money or watch him walk.

I think the Clowney pick is very interesting. He has the same physical limitations as Claxton, but we know he can shoot. Additionally, hes a solid rebounder and shot blocker. Does Marks see him as our future PF or Claxtons replacement at center?",GoNets,36,https://www.reddit.com/r/GoNets/comments/18xk3k3/let_claxton_shoot/
2024-01-01,1704146596,Trade thoughts for rest of season &amp; beyond,"**Don't trade- keep as long as possible:**

Nic Claxton- We have his bird rights, and even if you're disappointed with his growth, we can keep the 2nd best switching big in the NBA for cheap. He's 24. No brainer.

Day'Ron Sharpe- Rookie contract till 2025. Crazy good development curve at 22. Covers all of Clax's relative weakspots (body size, offensive rebounding) minus shooting. Super high-quality, homegrown big rotation we can keep indefinitely without breaking the bank.

Cam Thomas- Streaky, incomplete, and frustrating, but at 22 has shown flashes of All-NBA scoring talent. It is zero risk to feed him minutes on a team without its own picks. Even if it's rocky, PT could keep him happy and compel him to accept a 2-year ""prove-it"" style extension like Clax did. 

Ben Simmons- Every draft pick we have is invaluable post-Harden trade. Attaching capital to offload Ben makes no sense. We let him walk and get a max amount of room in 2025. Who knows what the landscape looks like then: worth having flexibility in the off-chance someone like Tatum or LeBron wants to swing by. 

**Trade tomorrow**

Spencer Dinwiddie- Expiring, and most importantly, sucks up touches. We are undoubtedly a better team with him on the floor atm, but that speaks more to our lack of ballhandlers and playmakers than Spencer's value. Most importantly, we don't want to lose him for 0. Worst case, we get back only draft capital, leaving CT, DSJ, and Watford in bigger playmaking roles, sink or swim. Plenty of contending teams would love to use Spencer how he's better employed- an off-ball, secondary playmaker next to a legit ball dominant guy. Dallas would love him back, and he'd look great in Denver, just to name a couple. 

Royce O'Neal- One of my all time-favorite Nets from an energy POV alone, but he's expiring, and we're not in a place where it makes very much sense to re-sign a 30 year old 3nD wing on a team full of 3nD wings playing bad D. Royce's market for contending teams will be big, and a first round pick is hard to turn down. 

**Available for the right price**

DFS (probably most available given his age, but also our most efficient shooter and best defender by a lot this year), Cam Johnson, and Mikal are all on *amazingly* team friendly contracts. Worst case, they stick around, keep us a floating around .500 team, and help build a positive culture for young players to grow. Best case, a desperate contender is willing to give up a lot for him to aid in a soft rebuild. 

It's not difficult to imagine a team like Dallas, Philly, Atlanta, or Miami getting desperate after a bad stretch or another disappointing season, forcing them into an overpay for a guy like Mikal or Dorian to keep their superstar happy. It makes sense to hold these 3 in the case we get lucky draft/free agent wise, or someone gives up the farm.

**Play the rookies**. Jalen Wilson looks awesome in the G league and in limited minutes. With so little on the line this year, giving him, Clowney, and Whitehead even back of the rotation looks on a consistent basis is important.",GoNets,112,https://www.reddit.com/r/GoNets/comments/18w83sm/trade_thoughts_for_rest_of_season_beyond/

With all of that said: whats the best option for him? We can keep him and remove that amount off of our books, trade him for picks or young players if a team wants that amount off of their books. I doubt hell return to playing 79 + games he did his 1st two seasons in the league.

2024-02-14,1707879906,"If any loss is a ""good loss"" this might be one","The Celtics are legit contenders and regardless you can't play from behind all game against anyone it's so much more difficult to win. But I think there were some good signs. 

JV experimented with different lineups and that's always a good thing to see- the willingness to change. I hope the last few games kills the ""the Nets are holding back cam Thomas"" stupidity because he's played awfully and JV leaves him out there. TONIGHT it worked and he started hitting shots. Jalen Wilson getting minutes in the 4th. It's called player development. 

Say what you want about Ben Simmons the game is different when he's simply out on the court regardless of statistical impact. I also love how he jaws at dudes every night. Why do we think he's soft again? Cause he didn't bounce back from freaking micro discotomy surgery and doc rivers and Joel Embiid said he wasn't? I think they lied to us. 

There's a different air about this team now. Even three weeks ago there's no chance this team battles back. They for sure roll over and get the doors blown off of them. I don't know if 1/2 a week of Schroeder is it or if it's just the fact that the deadline is over and this roster is what it is. Maybe dinwiddie was truly poison? But they compete and play hard and play for each other. It's refreshing.

2024-01-01,1704076828,CT coming of the bench is not a good solution,"The lineup of Bridges, Spencer, Clax, Johnson and Smith has been proven to not be as effective as we thought, and that is shown by JV's decision to play the fourth quarter with the lineup of CT, Bridges, Spencer, Johnson and Clax. 

I think we are targetting the wrong guy. By taking CT out of the starting 5, we lose half of our capability to create scoring chances. Him and Bridges are the only ones who can do it with the absence of Lonnie Walker. They need to both start the game together, and we can't be without at least one of them on the court at any time.

My opinion is: either move Cam Johnson to the bench  and let the boy run absolutely wild, or move Dinwiddie to the bench and make Bridges the point guard.

Dinwiddie has already shown to not be reliable, and Johnson has shown that he is too good to just be a screen setter and spot up shooter. I would prefer the first option. I think a scenario where Johnson is the second option on the floor and not the fourth one is just what the man needs to flourish, while keeping our defensive power on the starting five still good and augmenting our offensive power like crazy. I can see CJ's talent, and wasting it on makinh him be a spot up shooter is just not it. It also would help with the bench's defense, which right now is horrendous.

2023-10-28,1698474567,State of the Brooklyn Nets,"Okay so the Brooklyn nets 2023-24 roster has a ton on potential. Here is my take on the state of the nets and what should be occurring moving forward. I love this organization and want nothing but the best for my Brooklyn Nets. It may seem negative at points, but I am sharing my thoughts and letting frustration flow.

Point one:

Ben Simmons is a great player, he can guard 1-5 and should be a 12/10/10 player every season for the rest of his career. He is your best ball handler and MUST be on the court at the end of games. It has been too long that spencer Dinwiddie handles the ball at the end of a game, where we run a set to get the ball to bridges at the three point line. Let Ben play the entirety of the last 4 minutes, let him control the ball, the tempo and run the offense. Dont put Dinwiddie in a spot to be the primary ballhadler after all game having him play off ball. BEN SIMMONS IS A TOP 5 POINT GAURD AND NEEDS TO BE TREATED ACCORDINGLY, TRUST HIM AT THE END OF GAMES AND GIVE HIM THE KEYS TO THE TEAM.

Point two:

Cam Thomas is an all star. He is the best player on the roster. He is 22 years old. Pay him his money immediately. If you can not teach him to play an ounce of defense in the next 2 years then the coaching staff needs to be sent to mars. The man is a walking bucket and the team needs to be built around him. He is a superstar and there is no doubt about it. You cannot guard him, he is too elusive and tricky with drawing fouls. Tonight was the night against the mavericks that he showed he can play within the offense as well as play good defense. I watched him tonight guard Kyrie and doncic better than 90% of our team. I watched him make passes I havent seen out of him and he deserves that starting spot. I WILL MAKE A DECLERATION RIGHT NOW, IF WE DO NOT GIVE HIM HIS MONEY AND RESIGN HIM I WILL OFFICALLY SAY WE LET HIM DOWN.

Point 3:

Enough with the bridges superstar talk. He is an excellent player but never will be a superstar. When we got him from phoenix he was a top 5 defensive player with an offensive game still in the works. Since he came here he has forgotten about defense and switched gears to being an offensive superstar. We need to stop pushing him into the role of the closer and push him into the role of being the robin to cam Thomas Batman. He needs to focus in on his defense and get back to his roots. The more we push him to be something he isnt the more we will be hurting him and our team. BRIDGES IS NOT A SUPERSTAR, HE IS AN EXCELLENT PLAYER BUT NEEDS TO HONE IN ON WHAT HE IS BEST AT. 

Point 4 and final:

Build this basketball team around ben Simmons and cam Thomas. Bridges, cam Johnson, finney and Claxton are all great pieces but dont be fooled. The core of this team lies with a backcourt of Simmons and Thomas.

Cs built their team around two all-NBA guys who played in the Finals well before their super maxs kicked in. Now that both those guys are finally getting paid, their tax bill this season will be greater than all the tax the Clips or the Warriors have ever paid&ever. And the only reason they are even in a position to do that is because they were able to wait and pay the best guy last. 

TWolves still have Ant on a rookie max. Ditto Luka and the Mavs and Shea in OKC. Jokics supermax only kicked in last year.  

Knicks lucked out with Jalen Brunson. Cs had a similar situation a while back with Isaiah Thomas. But unless youre hoping to uncover the next franchise guy who makes 6th man money, all the asset accumulation, draft pick hoarding, and savvy trades in the world will only get you so far if you dont draft a top 10 guy and build around him while hes still on a rookie contract.

&gt; Since the Brooklyn Nets rested a number of their players in a 144-122 loss at home to the Milwaukee Bucks on December 27th, they have posted a 1-8 record. The Nets are one game out of the play-in behind the Atlanta Hawks, but many around the NBA expect them to continue to compete for a shot at the postseason.

&gt; ""I can't speak to what the Nets are thinking at this very second, but the word through the NBA is the Nets are attempting to be buyers,"" said Brian Windhorst on Friday's episode of The Hoop Collective.

&gt; The podcast conversation was centered on whether the Nets should look to pick up some future draft capital for a player like Dorian Finney-Smith, who holds value around the league.

&gt; The Nets do not control their first round pick this season as it will be sent to the Houston Rockets as part of the 2021 James Harden trade, which disincentivizes them from taking a step back.

2024-01-05,1704483498,Top 5 Nets Memories,"This sub has been toxic lately, the vibes are bad and were like passengers stranded on an island after a plane crash. Works been slow, kids in daycare, so I wanted to do a positive Nets related exercise for myself as theyve been a big part of my life and now sharing it with you.

Hope we all can take a step back and realize, this is only a moment in Nets history and no matter how grim it looks now, it will get better, unless they move us away from the area. **Also fuck the Knicks.**


Would love to hear about what your favorite memories are of your time as a Nets fan. Here are mine in order from when it happened:

1. **Any alley-oop from Jason Kidd to Kenyon Martin.** There is no other play I would use to exemplify what the early 2000s Nets were. In an era of isolation and slow play, they were a fast break energy team, led by the dynamic duo of Kidd and Kenyon. Their signature off the backboard alley oop would send the crowd into the frenzy and send a spark into the rest of the team. Felt like one of the 3rd quarter Warrior runs where everyone suddenly became in-sync. Kidd was the conductor of the whole team, but Kenyon was the heart and soul.

Heres some alley oops: https://youtu.be/D3xoDBiEHeY?si=sbAteppLm1uG-_nG



2. **Game 5 of the first round of the 2002 NBA Playoffs against the Pacers.** Its win or go home, the Nets are up 3 with 5 seconds left, Nets rookie Richard Jefferson steps to the line. He has a chance to send the #1 seeded Nets to the second round, something that hasnt happened since the 1983-1984 season. He chokes and misses both, the ball gets into his Reggies hands and he banks it in after the buzzer from near half court. The refs count it, theres no in-game replays, the game is going into overtime. The kid in front of me is having a full on meltdown calling for Richard Jefferson to be banned from the state of New Jersey. That might have been the loudest the Continental Airlines Arena ever got. Thankfully, the Nets went on to win in double overtime and make it all the way to the NBA finals.

The play: https://youtu.be/WBhC1gMTsc8?si=e6bqAJz0HYZI3dRS



3. **The last game the Nets played in New Jersey.** The days of Jason Kidd were long gone. You think vibes now are bad? The team not only sucked, but for 2 years we knew this team was being taken away from us. The attendance was consistently bottom 3 in the league and the ticket prices were cheaper than a burger off the McDonalds dollar menu. The Nets had moved from the Izod Center to Prudential in Newark, a stadium built for a hockey team. I can remember the atmosphere that night, it was the epitome of Chris Christies remarks to them leaving good riddance.

I certainly have more fond memories of the Nets, but this was the last Nets game I went to with my dad. Hes still alive so its not a sad story, but he refuses to make the trek out to Brooklyn. I was fortunate enough to be able to go to countless games with him growing up. Its the reason I love the sport of basketball, the reason I love the Nets and always will.

TV Segment of the Final Game: https://youtu.be/_uRe08Gp6NQ?si=uCXFGfoJJZdp1yu6


4. **Kyrie's first game as a Net.** However you feel about the man and how he destroyed this franchise's championship dream, he was in the words of Stephen A Smith, box office. It was a pleasure watching his game on a night to night basis and there was no better night for me than his first game. There was debate amongst Nets fans if we should replace DLo with Kyrie and in one night it became apparent we made the right decision.

Kyrie goes off for 50 points, the Barclays was rocking as hes making ridiculous 3s, crossovers, and layups. We entered a new era of Nets basketball, and it was going to be a great (as far as we knew). Wanted so badly for that game winner to go in, even so, it was a magical night of Nets basketball. It was one of those games Ill never forget where I was watching it.

Here's the game: https://youtu.be/B1r6tgpxEwk?si=c37nDydk9RrrJIIj



5. **I got to see the Big 3 in person only one time.** Game 2 of the first round of the 2021 NBA Playoffs against the Celtics. The ball was popping, everyone was in sync, I was witnessing one of the greatest NBA teams in history playing at peak performance. The irony is, the best player in that game was Smoking Joe Harris. He single handily started the blowout with 16 in the first half. Finished with 25 pts and 7 3 pointers. Kinda wish they didnt blow them out so I couldve seen more of the Big 3, I remember telling my wife at least we can see them next season&

It made it special that Joe was the one leading this Big 3. He was the only guy left from the rebuild after we lost Dinwiddie (to injury), Levert, Jarrett, and DLo. Felt like a proud father watching his son not only play with the big boys but be the stand out.

2024-10-15,1729003981,Some Thoughts on Ben Simmons,"Lifelong Sixers fan who recently moved to NYC, and has started going to Nets games with my hardcore Nets fan friend.  

  
Went to see Nets / Wizards last night and I have some thoughts on Ben, as someone who saw his first game on an NBA Court in person and dozens since.

  
1) He changed his shot AGAIN!  He has this awful like, twist-hitch in his left hand now when he shoots.  Not only is it ugly, it doesn't seem to be working, and it slows down his release.  Really disappointing, was hoping he would have had time to work on that.

  
2) Good news!  He did seem aggressive getting into the paint in the start of the game.  One thing about Ben is that he's always been a graceful guy to watch move, and with his aggression and size he was getting to the basket and converting some of those tough floaters / lay-ups he was so good at in his prime.

  
3) Never stopped being good on D.  My God is he dangerous on that end.

  
4) Last thing, but towards the end of the first he fell back into his second worst habit again (the worst being his fear of contact at the rim), passing the ball too early.  Ben has always been a willing passer, which is good, but it's most effective when he can get towards the paint to draw people in before he passes out.  Towards the end of the first / the rest of the game he fell back into passing above the three point line before the defense has had to rotate, which leaves whoever he throws it to stranded, and considering the Nets aren't exactly loaded with dribble creators this could be baaad.

  
That's all!  Just wanted to share as a Simmons guy.",GoNets,49,https://www.reddit.com/r/GoNets/comments/1g49kvr/some_thoughts_on_ben_simmons/

&gt;So, what could be the next big swing on the Jazzs radar? [Brooklyn Nets](https://sports.yahoo.com/nba/teams/brooklyn/) swingman [Mikal Bridges](https://sports.yahoo.com/nba/players/6021/), according to league sources, is a player to monitor among Utahs most aggressive aspirations. The Jazz are said to be right in the mix with [Houston](https://sports.yahoo.com/nba/teams/houston/), holding the No. 3 pick, and New York, where three of Bridges college teammates currently play, among the teams that continue to check with Brooklyn about the availability of its 27-year-old swingman. The Jazz have substantial salaries for veterans [John Collins](https://sports.yahoo.com/nba/players/5832/) ($26.5 million) and [Jordan Clarkson](https://sports.yahoo.com/nba/players/5357/) ($14 million) to send out in any possible deal, in addition to trading into their own cap room.

&gt;Teams picking behind Houston maintain the team is motivated to move its No. 3 selection for win-now upgrades, as the team is expected to pick up the team option for JaeSean Tate and guarantee the salaries of [Jeff Green](https://sports.yahoo.com/nba/players/4247/) and [Jock Landale](https://sports.yahoo.com/nba/players/6614/), sources said, as potential outgoing money in trade packages.





&gt;  
The Nets have been active in attempts to try to trade into this weeks draft, according to league sources, as Brooklyn does not currently own a selection. The Nets have called front offices with selections as early as the 20s, sources said, as many teams appear to be open for business to move out of the first entirely, down a flew slots or into the second round.

&gt;Phoenix at No. 22, New York at No. 25, [Minnesota](https://sports.yahoo.com/nba/teams/minnesota/) at No. 27, Utah at No. 29, and [Boston](https://sports.yahoo.com/nba/teams/boston/) with No. 30 are weighing various trade scenarios, sources said, in both directions along the draft board.

2024-05-03,1714755721,Next Step for Cam Thomas: Being A Point Guard,"I think we're all pretty happy with Cam's development this season. I'm not gonna do a stat rundown, but he made a huge increase in minutes per game and points per game. 

But we always knew scoring was a piece of cake for him. It's the other stuff that he's improved on that's impressed me. His facilitating and court vision has definitely taken a step up, along with his rebounding. Defense is still a work in progress, but I'm not expecting much from him on that end.

Regardless, next season, I think he should  become a full-time starting point guard for us. He's not gonna grow in the assists column if he's not given the chance to, and letting him run the show would be how he would get there. 

Also, hiding him on defense as a PG is much easier than hiding him on defense as a SG. Not to mention, Schroder could ease into a 6th man role and be our bench leader. And by shifting Cam as the 1, the other starting positions would be bigger by default (ie Mikal is a 2, instead of a 3).

Now I'm not saying he's gonna turn into Harden, but that's the direction I want him to take. A shooting guard who eventually becomes a point guard. I think that's the best direction for him. 

Only way I'd be against this is if we trade for a clearly better option at the 1 spot this offseason.

2024-01-06,1704510555,How Real is Cam Thomas?,"Cam made Zach Lowe's top 10 list this week.  Good analysis.  Paywall so here are the highlights:

 

In 2020-21, [Collin Sexton](https://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/4277811/collin-sexton) averaged 24 points for the [Cleveland Cavaliers](https://www.espn.com/nba/team/_/name/cle/cleveland-cavaliers) on solid shooting, and few thought much of it. Scoring was up; 24 points wasn't what it used to be. Sexton was too small to play on the wing and did not have the vision of a point guard. The entire league pretty much shrugged at those 24 points and concluded, ""Eh, he's probably a sixth man.""

Sexton is starting now on a [Utah Jazz](https://www.espn.com/nba/team/_/name/utah/utah-jazz) team that is 9-3 in its past 12 games, but he has indeed mostly been a sixth man since that season -- [a throw-in](https://www.espn.com/nba/story/_/id/34502825/sources-cleveland-cavaliers-trade-3-first-round-picks-two-swaps-utah-jazz-star-donovan-mitchell) to the [Donovan Mitchell](https://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/3908809/donovan-mitchell) trade.

[Brooklyn Nets](https://www.espn.com/nba/team/_/name/bkn/brooklyn-nets) coach Jacque Vaughn decided last week that [Cam Thomas](https://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/4432174/cam-thomas)' team-leading 22.4 points no longer merited a starting role. Opponents have destroyed the Nets by 9.2 points per 100 possessions with Thomas on the floor -- worst among Brooklyn regulars. The team broadcast caught [Nic Claxton](https://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/4278067/nic-claxton) shouting at Thomas to pass the ball during one recent game.

Thomas is jacking 22.2 shots per 36 minutes; only Luka Doncic and [Joel Embiid](https://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/3059318/joel-embiid) (about 23 each) average more. Twelve of the 13 players attempting 20-plus shots per 36 minutes dish at least 4.3 assists per game. Thomas averages 2.3. He is on pace to be the first player since Carmelo Anthony in 2012-13 -- and only the second since 1994 -- to attempt at least 21 shots per 36 minutes and record fewer than three dimes, according to Basketball-Reference.

Some of the passes Thomas makes are a beat late -- last resorts, tossed only once Thomas concludes he can't find a shot. The defense is ready.

Thomas is taller, longer and bulkier than Sexton; he should be able to contribute more on defense. He has some good on-ball reps and a nose for steals, but Thomas' off-ball defense is a train wreck.

He is an addicted ball watcher and loses touch with shooters.

Thomas fulfills his first responsibility by crashing inside as a help defender. But he lingers too long, ends up in no-man's land and stares at the ball even as it is halfway back to his man. 

 

If [Isaiah Hartenstein](https://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/4222252/isaiah-hartenstein) makes a tough hook there, you tip your cap. Swarming Hartenstein from the near corner is maybe the worst possible decision. Thomas does not box out or get rebounds, either.

And yet, there is a player in here somewhere who could log real minutes -- yes, probably as a bench scorer -- for a good team. Thomas is a legitimately outrageous shot-maker from every level whose percentages would go up if he bagged two or three of his most audacious attempts. He has the size and handle to get to the line a fair amount.

How long will it take for Thomas to find the right balance? How many teams will he have cycled through?

The Nets loom as a trade deadline wild card. They are 3-11 in their past 14 games, at risk of falling below the play-in. They're mediocre, stylistically vanilla -- without much variety or physicality.

They have two veteran wings -- [Royce O'Neale](https://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/2583632/royce-oneale) and [Dorian Finney-Smith](https://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/2578185/dorian-finney-smith) \-- contenders might covet, and they could trade one or both without handicapping their current team much. (They owe their first-round pick to the [Houston Rockets](https://www.espn.com/nba/team/_/name/hou/houston-rockets) \-- thanks, [James Harden](https://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/3992/james-harden)! -- so they have no incentive to tank.)

They also own a bundle of extra picks from other teams -- ammunition with which to deal. They could trade in both directions.

2024-04-17,1713356906,Can Nets Land Trae Young in the Summer?,"&gt; The Brooklyn Nets have a ton of wings and a solid big man in Nic Claxton (an unrestricted free agent) but need help at point guard. The team traded Spencer Dinwiddie's expiring contract to the Raptors (who let him go soon after) in return for Dennis Schroder, but NBA scouts generally view him as a backup.

&gt; Brooklyn can't quite compete with the Spurs regarding draft pick volume, but the Nets have more to offer than the Lakers. While the team still owes multiple first-round picks to the Houston Rockets from the James Harden trade, the Nets restocked their coffers by sending Harden to the Philadelphia 76ers, Kevin Durant to the Phoenix Suns and Kyrie Irving to the Dallas Mavericks. They now project to have two first-rounders in 2025, two in 2027, three in 2029 and one apiece in 2028 (TBD by protections), 2030 and 2031. Brooklyn also projects to have 10 second-rounders through 2031.

&gt; Assuming Claxton re-signs and wings Mikal Bridges and Cameron Johnson are keepers, the Nets have a significant expiring contract to send for Young with Ben Simmons ($40.3 million). Others could include Dorian Finney-Smith ($14.9 million), Cam Thomas ($4 million), Day'Ron Sharpe ($4 million), Noah Clowney ($3.2 million), Dariq Whitehead ($3.1 million) and Schroder ($13 million). Keita Bates-Diop ($2.7 million player option) and Jalen Wilson ($1.9 million, $75,000 guaranteed) are on minimum contracts.

&gt; The Nets also have several large trade exceptions ($20.4 million for Dinwiddie, $11.9 million for Joe Harris, $9.5 million for Royce O'Neale and $6.8 million for Patty Mills). None would help Young directly, but it could come into play in a multi-team trade and/or if the Hawks want to send out other players.

2024-02-16,1708101251,Regarding fans at the Barclays&,"Like others, I was definitely bummed out listening to that podcast Mikal was on.

I know its been sounding and feeling bad being at the games hearing fans from other teams drown us out. But even before KD and Kyrie there was a really good atmosphere that proves a good product and a hard working team gives Nets fans the right energy and reasons to show up.

Been a fan since 01 as a kid in Jersey, but eventually moved to NYC as many do around here. I first joined the BK Block in 2018-2019, and the first 20 or so games were miserable. We were basically on a 10 game losing streak at one point and we had to shout over fans from every other team every night. Somehow even Jazz fans outnumbered us one night which was insane. But then the magic of that year started brewing after that players-only meeting. All of a sudden DLo and Caris started playing at an all-star level. Jarret Allen was becoming a force. Rondae and Theo started busting moves on the bench. Game by game you saw more and more Nets fans come back. The whole team was fun to watch and always hustled and grinded, even though many nights we were outmatched on talent.

I vividly remember a game against the  Blake Griffin-led Pistons, and if we won it we clinched a playoff seed. Ive never heard the place so loud that entire season. The whole arena was on their feet for the last possession of the first half because we were absolutely killing them. 

All the way until the playoffs, we had that same energy in the arena. It was amazing. Even that home game 3 vs Philly in the first round was insane. 

The Knicks have definitely gone through periods where it was just as  miserable to go to games as a fan, although a lot less painful than us in BK considering how many fans they have/how long the team has been there. Their fans can deny that all they want, but my dad is a Knick fan and we would go to games when they sucked, and there were several times fans of other teams drowned out the  Knick fans. Now, they (NYK) have a lot of parallels to the 18-19 Nets, just a better version. 

Sadly, I cant go to as many games since Ive moved a bit further away :( But well get back there soon. Just need guys who will go out there and give it their all, and a coach that continually inspires and demands that out of them. 

Oh, and winning a bit helps too.",GoNets,50,https://www.reddit.com/r/GoNets/comments/1ascxgd/regarding_fans_at_the_barclays/

2024-01-04,1704373221,The contrarian nature of Jacque Vaughn is losing Brooklyn Nets a lot of games.,"**There is no denying the Nets are struggling. We might not have premier talent on the roster but we have depth and quality NBA rotation players yet many if not all of them are playing very poorly at the moment. Its bizarre in the extreme that so many of the players are performing poorly at the same time.** 

**Perhaps mood is low within the team as constant losing saps the fun out of competing. But these are proud professionals and this roster doesnt have divas as in the past.** 

**Many people want a change in head coach - me included - as they hold Jacque Vaughn responsible for the losses and many in-game head scratching decisions which have seen momentum shift to the opposition. Winnable games have been lost this season because of coaching decisions. Substitutions have left us puzzled, the grit and tenacity we used to see in the players has disappeared.** 

**Five man rotations we know dont pass the eye test and are shown by data to be ineffective are continued with by the head coach.** 

**It really seems to me that Jacque Vaughn is a contrarian and goes against what is popular and obvious. Is it an arrogance or is it further proof that JV isnt suited to a head coaching position. A coach can have a great career as an excellent assistant and advisor to the head coach. That premier role doesnt suit everybody.**

**It seems obvious to most of us fans that we have defensive personnel that would excel in switching everything. At training camp Jacque Vaughn implements a heavy drop coverage system on defence. Many fans thought this was unusual at the time but we trust our head coach to find the style of play that makes the team the most competitive it can be.** 

**The drop defence has been a disaster for this team. Is Jacque Vaughn too proud to admit he got it terribly wrong from the start of the season and wont go back to a style where the players are more effective? The Nets are a much better rebounding team but one would expect that being closer to the rim.** 

**The Nets players sag off who theyre defending to such an extent that players and teams not associated with success in the NBA are having career nights against us shooting from 3pt land. This is happening over and over again this season and will continue given how important the 3 point shot has become in the NBA.** 

**This has been an issue all season. Allowing a bad team like the Charlotte Hornets to come into Brooklyn and shoot a scorching 58.3% from 3 is terrible. When you dont challenge a team and allow them space you give them confidence. The Hornets beat us in our own building on a night they shot 50.5%/58.3%/100% - looking at that efficiency alone youd think the Hornets could be a NBA Finals team but no theyre bottom four in the league. Another user** [**u/JurgenFlippers**](https://www.reddit.com/user/JurgenFlippers/) **has a post today which points out the teams struggles in recent games against opposition 3 point %. Go check it out:** [**https://www.reddit.com/r/GoNets/comments/18y37n9/the\_booklyn\_nets\_and\_opponent\_3s/**](https://www.reddit.com/r/GoNets/comments/18y37n9/the_booklyn_nets_and_opponent_3s/)

**Nic Claxton has not continued to improve after a really impressive season last year and this is a contract year for him. The time when pro athletes tend to play hardest to get the highest possible salary for the next few year years. Claxton is not being put in a position to succeed. Hes an incredible perimeter defender who can block shots, hes not an outstanding natural rebounder.** 

**Claxton is only one example but the same could be said for Mikal Bridges, Cam J, DFS, Royce who could all excel on switching.** 

**As a fan base we were excited by this group of players and while we were under no illusion of a deep-play-off run we knew those players would play hard and compete because theyre very good defenders. At the moment there is complete disinterest among the players and Mikal who is meant to be the leader of this group and was the runner up of a previous DPOY award rarely even looks like a mediocre defender.** 

**Now Mikal may have just hit the wall given the games played and minutes played over the previous half decade plus the long summer stint with team USA but it seems something more.** 

**Mikal was vocally upset about not being able to play more against the Bucks. That was a coaching decision. For such an on-brand player to publicly show disgruntlement at a coaching decision tells us all is not well within the locker room.** 

**Cam Thomas is a divisive figure among the fan base, hell be a great player soon and is already an elite scorer but the frequent changing of role for him must mess with his game. It would mess with any players game. I fully support the need for Cam to be a better all round player but Cam is not a PG, hes a scorer who needs to be able to create for others. To ask him to be the lead ball-handler is to give him a responsibility hes not trained for while also asking him to still shoulder the responsibility to be the teams most reliable scorer.**  

**In the corporate world you dont ask a lawyer to become head of marketing. Theyre different skills from what the employee trained/studied for.**

**Several times this season when Cam has been scoring efficiently and racking up points Ive seen Jacque Vaughn sit Cam down and not just for a few minutes to catch his breath. Any hot-hand Cam had is totally cooled down by JV as he sits Cam for an extended amount of time. One poster wrote in a recent game Cam sat for 40 real-time minutes between checking out of the game before being subbed back in. He was hot when he went to the bench. How can a player expect to be able to continue scoring efficiently when hes lost all momentum. Its like JV just hits Cams breaks. Contrarian behaviour by JV.**

**Last year Jacque Vaughn basically benched Cam for the rest of the season after the trade deadline and straight after Cams three successive 40+ games. There were a few minutes here and there but nothing extended and numerous DNP-CDs. Why? We dont know but it was probably because JV wanted Cam to commit to passing more and playing better defence.** 

**When Cam did get extended minutes again in the regular season finale against Philly Cam poured in 46 points (on 55/75/100) which made people ask why he hadnt been playing.** 

**I wrote about this here - Fixing the narrative: Cam Thomas elite efficiency in his 40+ point games.**

[https://www.reddit.com/r/GoNets/comments/178m7uv/fixing\_the\_narrative\_cam\_thomas\_elite\_efficiency/](https://www.reddit.com/r/GoNets/comments/178m7uv/fixing_the_narrative_cam_thomas_elite_efficiency/)

**The Nets really struggled to score in the play-offs but Cam T got very few minutes and DNP-CDs. It is this contrarian stubbornness by our head coach which really seems to be holding the team back.** 

**Also Id like to make the point that the Nets were not a good team last season after the trade deadline. Brooklyn fell backwards into the play-offs because every team around us was tanking for a better chance of winning the Wemby lottery and Kyrie and KD had built a cushion of wins for the team to get to the post-season. The Nets were easily the worst of the 16 teams who competed in the play-offs last season. They couldnt even steal a game when the 76ers rested Embiid.** 

**This roster has now been together for 11 months. That is more than enough time to realise changes are necessary find a lead ball handler, find a power forward who can rebound next to Nic Claxton. Playing a tall guard like Cam Johnson at PF is not gonna cut it because it gives you the most frail front court in the league.**

**Jacque Vaughn seems like a decent guy but it does appear hes losing the locker room. Will Sean Marks be brave and relieve JV of his duties if the losing continues?** 

**The Nets should be better than we are from a W-L perspective. I agree the roster has ill-fitting parts with players duplicating each others skills while players with other necessary skills are not on our roster. It does suck that Ben Simmons isnt healthy but it was always naive to think Ben could be relied upon given the past few years of Bens career. And while BenTen is a difference maker, a triple single isnt getting it done.** 

**Theres little point in rehashing well known arguments such as Dinwiddie being a JV favourite and never has his minutes adjusted despite performing poorly while younger players are put on a much shorter leash.** 

**Its time to make some moves to improve the Nets and improve the mood in the locker room. This is a team still capable of making the post-season while giving its young players some on-court minutes.**

**This roster needs to be shaken up with some trades. Embrace the youth. Allow the players to play to their strengths!** 

**I cant see Sean Marks firing JV this season especially after the bizarre extension he was awarded less than a year ago.** 

**Lets make it known loudly that JV is the one who is holding this team back and it comes down to his decisions about how the players are being utilised on court. The question needs to be asked why are so many of our players performing poorly all at the same time?**",GoNets,47,https://www.reddit.com/r/GoNets/comments/18ycmgi/the_contrarian_nature_of_jacque_vaughn_is_losing/

2024-01-17,1705519241,"Atlanta and Brooklyn touched base earlier in the season about a deal involving Spencer Dinwiddie. (Atlantas interest, presumably, is based on what they would look for if they moved Murray)",,GoNets,61,https://www.reddit.com/r/GoNets/comments/1995339/atlanta_and_brooklyn_touched_base_earlier_in_the/
2024-01-11,1704997185,"[Fischer] Brooklyn has been another potential Dejounte Murray destination mentioned by multiple league personnel, as the Nets are seen as an ideal spot from Murrays side of this dynamic, sources said.","Source: https://sports.yahoo.com/dejounte-murray-emerging-as-perhaps-the-most-likely-all-star-caliber-talent-to-be-moved-174205743.html

&gt; At this juncture, to varying degrees, the Lakers, Knicks, Sixers, Heat and Pistons are five suitors expected to engage Atlanta about acquiring Murray over the coming days and weeks before Feb 8:

&gt; Los Angeles has continued to tell teams it doesnt want to part with Austin Reaves, sources said. There does seem to be a pathway for a Murray-to-Los Angeles deal if the Lakers would be willing to include Reaves, sources said, although that would require the Hawks to send back more value for Los Angeles liking. Around the league, DAngelo Russells $17 million salary has not been viewed as a valuable trade chip for the Lakers to bolster their roster behind LeBron James and Anthony Davis.

&gt; New York is looking at various avenues to upgrade its point guard depth behind Jalen Brunson, sources said, while the Knicks also continue to evaluate center options because of Mitchell Robinsons ankle surgery. Although with Murray in favor of a fresh start, according to sources with knowledge of the situation, it seems questionable that adding the former All-Star to pair with another ball-dominant lead guard like Brunson would have much different results than Murrays partnership with Young. Of note: When Atlanta and New York discussed the 2022 trade that brought Cam Reddish to the Knicks, the Hawks valued Quentin Grimes during those talks, sources said.

&gt; Philadelphia is not in any rush to add a piece or burn any of the Sixers newfound draft capital by way of the Harden trade, sources said. Philly has been conducting due diligence on various point guards available for the trade market  although Tyus Jones doesnt seem to be a target to keep in mind for the Sixers, sources said. If the Hawks dont operate with urgency to find a deal, perhaps a trade could come to fruition for Murray closer to the deadline. That being said, theres little expectation among league figures that the Sixers will pursue Siakam or LaVine during this trade window.

&gt; Miami has left rival teams with the impression that the reigning Eastern Conference champions are looking for ball-handling reinforcements. The Heat are another suitor to keep an eye on for Murray, although there hasnt been anything substantive beyond initial talks between Atlanta and Miami at this point, sources said.

&gt; Detroit can and should have all kinds of options on its board while mired in the leagues cellar at just 3-34. While head coach Monty Williams has routinely shifted his lineups with the mind of figuring out what personnel maximizes franchise engine Cade Cunningham, landing Murray would mark an intriguing upside swing for a rebuilding organization that shared aspirations of competing for the play-in this season. The Pistons being another team monitoring Siakam indicates Detroit is evaluating bigger improvements to the leagues lowest team, even if smaller tweaks are more likely for the Pistons.

&gt; Brooklyn has been another potential Murray destination mentioned by multiple league personnel, as the Nets are seen as an ideal spot from Murrays side of this dynamic, sources said. But Brooklyn and Atlanta havent shared significant dialogue to this point, sources said, and the Nets dont appear to be actively pursuing Murray at this juncture.

&gt; The Bulls have also inquired about Murray, league sources told Yahoo Sports, as part of Chicagos exploratory efforts to return All-Star talent for LaVine. Yet those talks never gained much traction with the Hawks, sources said. And while the Spurs continue to be mentioned by league personnel as a potential landing spot for Murray, San Antonio does not currently bill as a probable outcome for Atlantas trade approach either, sources said.",GoNets,60,https://www.reddit.com/r/GoNets/comments/1948gh9/fischer_brooklyn_has_been_another_potential/

2024-06-30,1719752254,For the first time in a long time I am excited about the future,"I've been a Nets fan since Devin Harris was traded to NJ in 08 as a wee 12 year old and for the first time in 5 years I am genuinely so relieved to have a clear direction in starting fresh. Had so much fun watching the D will/JJ duo even if Billy King screwed this team over for many years and having to rebuild with no assets or draft picks was a nightmare but somehow managed to be somewhat competitive and my fandom peaked in the late 2010's - from 2017 to 2021 I only missed 6 games and that homegrown crop of talent in Dinwiddie, LeVert, J. Allen, Joe Harris, RHG and the emergence of D'Angelo Russell brought me so much joy. The team had so much fun chemistry, the bench reactions going viral - it was probably the most fun Nets basketball has been since the early 2000's. Don't get me wrong I know good and well that core had a very low ceiling and you couldn't pass up the opportunity at KD/Kyrie but thats when I really started to lose interest. It felt like the soul of the organization was ripped apart for a wannabe superteam and the constant drama and disappointments involving those 2 and eventually Harden.. it just didn't feel right. I guess I got used to being one of the forgotten teams in the NBA now being yeeted into the spotlight and became unlikeable. After that obviously didn't work, this team was in SUCH a weird flux and in shambles. Mediocrity followed by Bridges becoming a superstar but even that had a super low ceiling and as much as I liked Bridges I'm so relieved instead of running it back with what we got we dealt him for a huge haul and for once the future looks bright.

**CP: The Mikal Bridges trade sent the Nets in a new direction. What are your expectations for your role this season? Do you think it changes?**

**Thomas:** I wouldnt say it changes, but \[there will\] probably be more of an emphasis on what Im supposed to do, you know, scoring the ball and playmaking for the guys. So I wouldnt necessarily say it changes what I do, because Ive been doing the same thing since Ive been here. Ill probably just take it to a different level, for sure.





**CP: When did you learn about the trade, and what was your reaction?**

**Thomas:** I was getting ready to go back to New York. It was late at night, and I was packing to go back up, actually. And then somebody sent it to me and I was like, Is that real? I was confused. And then they were like, Yeah. I was like, Oh, wow. Whatever happens, happens. I love Mikal. He's a great guy, great player, but I guess thats the direction we gotta go in, so we gotta see how it goes.





**CP: You've seen James Harden, Kyrie Irving, Kevin Durant, and Mikal Bridges traded within less than three seasons. What has it been like adjusting on the fly through all these transactions?**

**Thomas:** Im kinda used to it at this point, all this crazy stuff thats been going on my first three years. Its been crazy, but its just part of the business, like everybody says. You cant really put your feelings into it or dwell on it. This is where \[general manager\] Sean \[Marks\] thinks we should go, so we gotta follow his lead and try to put the best product on the floor. Were gonna try to do that.





**CP: You showed a lot of development during the second half of last year. Do you have any specific goals entering your fourth NBA season?**

**Thomas:** Just being more of a leader. Im really honing in on that and starting early with that. I kind of did it towards the second half of last year because its something I wanted to try as the year went on. Im gonna try to start this year off focusing on that because, honestly, I am \[a leader\]. I think Im the second-longest tenured guy on the team, so I am one of the leaders on the team. So Im definitely trying to hone in on that.

  


**CP: Was there a moment when you felt like you shifted from being one of the young guys to being a leader? When did that reality set in?**

**Thomas:** Probably as soon as the summer started. You look at the roster and youre like, Dang.' Then obviously when Mikal got traded, thats when it really clicked in. Im really one of the longest-tenured guys on the team, so I have a good say on what goes on around here and people listen to what I say. So I definitely wanna be a good resource for the young guys and just help out as much as I can. And obviously, I hope everything leads to wins, but well see.

  


**CP: You're entering the final year of your rookie contract and are eligible for an extension. Have you discussed an extension with the Nets? What do you think your future holds in Brooklyn?**

**Thomas:** I havent really talked about it much. Like I said before, I'm just trying to get ready for the season. Whatever happens, happens. All that is gonna come. Im not really worried about that. If I get minutes and play, I feel like Im one of the best players in the league, and I can really showcase myself. But as far as thinking about that right now, nah, Im not really focused on that. Im just trying to be the best player I can be and just keep getting better and get ready for my fourth year.

The current court represents the Big 3 era and the past 4-5 years overall, and to move forward we should refresh.

Cam is currently seventh in the league in terms of isolation volume at 4.6 possessions per game. His points per possession (PPP) on these isolation possessions is 1.03. 

To me, this is the most intriguing stat that signals Cam's potential star material. Not to be captain obvious, but he's the only non superstar or all star within the top 10 in iso volume, and he's right there with most of them (or even better) in terms of isolation efficiency (PPP). Obviously, we need more of a sample beyond 17 games, but a 22 year old putting up star level isolation production is pretty unique.",GoNets,62,https://www.reddit.com/r/GoNets/comments/18mbg94/cam_thomas_iso/

No, it isnt a guarantee, because nothing is. In a best case scenario we have a 14% chance at Cooper Flagg. I have no delusions this is a sure thing, but I prefer it to bottom-feeding masquerading as mediocrity.

And I mentioned this in another thread, but Im *more* excited to watch the team his year than I was last yearnot because well be better (we wont, and we shouldnt be), but because we can get experimental, take flyers on players, and truly invest in development. And, for the first time since hes joined the team, Im actually looking forward to Ben Simmons.

Every possible scenario is a positive one. If he goes down, were exactly where we expected to be. If he underperforms, we just let his contract expire or waive him. If he somehow stays healthy and balls out like weve been hoping for, hell be fun to watch on a deeply uncompetitive roster. One thing I saw in Ben in his brief semi-productive stretch with us last season is that he can still be a force on defense. Hes strong and fast. If, amidst all of this losing, he can get under a couple of stars skin by disrupting their game, Id love that. 

If hes on the roster come the season opener, Im fine with any outcome. ",GoNets,51,https://www.reddit.com/r/GoNets/comments/1dq7t3p/for_the_first_time_in_his_inauspicious_nets/

A full healthy nets (it'll never happen) with Ben and clax should look at Minnesota and their off the ball work (aside from getting choked out by draymond).

2024-02-02,1706886844,What Brunson is for the Knicks is What We Wanted from Mikal,"27 years old. Villanova product. Was overshadowed by their first team's star (Luka/Booker). Went to new team to be the first option. (One traded, one a free agent) 

And so far, it's working out so much better for the Knicks than it is for us. The trust they gave Brunson is the exact same trust Brooklyn is giving Bridges. 

But Brunson actually is a certified 1st option who's going to make his first All-Star appearance, while Bridges is just kinda keeping his head above water on a crappy team. 

It sucks, because Bridges is still playing good basketball, but it's obvious he's not built to be a 1st option. 2nd, sure. 3rd, you bet. But not 1st. And unfortunately, he doesn't have copious amounts of youth on his side to get better either. What you see, is what you'll get. 

So yeah, I'm jealous af at how the Knicks gave the same blueprint to Brunson that we did to Bridges. But it's working out for them, and not us.",GoNets,114,https://www.reddit.com/r/GoNets/comments/1ah5zt3/what_brunson_is_for_the_knicks_is_what_we_wanted/

We obviously have a lack of a superstar level player, Cam Thomas and Mikal Bridges are both great offensively but not quite a championship level number 1 option I think we can all agree.



But the depth on this team is a pisstake.



Simmons/Spencer/Dennis Smith Jr 


Cam Thomas/Lonnie Walker/Armoni Brooks


Mikal/Royce


Cam Johnson/DFS/Watford

But anyway, has this season been the worst experience you've felt as a Net fan? For me, I'd say no. 

Nothing can really top the constant disgust and depression from last season. The main factor being we were still supposed to be ""contenders"" then. This season, that was not the expectation whatsoever.

Were we supposed to be this bad? No, definitely not. But the low expectations of this season definitely makes me feel more indifference than pure sadness.

&gt; ""This has been an ongoing effort for several months that is expected to be revisited in the six weeks leading up to the June 26 draft, a person with knowledge of the Rockets thinking said.


&gt; This was the subject of the Rockets call to the Nets in January when general manager Rafael Stone sought to offer the Nets picks back to Brooklyn general manager Sean Marks in exchange for the draft picks from the Phoenix Suns that the Nets hold, according to two individuals familiar with the conversation.

That concept was quickly dismissed with the Nets preferring to pursue a playoff or Eastern Conference play-in spot than to lose their way to a stronger first-round pick this season.

*"" I appreciate Dennis, dude was positive, he played well in both starting  and bench roles, maybe he pouted a bit, but he was a professional,  played nice with local media and Sportsnet on interviews too, good for  him, always bigged up Scottie too ""*

  
*"" Loved  Dennis. Professional dude. Looked like he was a good locker room guy  too. Good luck to him. It was nice having a competent two PG rotation  when it happened""*

Regardless of the frustration with the team, it's seems pretty clear the Nets PG situation has improved.  Which is a bit impressive since it costs the Nets no assets, is a cheaper option than anyone else they would bring in next season, and with one year left gives cap flexibility.

1.  I never get tired of that Nets commercial filmed around Brooklyn with the ""You Can't Turn Me Away"" beat.  
2. I initially hated the KAWS uniforms but they've grown on me to the point where I really like them now.  
3. Yeah, the on-court product has been disgusting but the Barclays fan experience has definitely improved.  I skipped a lot of games this year but the ones I went to I saw MOP and Rakim performing at halftime.  For an old school NYC hip hop head like myself, Rakim is legendary.  I got to meet DJ Mister Cee on the concourse one night after performing pregame.  I was there for West Indian Night, that was pretty cool too.  The Chinese New Year games are becoming a can't-miss event each year because of the exclusive merch.  

Any other bright spots this season?  ",GoNets,94,https://www.reddit.com/r/GoNets/comments/1bq0lwp/lets_bring_some_positivity_say_something_nice/

2024-01-30,1706633389,Thank You Nets fans! (Quick trip update).,"Last week I made a post asking for advice on a few things and you guys were all so considerate and welcoming.  Tons of great info and with the help of the search function I was able to do some research and get some relatively good seats for the price (upper corners).

Let me tell you, what an experience.  Im from Canada and the closest NBA team is 1500 miles away.  Ive been to a few games in my time (LA, PHX, TOR)  but Barclays was rocking!!
I Love the Brooklyn Vibe with 90s hip hop and I am so glad you guys embrace Jay Z and Biggie.  I saw the banners next to the Canadian flag lol.

I am so amazed by your city and I wish I had more time.  Ill be back, I didnt even get to do anything besides the game.  You all had some great suggestions for Pizza and Fried Chicken and I was unable to do either (Sad).
Except for Chicken Fingers at Barclays but that doesnt count..  I was so overwhelmed I just hopped in a line and got something. Lol

I under estimated how busy and crazy Brooklyn is but I loved every second of it.
Even though you hear how insane it is, you dont know until you get thrown into it.  We were staying in New Jersey (For work) and I guess I should have asked how the drive is from NJ to Brooklyn lol
We should have just Ubered it.  After the white knuckle drive (Our busiest roads are 2 lanes and you can get anywhere in the city within 25 minutes Lol) and the attempt to find parking.  We were regretting it.  BUT, I think everyone needs to experience it just once.  We did find parking, and it was 75% of the cost of taking an uber&.  Maybe the most impressive thing I saw that night was how this parking garage was able to Tetris in 60+ cars into a space that looked like it could fit 20.
 
Anyways Im rambling.  Ill be back.  Thank you all, I love your city and most of it I saw from a distance.  You are all very lucky to be a part of such a special place.

Hell, I'm not even a Nets fan, I'm a Knicks fan (I grew up in Brooklyn, but they only moved there once I was already an adult). All of that being said. I love what I'm seeing out of Ben Simmons so far. I felt like he got mentally destroyed in Philly. He was the punchline of so many jokes, it seemed like  no one believed in him. My boy is averaging 7.4pts, 7.2 ast and 10 reb so far. I feel like this guy is starting to get it again and I'm so happy to see it. He has so much talent and just needed to figure some things out and get mentally and physically healthy.

2024-09-22,1727000344,"Honestly, did anybody expect that 2014 will be the last time we get to see KG in the Playoffs?","I'm pretty sure most of you are already aware of the disastrous 2013-14 Brooklyn Nets team that was supposed to compete with the Miami Heat for an NBA championship and had to give up tons of assets just to get washed up stars
 Paul Pierce and Kevin Garnett, which set them back years, and of course, we all knew what happened as they got trounced by the Heat in 5 games.

However, one thing that some of us didn't expect is the fact that the 2014 Playoffs would turn out to be KG's last ever appearance in the postseason. Garnett, 37, put up career lows across across the boards in 6.9 points and 6.3 rebounds per game.",GoNets,29,https://www.reddit.com/r/GoNets/comments/1fmq0qr/honestly_did_anybody_expect_that_2014_will_be_the/
2024-07-28,1722208147,[Scotto:] Reports Brooklyn is among The Teams interest in a Sign and Trade for Isaac Okoro,"https://preview.redd.it/i9i48xpmccfd1.png?width=1024&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8f0d7ae419ad801dd5e9c1c7342a51e879dfbc4b



With the end of July nearing, **Lauri Markkanen** is the next big domino to fall either via a renegotiation and extension with the Utah Jazz or a trade to another team, as the league is seemingly in a holding pattern until then. Pelicans forward **Brandon Ingram** also has been a hot topic in trade chatter as he enters the final year of his contract. Other trade talks involving the Brooklyn Nets, including forwards **Dorian Finney-Smith** and **Cam Johnson**, are also worth monitoring.

Meanwhile, in free agency, Cleveland Cavaliers restricted free agent **Isaac Okoro** is the top player available on the market according to our [HoopsHype rankings](https://hoopshype.com/lists/2024-nba-free-agent-rankings-top-players-available-this-summer/). However, a decision on his future could come soon for the 23-year-old wing. Okoro could be dealt in a sign-and-trade deal, re-signed by Cleveland to a multi-year contract, or sign his one-year qualifying offer.

Okoro, the No. 5 overall pick of the 2020 NBA Draft, has become a notable 3-and-D wing after shooting a career-high 39.1 percent to complement his strong perimeter defense. 

Below is a look at how all three scenarios could play out, where things stand now, and what the final decision could be. 



The Cleveland Cavaliers are believed to have a high asking price for Okoro in sign-and-trade discussions.

Several teams have expressed interest in executing a sign-and-trade with Cleveland for Okoro, which could potentially land him above the non-taxpayer mid-level exception annually, HoopsHype has learned. 

The Nets are among the teams considered a sign-and-trade possibility for Okoro, though nothing is considered imminent with Brooklyn, sources said. As previously reported by HoopsHype, Nets forward **Dorian Finney-Smith** has drawn [trade interest](https://hoopshype.com/lists/nba-rumors-demar-derozan-brandon-ingram-buddy-hield-malik-beasley-free-agency-trades/) from Cleveland and has come up in discussions for Okoro, sources said. Cleveland is also intrigued by **Cam Johnson**, according to reports.

""Mikal All-Star (No All Star, PPG plummeted, FT% took a huge dip, TO increased, not a great season at all, but Im hopeful it was just an off year, still have to give an&) F

""Cam Thomas Defensive and Playmaking improvements (Slight improvement on those ends, but enough to where Im happy about it) B

""Clowney, Whitehead, and Wilson (This one is super hard to grade, Whitehead=N/A, Wilson and Clowney played mostly in the G-League, but looked solid on the squad) C+

""Claxton expand offensive bag w/ mid range game and threes (Didnt happen lo. But I wouldnt argue if you think this was an unrealistic expectationl) F

""Win the Kyrie trade (DFS was super underwhelming, Dinwiddie became the worst shooter in the NBA playing for us and cut from the Raptors, hopefully the FRP turns into something good) F

""Cam Johnson contract being worth it (Numbers went down, has been relegated to coming off the bench, 20 mil is wayyyyyy too much) F

2024-02-02,1706893590,We need to become the Thunder,"Trade Mikal to HOU for our picks back and deal everyone over 25 to desperate teams for draft picks. We'll be a bottom feeding team with at least the upside of CT, Clax and whichever hopeful players come back from dealing the older guys. Only difference is we'll have our own picks to look forward to along with a war chest of picks from PHX, DAL, + the return from trading Cam J, DFS, Royce, etc.


This is the current OKC model that has given them a 5 year minimum championship window with a group of homegrown guys that are easy to root for.


Right now our current upside is a first round exit. Even dealing our picks/assets for a potentially disgruntled star like Mitchell probably wouldn't be enough to take us past the 2nd round.",GoNets,94,https://www.reddit.com/r/GoNets/comments/1ah8luf/we_need_to_become_the_thunder/

Also, if you want to get more advanced, his effective fg% was 48% ranking him #414 in the entire NBA, which is third worst in the NBA for players averaging 30+ minutes per game.[https://www.nba.com/stats/players/advanced?CF=MIN\*GE\*30&amp;SeasonType=Regular%20Season&amp;dir=D&amp;sort=EFG\_PCT](https://www.nba.com/stats/players/advanced?CF=MIN*GE*30&amp;SeasonType=Regular%20Season&amp;dir=D&amp;sort=EFG_PCT)

edit:  (The only two players with worse effective FG% are Jordan Clarkston and Shaedon Sharpe - both of whom were moved from starter to bench players two months ago by their respective teams)

&amp;#x200B;

2024-08-19,1724104768,"SlamOnline: Brooklyn Nets Guard Cam Thomas Discusses His Offseason, Staying True to Himself and Proving the Doubters Wrong","https://preview.redd.it/5b8bavsxzojd1.jpg?width=1080&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=20dde07cb6a722d646b4c95f4cb2a9adaecf96e9



&gt;Cam Thomas has always gotten his buckets in bunches&a lot of buckets in bunches.

&gt;He led the entire Hampton Roads area in scoring as a freshman at Oscar Smith High School in Chesapeake, VA. He left Oak Hill Academy as the programs all-time leading scorer despite having only played there for his junior and senior seasons. He then led all NCAA DI freshmen in scoring during his sole season at LSU. It didnt matter who Cam played with or against. His responsibility was always the same: score, score and score some more.

&gt;That all changed when he fell into the Brooklyn Nets lap at pick No. 27 in the 2021 NBA Draft. Not only would he be joining an organization with championship-or-bust expectations, but he was also joining a roster that wasnt hurting for scoring. Do the names Kevin Durant, Kyrie Irving and James Harden ring a bell?

&gt;On one hand, Cam had first-class access to work with and learn from three of the best offensive players in hoops history. On the other, he had to wait his turn and deal with inconsistent playing time, something hed never experienced at that point in his young career. Even then, Cam never lost even the smallest bit of confidence. It was tested, but that confidence is what got him here. And theres a tad bit of crazy mixed in there, too. All the greats have it. But we know how the phrase goes: Its only crazy until you do it.

&gt;In the sparing minutes he was given, Cam showed flashes of his scoring brilliance. Yet, on any given night, he could play anywhere from four minutes to 17 minutes or even have a DNP. It was like this for most of his first two years in the League.

&gt;And then, in February 2023&he erupted. Amidst the Nets moving on from their big three of KD, Kyrie and Harden and trying to figure out what direction theyd move in, Cam got a few more windows of opportunity. And he took full advantage. With Harden long gone, Kyrie just traded to Dallas and KD in trade rumors, Cam was unleashed. It all came together as he made history, becoming the youngest player to score 40-plus points in three straight games. And these 40-pieces were efficient, the works of a true professional scorer.

&gt;This past 23-24 season, it started to slowly but surely all come together. Cam started in 51 of the 66 games he played in, averaging 22.5 points in about 31 minutes per game, a 12-point increase and 15-minute increase from the season prior.

&gt;And now were here. The Nets just completed a massive trade, and there are many questions about which direction the team is headed. Theres also an entirely new coaching staff, including Jordi Fernandez at the helm. But even with all the questions, theres one thing that is for certain. The Nets have a more than capable number one scoring option in Cam Thomas.

&gt;Its a warm Friday afternoon in July at SLAM HQ in New York, and the 6-3, 22-year-old combo guard who sits across from us is on the brink of what will be, one way or another, a defining season in his career. He sat down to discuss his offseason, proving doubters wrong, his love for Kobe Bryant and more.

**SLAM: Hows the offseason been going?**

**Cam Thomas:** Its been good. Just laying low, resetting, getting ready for next season. Its been real good.

**SLAM: Have you developed some sort of routine, or do you approach each offseason differently?**

**CT:** I usually try to go with a clean slate because you never know. Stuff changes from year to year, like coaches, schemes, etc. This summer was probably the longest I took offabout two or three weeks. Then I got right back to it.

**SLAM: Youre mostly known for your ability to score at the highest level, and youve improved as a scorer each year since entering the League. Are there any specific things youre focused on improving for next season?**

**CT:** Nah, not really. I just want to keep working on everything. Last summer, I tried to put more emphasis on catch-and-shoot shooting, and I think I was way up in the League percentage-wise on catch-and-shoot \[this past season\]. So, just continue to work on that and fine-tuning the skills I had coming into the League, like my off-the-dribble stuff and finishing around the basket, \[while\] still improving on catch-and-shoot, trying to have the best percentage in the League.

**SLAM: The Nets were part of one of the biggest moves this offseason when Mikal Bridges went across the bridge to the Knicks. This positions you for the biggest role of your career thus far. How have you begun to approach and prepare for this increased role, not only physically but mentally?**

**CT:** Just knowing that and embracing it. Attacking it head-on. Ive kind of been having those roles \[as the leader of the team\] ever since I was in high school and college. So, Im not really worried about it. Im just excited to get it going and to try to do it in the League. Im not really worried about it at all; Im just ready.

**SLAM: Youre on a short list of the most talented young guards in the NBA. What do you think you need to do to get to that next level?**

**CT:** Just doing everythingdoing it consistently. I had the biggest jump in points from my second year to my third year. I was at 22.5 \[points per game\], so I think trying to get into that 25 ppg range, upping the playmaking and just trying to keep improving my all-around game. And hopefully, it leads to wins.

**SLAM: Are you inspired by the doubters, or would you say youre completely self-motivated?**

**CT:** Its a little bit of both&I dont really worry about the doubters because Ive always had them. Nobody really believed in my talent and scoring abilityeven at Oak Hill, and even in college, and even in the League. So, Im used to it. Now, its really just self-motivation. Even down to sliding in the draft all the way down to pick 27. I still carry that chip on my shoulder. And even with the Nets, not playing consistently my first two years. I have that in my back pocket so I can keep growing and keep improving&to show why you should have played me in my first two years.

Im not focused on trying to prove myself anymore. Everybody knows Im one of the top young scorerstop young guardsin the League now. So, its really just trying to maximize my ability, see where I can take it and become the best player I can be, this year, and for years to come.

**SLAM: Theres clearly a lofty confidence you must have to be an elite scorer in the League, let alone as an undersized guard. What do you think is the main source of that mentality?**

**CT:** Id probably say growing up in \[the Hampton Roads area\]. Its physical there. Everybodys fighting for the same goal, sports-wise. I feel that helped me in a way. And really&Kobe Bryant. Just reading his mentality and idolizing him, thats a part of it, too. Thats really how I shaped my mentality: Kobe and my hometown. At the same time, thats just in me.

**SLAM: Do you have any specific individual or team goals for next season? Are you concerned with All-Star, All-NBA and those types of individual accolades?**

**CT:** Individually, I just try to stay in the moment. Whatever happens, happens. If I get it, I get it. If I dont, I dont. I just want to keep improving. As far as the team, the goal is to be better every day and try to win as many games as we can. Honestly, we dont know what our team could look like going into next season. But whatever it looks like, we just want to be the best team we can be and try to put a good product on the floor for Brooklyn.

**SLAM: What should Nets fans and Cam Thomas fans expect next season?**

**CT:** Excitement. Entertainment. \[Im\] hoping everything leads to wins at the end of the day. Well see. Its different in the League. But Im prepared, not worried at all. Ive done it in the League, but I want to take it to another level, for sure.

If there was one player we had to choose to hang their jersey in the rafters from the Marks era (post Brook Lopez) it would be Smoking Joe, Joey Buckets, Beef Jerky Joe or whatever you want to call him. When we talk about what we want the Nets to stand for, its Joe.

Damn the Grinch for zapping his skills by stealing his ankles and shipping him to the worst environment in the NBA.

2024-04-16,1713238710,Final puzzle piece of why Bruce Brown was not resigned (Durant was mad at him for flopping),"For the past two seasons there has been a lot of frustration that the Nets did not resign Bruce Brown and instead let him walk to Denver.  The fact that the Nets spent similar money on resigning Patty Mills made fan frustration of the situation even worse - as Mills was clearly in decline.  

With that, last season some whispers started coming out of what happened.  Brown stated that management and ownership liked him but it was other players that didn't want him around.  [https://www.reddit.com/r/GoNets/comments/13ruv77/kaplan\_bruce\_brown\_honestlyi\_dont\_think\_it\_was/](https://www.reddit.com/r/GoNets/comments/13ruv77/kaplan_bruce_brown_honestlyi_dont_think_it_was/)

Then, it came out that Durant may be the guy that didn't want Brown back [https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/145qc90/kevin\_durant\_getting\_in\_more\_beef\_with\_nets/](https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/145qc90/kevin_durant_getting_in_more_beef_with_nets/)

Today it comes out that Durant is angry that a Bruce Brown flop was why he got injured.  [https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/1c51fg1/durant\_i\_had\_my\_teammate\_flop\_into\_me\_and\_an/](https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/1c51fg1/durant_i_had_my_teammate_flop_into_me_and_an/)  \- honestly it looks like a flop.  video:  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1OTntCq6qg](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1OTntCq6qg)

  
So there it is;  Durant was pissed at Brown for flopping and causing his injury - and you have to assume that it was Durant that told Nets management to not resign the guy.

2024-04-17,1713378924,Happy Birthday Nic Claxton,"&gt; Nic Claxton feels good about his game as he prepares for free agency this summer, per HoopsHype's Michael Scotto. The Brooklyn Nets center is coming off a two-year, $17.250 million contract, and he thinks taking a smaller deal will pay off this offseason.

&gt; ""I feel great. I'm in a great situation,"" Claxton said. ""These past couple of years have been really good. I somewhat gambled on myself with a shorter contract, and it's all paying off.""

&gt; As he embarks on his free agency journey, he said being on a winning team is a priority.

&gt; ""Winning,"" Claxton said. ""Being a playoff team and winning games.""

&gt; Since signing the two-year deal ahead of the 2022-23 season, Claxton has put together a pair of solid seasons. He averaged a career-high 12.9 points and 9.2 rebounds per game last year before putting up 11.9 points and 10 rebounds per game this season. Most importantly, Claxton has stayed healthy for back-to-back years after dealing with injuries to start his career.

&gt; Claxton has become a solid offensive player around the rim, but his defensive game has elevated the most over the past two years. He averaged a career-high 2.5 blocks per game a season ago, which was the second-best mark in the league. This year, he's rejecting 2.1 shots per game.

&gt; Claxton made it clear he wants to be on a winning team after free agency, but what isn't clear is whether he will stick with Brooklyn through a rebuild or leave for a more established team. He has been with the Nets his entire five-year career, but that could come to an end in free agency.

&gt; The Nets have the potential to be a playoff team, but they are likely one or two pieces away from being a threat in the East. If Brooklyn could bring in more star power, it could help the team retain Claxton.


What would be your pay off ceiling for Nic Claxton? Do you think the Nets will and should do everything to keep him in Brooklyn?",GoNets,6,https://www.reddit.com/r/GoNets/comments/1c6hgtm/happy_birthday_nic_claxton/

Of course he would instantly be our best player, make the Nets infinitely more watchable, and get us into the playoffs in the East.

But aren't we fucking tired of that? The last time I saw the Nets draft in the top 10 it was Derrick fucking Favors, and I have watched so much bad basketball since. If you're telling me I sat through a bunch of Lionel Hollins, Jason Kidd, and Jauque Vaughn Nets game to earn being a max-2nd round exit team, I'm going to be pissed.

Either we use these draft picks and have a sustainably built contender in 5-6 years (sure, that's a long time to suck but at least I can watch young guys grow and root for them), or we trade them for a genuine floor raiser like Luka.

2024-02-08,1707356933,Dear Nets Fans,"I just wanted to write this because I am seeing alot of disgruntled fans throughout social media. And you have every right to be frustrated, angry, and confused. Hell I know I am, but  with that being said let's still support the team. I get it some of  you don't want to support the Nets because they're trash right now but if you rooted for every team that was doing better and more popular at the moment wouldn't that make you a bandwagoner? If you can't support the team through bad times than you don't need to be celebrating when the good times come around. Everybody want to act like they're embarrassed to be Nets fans now but I'm NOT. There's no integrity or fun being a fan of every hype beast team that comes around.  I am going to be proud to be a Nets fan whether we're good or not, I don't care when people say nobody cares about the Nets because I care about them. I don't care when people spit the same regurgitated BS about us having no fans because if there's only 10 Nets fans THAN I am going to be one of them. There's nothing people love more than to kick the Nets when they are down. Some of you sit up here and really care about what the Knick pundits and the Knick fan base says.  Some of you act like you need approval from some of these people in order to feel better about being a Nets fan. I got news for you there always going to have something to say that's because they hate the Nets mere existence. Stop caring about the opinions of those who pray on our demise. Be proud no matter what they say, support your  team, and never let anybody make you feel bad about the team you love! Because my friend this is sports and in sports those tables always turn and they can turn pretty fast in the NBA. I been rocking with this team ever since they moved to BK and embraced the borough and I am going to continue doing so. I know this franchise has been through alot. I have read alot about this team's history and their fight not only to stay in the NYC metropolitan area but in the NBA. I love the Nets and to all my faithful die hard Nets fans I love you. In the words of my man Jay-Z "" I told him less is more,  ni\*\*a it's plenty of us "". Gods Speed Ya''ll!",GoNets,38,https://www.reddit.com/r/GoNets/comments/1alk3le/dear_nets_fans/

2024-04-10,1712775008,Mikal Bridges on his future with the Nets My intention is definitely to stay here. I got nowhere else to be.,"&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/21fr2def7ptc1.png?width=1400&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=03dda7eb9d31b03ddd4a55d4f3590ac576c758c4

Mikal Bridges says it hasnt really hit him yet that he will miss the playoffs for the first time since 2020, but that is the dire reality of the situation for the Nets.

Brooklyn will play out the string with its final three games of the season this week, beginning with their last home game Wednesday night against the also-eliminated Raptors at Barclays Center.

Its not fun at all, Bridges said after practice Tuesday in Brooklyn. It still hasnt hit me yet. When the season ends, it probably will. But its not fun.

Obviously, you want to keep playing. The last time I was here \[in a non-playoff situation\], it \[was\] probably my second year in the league with the Suns. Yeah, you dont want to be done in April.

The 27-year-old Bridges, who was acquired at last seasons trade deadline from Phoenix in the Kevin Durant blockbuster, has two guaranteed years remaining on his contract with a salary-cap hit of $23.3 million for 2024-25.

Asked about how he is approaching the offseason, and the franchises long-term direction, Bridges said he fully expects to be back with the Nets.

Yeah, 100 percent. I dont think I look at anywhere else, Bridges said. I dont think about my contract at all. Just try and come back, and my biggest thing this summer is to be better than I was this year. Take a lot from what I learned.

Obviously it was not what I wanted and what we wanted as a team, but you cant really sulk about it. Didnt play your best. Thats cool. Might get some hate for it, but just get in the gym, get better and learn from it. My intention is definitely to stay here. I got nowhere else to be.

Bridges has appeared in all 79 games so far, and hes averaging 20.0 points per game, a drop from the 26.1 he posted in 27 appearances last spring following the trade.

That helped the Nets secure the No. 6 playoff position in the Eastern Conference, though they were swept in the first round by the 76ers.

The Nets will conduct a coaching search this summer after Kevin Ollie was named the interim replacement when Jacque Vaughn was fired with a 21-33 record in February.

The Nets are 10-15 under Ollie  who led his alma mater, Connecticut, to an NCAA championship in 2014  and in 11th place in the East at 31-48 overall.

Asked if he hopes to be consulted about the coaching search or personnel moves this summer, Bridges replied, \[Whatever\] they want, man. I just try to play basketball. They know I want to win, and \[they will\] figure out the best guy to help us win.

In the meantime, the former Villanova star said he must keep attacking the days until the regular season concludes with road games against the Knicks (Friday) and the 76ers (Sunday).

The seasons not over yet, so just keep playing strong, finishing strong, Bridges said. Times like this, especially out of the playoffs, you kind of relax, and so just stay with it and continue to \[finish\] the season strong.

Bridges, named one of 12 finalists for the leagues Teammate of the Year award, said he understands the final games will be about learning more about young players such as Noah Clowney and Jalen Wilson.

Wednesday night also marks the teams Fan Appreciation night for the Barclays faithful.

Its tough, this season were having. A lot of losing \[even though there were\] a lot of expectations this year, Bridges said. But for them to even come here when were not playing at our best shows \[they are\] true fans.

There might be some who arent true fans, \[those\] who dont show when were losing, but I appreciate everybody who still comes \[while\] were trying to figure this thing out and everything.

Now yes, our ceiling can only go so high with him at the 1, but he's doing his utmost regardless. 

I think his pairing with Thomas needs to be a staple within the offense, that way he can focus more on just facilitating. But man, I'm just so glad we got him right now. Steady vet who is a great lockerroom presence. Swiss army knife type of skillset. Good size. I mean, there's no doubt I want to extend him. Hope he retires a Net.

2024-02-15,1708000174,It's time to nuke the Nets,"Let me get this off my chest. I watch basically every game. I've posted on and off here since the sub started. 


**The Good Times**

Hear me out on Sean Marks:

The Prokohov era was extremely bleak. Even when we were a 2nd round playoff team, we were playing a selfish, leaderless brand of basketball, and there were constant rumblings the team resented each other. As more info has come out over the years, it seems like Brook and Iso Joe were the only two who kept their cool. 

Sean took the scraps of that era and a terrible team culture, and built a legit franchise with a bunch of late first rounders and G-league castaways. If y'all remember, Prokohov and Sean immediately had tension around Prokohov's ""win now, give up the farm"" philosophy. Sean wanted to be patient. 

Sean built a staff with elite player development. Kenny and co. turned Brook into Splash mountain, gave D'Lo the best years of his career, transformed borderline guys like Dinwiddie and Joe Harris into legit NBA starters. Resurrected the careers of guys on perceived shit contracts like Demarre Carroll.

Sean went on a sick run of drafts: Caris at the end of the 1st, Jarrett Allen at 22, Clax (and even Kurucs) at the end of the 2nd.

Then, the opportunity presents itself. KD, Kyrie, Harden. We send it.

**The Bad**

Borderline *nothing* since then makes any fucking sense. 

A first for Shamet. As much as we love Royce, a first for him was a head-scratcher. 

The *only* silver lining is Sean continues to crush finding value in the draft- CT and Dayron late in the 1st, and Jalen Wilson at 51 is cracked. 

The coaching debacle: as much as we lamented Kenny's rotations back in the day, he has *nothing* on the sort of dogshit we've seen since. Nash and JV's rotation decisions, timeout usage, etc is incoherent, got Nash canned fast, and is a constant source of frustration for the fans and players.

If there is even an inkling of truth in the rumors that we declined getting even a couple of our picks back from Houston for Mikal, nuke everything.

JV has lost the lockerroom. A bought-in team, no matter how talentless, does not lose by 50. Period. Schroeder seems cool, but he can't singlehandedly repair this bombed out franchise.

**SO WHAT NOW**

Is this Sean's masterplan? Sticking to a core of Mikal and CT to sell tickets? Attempting to soft-rebuild as a play-in team? Then can him. He's an amazing drafter, wherever he lands, they'll be stoked with his talent evaluation in the later stages of the draft. But it is criminal to get the return he got for Harden, and to stand by JV and this roster. 


Is all of this Joe Tsai in Sean's ear? If so, Sean needs to smack Joe's tiny ass upside the head and dunk him in ice water- I believe in the late 2010's Sean, not whatever the fuck we're seeing now. 

WHOEVER IT IS, IF IT'S ALL OF THEM, GET THEM ALL OUT. We're losing the only thing we've had going for us in the Marks/Tsai era- our reputation as a competent, well-staffed organization. If we're making fucking KYRIE look vindicated AT ALL then there is a problem. Fuck that guy, fuck this team, blow it up.

2024-01-01,1704071684,[Rant] Tired of this fanbase,"I get that the journey over the last couple years has been rough, with going from a legit contender in the big three era to where were are now, but people need to get a fucking grip and get behind this squad. Do we need a superstar? Yes. Should we screw ourselves in the short term to get one before we have better trade value in developing players or a better understanding of what this squad is capable of? No. Could we use a better coach than JV? Yes. Do we have a better option? No. People need to realise that if were actually gonna win a chip we need to be patient and determine what our options are, whether trades or otherwise. If that means being slightly above .500 for a season or two thats just the way it is. 

All of that aside I am sometimes ashamed to be a Nets fan, and not because of our record or for any of the reasons listed above - but because our fanbase fucking blows. People constantly bitching on this sub after every loss, empty seats at every game (I go to games frequently and have seen as much), barely any noise at said games. 

People gotta realise that regardless of their paycheque etc these guys want to play, and I like to think they give 100% on the court every game. Its what we do best - being a scrappy no bullshit team win or lose. But regardless of trade prospects or what might happen going forward we need to get behind this group. I cant overstate how important a teams culture and their fans are - and thats one of our weaker points. 

I apologise to all of the fans to whom none of the above applies, I really do. But the constant bitching has to stop. That aside, I am happy at how this team sometimes surprises me with their level of play, and I believe good things are to come regardless of how deep a run we make this season. 

We have some great assets and young players, and their value will only get higher as they improve. We have some burgeoning superstars on both ends of the floor who just need a bit of a jump in some areas - things could be worse.

2023-12-28,1703792531,It's getting kinda silly now...,"...the way people are reacting to last night's game. There was literally *nothing* on the line last night except for our player's health. Aside from that, though, some of you are acting like you didn't know this year would be a year where the team remained competitive while developing talent. I didn't hear anyone complaining when the game was close through 3 quarters and all these bench players were giving fans a sneak peek of what they might bring to the table down the road. I bet I won't hear anyone complaining when we're happy to see everyone who sat playing max minutes on this upcoming road trip either. Part of getting through an entire season is being mindful of balance and that was what happened last night. Vaughn didn't ""fuck up"" and he didn't treat the game like an exhibition (the funniest thing I've heard in the past 12 hours) and he's not immune to criticism, but some of what's being said about him in this instance is borderline mental. People really wanna see him fired over this? The Nets are not in contention for a title. They have the luxury of being able to give younger players some run and experiment a little bit. Just enjoy the games and be glad there's no drama with ego-maniac stars anymore. ",GoNets,106,https://www.reddit.com/r/GoNets/comments/18t2ks2/its_getting_kinda_silly_now/

2024-04-15,1713147882,"Let me blossom. I know what I can be in this league.  -CJ Holmes end of the season exclusive, featuring Cam Thomas. ","

Cam Thomas ceiling has been a wildly divisive subject since the Nets selected him 27th overall in the 2020 NBA Draft. His professional journey thus far has been widely defined by two conflicting narratives  and he is intimately familiar with both.

When I was younger [it bothered me], but now I really dont care because the numbers speak for themselves, Thomas told the Daily News.

Some believe Thomas, who averaged 22.5 points, 3.2 rebounds and 2.9 assists while shooting 44.2% from the field, 36.4% from the 3-point line and 85.6% from the charity stripe in his third NBA season, possesses enough natural scoring talent to blossom into one of the better backcourt options in the league.

Many of Thomas supporters value buckets above all else. In Thomas 66 appearances for Brooklyn this season, they saw a future All-Star worthy of league-wide recognition.

However, others are not as optimistic about Thomas upside. That faction of critics believe Thomas is too one dimensional, pointing out flaws in other areas of his game that would ultimately prevent him from developing true No. 1 or No. 2 option on a winning team.

They do not think Thomas will ever be a guy who can consistently take advantage of the gravity his scoring commands to create winning offense for the players around him. They doubt he will ever develop into an impactful defensive player.

The Nets finished 32-50 this season  so bad that they failed to qualify for the leagues Play-In Tournament. Brooklyn went 23-43 with Thomas in the lineup, but the teams struggles this season did not fall on him alone. There was plenty of dysfunction to go around.

Neither narrative that follows Thomas has an edge at this point in his development, but the 22-year-old has objectively improved across the board. Playing far more minutes than he had in his first two NBA seasons (31.5 per game), he started 51 of 66 games, doubled his scoring average, bettered his rebounding and assist averages and turned the ball over only 1.9 times per game.

Thomas had 15 games with at least 30 points this season and scored at least 40 points four times. Most young players, despite their shortcomings, would be universally praised for that level of offensive production.

Adding to Thomas individual success, just to name a few accolades, he became the first Nets player to ever average at least 20 points per game and less than two turnovers for an entire season. His improvement as a passer was evident, as he had seven games with at least five assists over his last 21 appearances. And he joined some elite company Friday night against the Knicks, becoming the sixth player 22 years or younger to post a 40-point game inside Madison Square Garden, joining Michael Jordan, Shaquille ONeal, Kyrie Irving, Nikola Jokic and Trae Young.

My numbers are up there with some of the best of them, honestly, Thomas told the Daily News. Mine are just overlooked because not that many people know me, Im not the most vocal, talking and all that stuff. But if you just look at my numbers, my numbers are up there with some of the best of them& I think I just go under the radar a little bit because Im not really on social media as much.

Thomas viewed 2023-24 as his true rookie season. Sticking to that logic, he exceeded expectations in many ways, continuing to improve his game in spite of coaching changes, injuries, a fluctuating role and organizational chaos around him.

Ive just been trying to get my rhythm back, Thomas told the Daily News. I feel like this year was really just a start for me. I feel like I have so much more room to grow. Thats what this year was for, to look at it and see where I can get even better.

Thomas believes he is ready to take another significant leap next season regardless of the Nets roster or whatever coach is in place. He wants to prove that he can be an all-around player who can impact winning. It is not necessarily about being a first-time All-Star or capitalizing on the final year of his current deal.

For him, it is about finally being respected for the player he is.

I just want people to see that I have the potential to do that instead of just trying to keep me low, Thomas told the Daily News. Let me blossom. I know what I can be in this league.

Honestly, I just want to be respected and for people to have the same kind of energy toward me [that they give to others].",GoNets,14,https://www.reddit.com/r/GoNets/comments/1c4b43g/let_me_blossom_i_know_what_i_can_be_in_this/

2024-03-08,1709942068,Not trading Bridges to Houston for our picks back was worse than anything that happened in the big 3 era ,"Was a ton of stuff during the big 3 era a disaster? Primarily both harden trades, absolutely. But I believe just about everything they did was justifiable at the time. 

Not trading Mikal to Houston for our picks back was a fireable offense.  Zach Lowe said on his podcast multiple times the Rockets offered all the picks back. Reading everyones reporting it seems the only pick that Houston was a little shakey giving back was this draft, but everyone says this draft stinks anyways and nets would have been free to rebuild.

Youd have all your picks going forward, plus your 6 extra firsts from other trades, and then you can trade Johnson, Claxton, DFS for even more firsts.

The front office and/or ownership is in complete denial about this team. I have been advocating for a rebuild since the offseason and was called a Mikal hater for saying last year was not sustainable. Mikal and his contract is worth infinitely more to a team that is trying to win than the Nets. 

You cant try and be competitive with no all star talent and a dead max salary spot on your books. Once it became Simmons was done 
(which was basically his Nets debut if were being honest) the team had to face reality. 

The nets are punting on another season to pray that free agency comes back in 2025, stars just resign and ask out later now. And if we have to trade for say Donovan Mitchell, we will be a play in team with little to no assets. 

The Nets have been burned to historic proportions star chasing. Part of why our crowd is so awful is its been 15+ years since the Nets have had anything that resembles a homegrown team that stayed together. Thats what builds fanbases, and you build a homegrown team through the draft and by rebuilding. 

Would it suck to be bad for 2 years? Sure, but it would be sucking with a purpose and a plan, developing young talent who play hard every night. Now we suck for no reason.

2024-01-18,1705561859,The Harden trade changed me as a Nets fan,"I was a ride or die Nets fan since the Kerry Kittles days. 12-70 was dismal, but I never felt embarrassed to root for this team. This year is the first time Im ashamed to call myself a Nets fan. And the turning point for me was the Harden trade.

I hear a lot of Nets fans call the Harden trade a no-brainer. Say they would do it again ten times over. Fair position. But not only do I hate it now, I hated it at the time. We traded all of our depth, all of our flexibility, all of the guys we built our culture with for a single guy who only wanted us only because it seemed like his clearest path to a ring. 

At that point I struggled to even understand what it means to be a fan. I wasnt watching guys we drafted, discovered, nurtured. Instead it was a bunch of guys who just showed up In Brooklyn overnightwho seemed like they would have been just as happy in any other jersey. So what was I rooting for? Joe Tsai and Sean Marks? The city of Brooklyn? It didnt even feel like a team to me. So because we went all-in, I went all-in: I started feeling like the only way to justify our moves was winning it all. Championship or bust. I went from being a loyal Nets fan to feeling like anything less than a championship was a waste of my time.

And now here we are: As far away from contention as we were when Marks first took over. A roster built around defense that plays putrid defense. A coach on a long-term deal who seems lost. A (not so) young core that looks completely overwhelmed and outmatched night after night, no matter whos on the other end of the floor. In any other scenario Id take solace in Bridges leadership or Watfords spark plug play. But instead Im just bitter and tired. And the path were on now feels like ripping a band-aid off one hair at a time.

Respect to anyone who disagrees, but this is the lowest Ive felt as a fan. They sold us on championship aspirations, blew it in record time, and now treat success this season as finishing with a better record than the Pistons, Spurs, and Wizards. If a band I love releases a bunch of bad albums in a row, I stop seeing them live. It doesnt mean Im not a fan. It just means I need a break. And right now, with this team, Im in desperate need of a break. 

I feel sorry for the guys suffering through this situation right now. I imagine theyd rather be anywhere else.",GoNets,105,https://www.reddit.com/r/GoNets/comments/199kb90/the_harden_trade_changed_me_as_a_nets_fan/

I know this might be wrong but from my research from Stat-muse and other sources hes only sank 5 3s out of 36 attempts  We now see ben not even doing one of his most used offensive plays& hes not even trying to get to the rim like that anymore as last game he had 1/2 FG, sure 50% but for someone who now has open space to be a star its not impressive   He actively shows anxiety and a lot more, I truly think its time to accept ben is not ever going to improve and if so itll be to late, in the next 2-3 years hell be 30& and hell be a 9-10+ year player  I think its time to accept hes done ",GoNets,158,https://www.reddit.com/r/GoNets/comments/1b0x3p6/why_do_people_still_expect_ben_simmons_to_be_good/
