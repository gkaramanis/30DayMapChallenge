He's been helping to guide the younger guys, competing night to night, saying the right things and putting up some great performances day in and day out.

I'm sure he's been expecting a mutual move-on all along, but it's refreshing to have such a solid pro on the team for a bit. 
He handles and protects the ball at an elite level, scores with ease and always seems to make the right decisions. We'll deserve the high price he commands - it's kinda insane how Boston gave up so much for Jrue in the 1st place (Brog, RW3, 2 1sts).",ripcity,15,https://www.reddit.com/r/ripcity/comments/19e6ekf/malcolm_brogdon_appreciation_thread/

2024-02-27,1709063384,An Interesting Ayton Nugget,"I was trolling through basketball reference to pass some time today and noticed that Ayton is in the [top 10 all time in career FG%](https://www.basketball-reference.com/leaders/fg_pct_career.html), currently sitting in 8th place. The list is predictably filled with guys who do basically nothing but dunk, with DeAndre Jordan and Gobert topping the list and with the top 15 players all time attempting roughly 63% of their shots from 0-3 feet. Ayton is a significant outlier though, with only 40% of his shots attempted from that range, and the only guys who were vaguely close were Shaq and Whiteside at 50% and 49% respectively. I know that while watching games this year I've basically come to assume those little free throw line jumpers are always going in, and the stats backed that up with him shooting 61% on all twos longer than 16 feet this year.

It's hard to know at this point what the team of the future will look like, but Ayton undeniably has a unique skillset for a player at his size and position. Wouldn't hate if he could earn a few more trips to the free throw line a game but still pretty impressive stuff and a nice change of pace from watching Nurkic brick so many bunnies.",ripcity,46,https://www.reddit.com/r/ripcity/comments/1b1l3ra/an_interesting_ayton_nugget/

2024-07-20,1721489594,Does anyone else feel like our future is being a little bit underrated by people outside of Portland?,"I see a lot of people talking about teams like OKC, Houston, San Antonio, etc as teams with bright futures and I wont try to argue that nor say we are in a better spot going forward then either of them but I mean if we really look at the roster and the future draft capital we have I actually feel decent about the next 5-10 years of Blazers basketball.

Scoot and Shaedon both still have all star caliber upside, Clingan looks like a really good rim protector and thats if he doesnt figure anything else out about his game at the NBA level and then we still have young ish and exciting players that we can either hold on to or trade down the line for assets like Advija, Ant, or Ayton. 

Not to mention we likely have a high draft pick in the 2025 draft so if the lottery likes us then we could make a splash there too. Obviously Im biased and every fan says this but honestly when I try to be as unbiased about this team as possible I think were in a good spot.

Seeing this team keep pushing was super fun to watch. Recency bias makes me think a player like Nurk would have gone into a pouting cocoon after that or would have made some dumb fouls to kick them out of the game. I would have blamed the refs for the loss as well.

None of that happened and they kept pushing. So cool to see.

2024-08-28,1724844281,"""You Haven't Seen Half of Deni Yet"": The Next Step in Avdija's Development (Translated Article)","**Israeli Sport5 did a piece about Deni, thought it might be of interest to some of you, it's a bit long but interesting. Here's the translation:**

&gt;A lot has changed this summer for Deni Avdijahis team, of course, the city, the home, the routines, the friends, the coaches, the atmosphere, the arena, the fans, the weather, and basically everything he knew so well over his four years in Washington. Now, he will have to learn it all over again in Portland. But one thing, above all, has remained the same: his hunger to maximize his potential.

&gt;In the summer of 2023, Avdija worked harder than ever to bring out his true talent in the 2023/24 season, establish his status in the NBA, and justify his top 10 draft pick. After achieving a breakout season where the 23-year-old Israeli finished sixth in the race for Most Improved Player, he entered the summer of 2024 aiming to build on the momentum and take another leap towards the top.

&gt;It sounds promising, but we're here to talk specificsso what does that actually mean? To answer that, once again this year, we took a behind-the-scenes look with Avdija's coaches to hear exactly what's happening in the training sessions, what new elements have been added to his arsenal, and what to expector at least aim forin the upcoming season.

&gt;""Deni is by far the hardest-working player, theres no comparison,"" said Oded Brandwein, a former player and the director of the 'Clutch' training facility, who worked closely with Avdija this summer. ""This was true last summer as well, and this year it's even more intense. Hes hungrier and more obsessed with his work than ever. No one even comes close to him in this regard. He takes himself as seriously as possible, eats right, and maintains his body constantly, like an All-Star.""

&gt;Deni is always the first to arrive at the training facility, he continued. He had many sessions at the beach at 6 a.m. with Regev Fanan, and by 7:45 a.m., he was already starting his basketball workout. After that, he would go for treatment, and by 5 p.m., he was back for shooting practice.

&gt;Regev Fanan continued as Avdijas fitness coach, and at the start of the summer, like last year, shooting coach Adam Filippi arrived in Israel. These three main coaches worked with Avdija during the offseason (along with two staff members from Washington who came to Israel and the coaches in Portland), and each of them shared how the hard work and magic look from their perspective.

&gt;  


&gt;During last season, I did a huge video project on Deni, said Brandwein when talking about his and Avdija's preparation for this summer. I took all his offensive actions and divided them into 16-17 folders. Deni is a perfectionist and thirsty for knowledge; hes a student of the game and very easy to coach. He has an amazing attitude.

&gt;In terms of basketball, the summer of 2023 was entirely dedicated to shooting. We knew that immediate and drastic improvement was necessary, and there would be no shortcuts, he shared. We dedicated four months to shooting, and it paid off (from 29.7% from three to 37.4%). This summer, of course, we also worked on Deni's shooting; it will always be an essential part of his training. However, after the significant improvement in three-point percentage, we invested a lot of time in the 'In between areas' (the areas between the paint and the three-point line).

&gt;According to the ""InStat"" website, only 219 out of the 2273 field goals Avdija has taken in his 287 NBA games came from areas other than under the basket or outside the arc. Thats 9.6%. True, basketball is moving more towards layups and threes, and no one expects Deni to turn into DeMar DeRozan or Kevin Durant from mid-range, but he must add a dimension that diversifies his offensive game and opens up more options. Hes talented enough for that.

&gt;We worked on floaters, turnaround shots, and mid-range, and emphasized the ability to stop and shoot, so hes not just driving hard to the basket or shooting threes, Brandwein explained. We wanted Deni to know how to create plays for himself, generate separation from his defenders, stop, and rise for a jump shot. This is something the leading players in the NBA do a lot, and Deni knows he can be a leading player in this league. Players who handle the ball a lot need to be versatile in these areas. For me, this should be his next step, and I believe he has the body and skills to do it.

&gt;We expanded Deni's 'bag' (skill set); he has such a powerful first step, hes so athletic, and he has an unbelievable body. So, he needs to know how to do all these additional things. Most of the time, we worked on face-up moves, but Deni is a player who knows how to start plays facing the basket and then transition to playing with his back to it. Because hes such a versatile player, its important not to get tempted to do too much with him and to really take one or two topics and focus on them. I feel weve done that well.

&gt;So far, we havent seen a signature move from Avdija in half-court play, beyond a strong right-hand drive, and Brandwein would also like to see some updates in this area for the upcoming season: I would absolutely like Deni to have another signature move. I think his bread and butter are his right-hand drives with the shoulder and threes, but as he becomes a more central player and gets the ball more, youll realize that you havent seen 50% of what hes capable of.

&gt;Deni can do so many more things, and I have no doubt that this season we will see them at a much higher intensity. It largely depends on how Portland uses him, but he himself is ready to take his game a step forward, and as long as the ball is in his hands, the fans will see things they havent seen from him before, things Ive seen with my own eyes. Weve seen 50% of his potential so far, and hes only 23.

&gt;  


&gt;Like all of us, Avdija didnt expect to be traded and move to the other side of America this summer. You can split this summer into two partsbefore the trade and after, said Fanon. After the regular season, Deni rested for two and a half to three weeks, then started training in Israel with full communication between us and Washington. Our relationship had already deepened, and I knew what they demanded. In any case, the goals remained the same: improve mobility, hip work, stability, and how he holds his body. Of course, we always focus on strength and athletic ability with him.

&gt;Brandwein reflected on the training atmosphere after the trade: Theres no doubt that in the days following, I saw an element of surprise in Deni. The day after the trade, he was already in training; he didnt take any time off and immediately switched to business mode, understanding that his success depends solely on him. Deni also understood that the Trail Blazers gave up quite a bit for him, so hes coming to a place where hes wanted and has growth potential.

&gt;This year, we did more outdoor training, which was very important to Deni, Fanon continued. I also wanted to take him a bit off the basketball court because of the mental aspect and because its a different kind of work that adds elements to athletic ability that are hard to develop on the court. Working without the basketball allows for a focus on small details. We did very early workouts; they give Deni peace, and hes different during those hours.

&gt;There were Wizards staff members here in Israel, even on the night of the trade, Fanon shared. They wanted to see exactly what was going on with him, and then suddenly everything changed. No one had any idea. After that, Deni flew to Portland and trained there for a few days. He has an excellent strength coach with the Blazers, and I passed on what he needed to know, both personally and physically. The focus points didnt change when he switched teams, but every system works a little differently.

&gt;In the last three seasons, Avdija played in 233 out of the Wizards 246 games, an impressive stat that didnt leave Fanon indifferent: Credit first goes to Deni, and then to his system in the NBA; their load management is very well done. In the EuroLeague, for example, we burden players more because the weight of each game is greater. Deni isnt the type to take it easy on himself; hes tough and knows how to play through pain. Its very important to him to play. He brings European culture to the NBA and takes excellent care of himself. The fact that he trains hard doesnt necessarily expose him to injuries; he plays at very high intensity 95% of the time, sometimes too much. In this aspect, kudos to Washington for teaching him to occasionally ease off the gas and take care of himself.

&gt;In basketball, theres a lot of work on acceleration and deceleration, he said as he delved into the fitness training he did with Avdija this summer. Sometimes people think that speed is all that matters, but all the really good players who want to create space from their defenders and better control their bodies need to have good deceleration, too. This year, we put more emphasis on slowing down. That means not just jumping but also knowing how to land, not just sprinting but also stopping quickly and changing direction. Many players dont know how to do this, and these things are also crucial for health. This work reflects in Denis basketball and improves him.

&gt;There are specific exercises that work on deceleration, Fanon added. The basic exercises in the weight room are concentric work, which focuses on muscle shortening, but here the emphasis is on eccentric work, which is about muscle lengtheningteaching the muscle to work while stretching. Typically, people in the gym focus on concentric work, but with players, we want to work on the opposite action as well to give them better control over their bodies.

&gt;What has changed since the move to Portland? A different style of training has been added to Avdijas routinePilates. The Blazers' strength coach is unconventional and loves Pilates work. As soon as we saw that Portland emphasizes this, we found Deni a Pilates trainer in Israel who helps him in this area. He does Pilates with machines more than once a week and really connects with it. We believe this will help him transition even more smoothly into the Portland system if thats what theyre looking for. Pilates works more on internal muscles, stabilizers, core, shoulder girdle, and range of motion. Many basketball players do it. Additionally, Deni has a personal physiotherapist named Tamir Chen who works with him twice a week. These trainers dive into details that we strength coaches dont reach.

&gt;

&gt;Philippe also spoke about working with Avdija during this offseason, but not before describing the rapid progress the Israeli made from being one of the least efficient shooters in the NBA to shooting nearly 40% from three for most of last season: Last summer, our main goal was to synchronize Denis legs and arms during his shot, so it would flow better. His percentages can go up or down, that's less important to me; now defenses are already taking him seriously. The main thing is that he catches the ball with the intention to shoot whenever he's open, and that his body language shows he's ready to shoot even after a few misses.

&gt;Its not easy to accept your mistakes when youre a young player, the senior coach explained, but those mistakes are critical for growth. Deni's approach is more important to me than his percentages. Most of the time last year, he was around 39% from three, and this season I expect him to take more shots.

&gt;Ive never met a player who absorbs what he's taught as quickly as Deni, he admitted. This kid makes hard things look easy. Sometimes he does things in practice that amaze me. What takes another player 2-3 months to learn takes Deni 5 minutes. I love teaching him a move or drill and letting him add his own twist without limiting his creativity. Last summer, we focused more on the mechanical side, and this year, we added creative elements with movement and dribbling. We worked on mid-range shots and moves around the free-throw lineand this new dimension will help the Blazers. Deni is a special player.

&gt;In 2001-02, the Los Angeles Lakers appointed Philippe as the head of their international scouting department, a role he held until 2010-11, being part of three of the clubs championships. One of the Lakers' stars at the end of that decade, Lamar Odom, helped Kobe Bryant win his last two championships (2009 and 2010), and Philippe sees similarities between him and Avdija: Id like to think that Deni can develop into a point-forward/playmaker in the style of Odom, he said. Hes one of the best players in the NBA at grabbing a rebound and leading a fast break. Deni has reached 50% of his potential, and I couldnt be prouder of his development. His mentality has improved so much since last summer, and I credit his desire to improve, as well as Regev Fanon and the rest of his support system.

&gt;Interestingly, Avdijas percentages improved last season by 6.9% from the field and 7.7% from three, but only by 0.1% from the free-throw line (1.7% below his career-high in 2021-22), and Philippe was not fully satisfied with this: Deni's free-throw shooting intrigued me because he didnt show improvement despite having excellent technique. Hes still learning the mental aspect of free-throwshow to ignore misses. Recently, he made 98 out of 100 free-throws in practice, and during our 10 days in Miami this summer, he shot 91%. Both are personal bests since I started working with him 18 months ago.

&gt;

&gt;Each of the three coaches was asked what they would like to see from Avdija this season, and these are the goals set by the people who know him best in the training lab:

&gt;**Brandwein:** There are a few things that would make me happy this season, and the first is to see Deni with the ball in his hands more often. He needs to make decisions, read defenses well, and play more pick-and-roll. I want him to respond better to all the defensive coverages hell encounter. Id be very happy to see him take more mid-range shots and create more shots for himself. He should stick to at least 10 shots per game, get to around 40% from three, improve his free-throw percentage (74% last season), and get to the line more often. Every statistical category needs to improve, including usage rate. All of this will determine his status as a dominant player in the league. I want to see a more versatile and complete player in his gamethen Ill know hes on the right path.

&gt;In terms of his potential, Deni can be an All-Star in two to three years; the upcoming season will be very significant. As far as what depends on him, hes fully committed, goal-oriented, works very hard, knows his worth, and his peak is still ahead. Most Improved Player of the Year? We havent talked about it, but I know that deep down, Deni feels he can absolutely be an All-Star later in his career. I know he believes in it and isnt shy to think and say it. I dont think he expects it to happen this year, but those are his aspirations. Thats where hes directing his entire approach.

&gt;**Fanon:** First and foremost, I want to see Deni stay healthy this season. If youve worked with a player and they end up injured, then its not it. Of course, its fine to miss a game here or there. He needs to continue running the floor the way he does. One of the most impressive things about him is his ability, as a big guy with all his muscle mass, to run the floor so efficiently. It looks very powerful, and Id love to see him do it with even more confidence.

&gt;Theres always an emphasis on his lateral work on defense; he defends at a very high level, and he needs to further improve and refine his lateral movement and that explosive first step that allows him to stop guards. I want Deni to really be a wall between his player and the basket, so that its known if hes guarding a playerthey cant get past him, not with the first step, not with a fancy crossover. In my eyes, Deni has All-Star defensive potential.

&gt;**Philippe:** Id be very happy for Deni to bring to the table the mid-range game we worked on and his three-point shooting off the dribble. We worked a lot on side-steps in the corners after defenders close out on him, and hes shown great improvement. As I said, I want to see him shoot more, even at the expense of a drop in percentages. Deni is a star.

&gt;In 2023/24, Avdija made a name for himself as a top 100 player in the NBA, with one of the most team-friendly contracts in the league, capable of easily upgrading any team. If in 2024/25 he replicates the same level of improvementrest assured, it wont just be his coaches saying hes a star, but the whole world.

2024-01-24,1706119643,Think we are overlooking Scoot best game of his career!,"I was sick to my stomach watching us lose that game the way we did. I was going to be happy if we lost by less than 25 with the way we have been matching up vs OKC. But we fought all night and I thought there were real positives to take away. Jabari Walker has been a beast and I truly think we just saw Scoot best game of his career.

I have been lower on Scoot then probably anyone, but I was truly blown away by how good he looked vs the best team in the West this year. I thought he had one of his best passing games where he didn't have any excruciating turnovers and instead found shooters and created a ton of looks with his drives. Some of his passes to Jabari were incredible, those are the type of passes I have been begging to see from Scoot. The Scoot/Brog/Jabari/Reath combination is just so smooth and displays high level of smart hoop when Scoot is clicking. I think the play we see from that group is what we should be striving for as a rebuilding team. The first unit plays much simpler, which is sad because there is a lot of talent there but we pretty much resort to only flattened PnR play. 

What impressed me the most about Scoot game was how he finished in the paint. I was always so frustrated with Scoot finishing because he always looked like he was trying to quickly beat everyone to the rim and try to sneaky-finesse-finish a layup and he always lacked the touch OR got blocked. However, last night was one of the rare times where Scoot realized he is so damn strong that people will BOUNCE off of him. He got into the paint and absorbed contact and finished through guys! Even if he doesn't always finish those looks, he will at least earn more free throws and that will be great for him. 

I thought we ran some way better sets to get Scoot going downhill which is better than watching him try to attack a set defense flat footed. Plus, Scoot was pushing the pace a ton and was really decisive in his drives and was able to make reads on the defensive coverage. It helps that OKC plays smaller with Chet being the only big. 

I have always thought that Simons is be the future at the PG spot. But, last night showed what Scoot needs to do in order to take over the starting PG spot by outplaying Simons for most of the night in my opinion. Obviously Scoot is going to be up and down, but if he keeps having shifts like he did vs OKC, he is really going to prove why he was so highly profiled coming out of the Ignite.

2024-04-14,1713112415,"Understanding how the NBA draft lottery works, AKA how today will affect our pick odds","I've seen some confusion recently regarding how the odds will work if we tie with one or both of the Spurs or Hornets, so I decided to do a quick rundown to address how it works:

**The Process**

First off, it's important to understand how the NBA gives odds to each team. As you probably know, numbered ping pong balls are drawn to determine picks. How these work, however, is a little complicated. First of all, the only real ""lottery"" is for the first four picks, after these are drawn, the rest of the picks are assigned based on record, from worst to best, with a coin flip breaking ties. There are 14 ping pong balls in total, each numbered 1-14. When determining pick order for the first four picks, four balls are drawn, and each team ""owns"" a certain number of the combinations for the numbers on these four balls. There are 1001 possible combinations in total, and one is thrown out to make the number an even 1000. Here is a list of how many combinations each team owns based on record:

* 1 (worst record): 140 combinations, 14.0% chance of receiving the No. 1 pick

* 2: 140 combinations, 14.0% chance

* 3: 140 combinations, 14.0% chance

* 4: 125 combinations, 12.5% chance

* 5: 105 combinations, 10.5% chance

* 6: 90 combinations, 9.0% chance

* 7: 75 combinations, 7.5% chance

* 8: 60 combinations, 6.0% chance

* 9: 45 combinations, 4.5% chance

* 10: 30 combinations, 3.0% chance

* 11: 20 combinations, 2.0% chance

* 12: 15 combinations, 1.5% chance

* 13: 10 combinations, 1.0% chance

* 14: 5 combinations, 0.5% chance

So, obviously, the more combinations you have, the better your chances of getting a top pick. That much is usually evident to most people. However, what happens if two (or three or more!) teams end up tied in the standings? 

**Lottery Tiebreak Rules**

In the event of a tie, the number of combinations are added together and then divided evenly between the tied teams (aka averaged). However, this doesn't always result in a clean split. If the average isn't an integer (a whole number), a coin flip is used to determine which team gets the final combination. If there are three+ teams tied, the coin flip becomes a little more complicated. Each team flips their own coin until one team has a result that differs from the other two, thus winning and claiming the final combination. 

^^I ^^couldn't ^^verify ^^that ^^the ^^NBA ^^actually ^^uses ^^the ^^three ^^team ^^flip ^^method ^^specifically, ^^but ^^I'm ^^certain ^^they ^^do ^^something ^^equivalent. 

**How This Affects the Blazers' Shot At Pick #1**

* If we end up winning today and SAS loses, we get the 5th worst record, thus getting 105 ping pong ball combinations, which is a 10.5% chance at the 1st pick. 

* If we win and SAS wins, we tie with SAS for the 4th worst record, thus getting 115 ping pong ball combinations, which is a 11.5% chance at the 1st pick.  

* If we lose, SAS wins, and CHA loses, we get the 4th worst record, thus getting 125 ping pong ball combinations, which is a 12.5% chance at the 1st pick. 

* If we lose, SAS loses, and CHA loses, we tie with SAS for the 4th worst record, thus getting 115 ping pong ball combinations, which is a 11.5% chance at the 1st pick. 

* If we lose, SAS loses, and CHA wins, we tie with SAS AND CHA for the 3rd worst record, thus getting at least 123 ping pong ball combinations and potentially 124 if we win the 3 way coin flip, which is a 12.3% or 12.4% chance at the 1st pick. 

* If we lose, SAS wins, and CHA wins, we tie with CHA for the 3rd worst record, thus getting at least 132 ping pong ball combinations and potentially 133 if we win the coin flip, which is a 13.2% or 13.3% chance at the 1st pick. 

**Conclusion**

It's easy to look at 1 or 2% changes to our chances and thinking it won't matter at all, but it's important to keep in mind that our number of pick combinations affect not only our chances to get pick one, but also picks 2-4, and can affect how far our pick can fall. Our ""best case"" scenario of tying for third with CHA will boost our odds of getting a top for pick by about 8% vs our ""worst case"" scenario of getting the 5th odds, which is a pretty big swing for a single day of games. Additionally, with a tie for third and a coin flip win, our pick can only fall to 7, however with the 5th best odds, it could fall all the way to 9th. Overall, this year has been pretty brutal, and it'd be nice to get a good pick in the draft at the end of it. Hope this helps alleviate some confusion, and go Blazers! 

TL;DR: There are 1000 ways the ping pong balls can fall, worse teams get more chances at getting the 1st overall pick. If teams are tied, their chances are averaged. If we lose vs the Kings, our pick will be a little better.",ripcity,29,https://www.reddit.com/r/ripcity/comments/1c3xo0z/understanding_how_the_nba_draft_lottery_works_aka/
2024-03-31,1711922955,A message to anyone feeling down about this rebuild so far ,"1 . This is not a normal rebuild. The franchise (IMO) was never gonna trade dame until he asked out. They probably wanted him to ask out two summers ago but instead just started rebuilding while he was still around. 

2. Because of this, Portland wasnt really able to embrace a FULL REBUILD. (See OKC and HOU). It hasnt been organic. Its been clumsy. 

3. Dame was traded a week before camp. Again: clumsy. Our whole roster was overhauled 2 weeks before games began. 

4. We re-signed Jerami (in order to flip him for assets on a later date because the alternative was lose him for nothing) and same with Tisse. And we traded for Brogdon and Time Lord for the same reasons. Weird to see a young team with really strong vets who could help contenders. Now theyre being shut down so they dont get hurt before he can trade them in July.  

5. Remember how atrocious the rockets were the last two seasons? People were saying the same thing about them that theyre saying now about the blazers. And the rockets have really turned a corner. It takes time.

6. Last one. Despite all of this, i thought this year had a lot of encouraging moments. We found rotational guys in Tounami, Kris, Banton, and Duop. A future stud in Rups. Were getting a long look at whatever Scoot is. Which will help when the FO has to make a decision about Ant or him down the line. Also: Chauncey is heading into year 4, which makes it easier to fire him.

And now were about to enter the offseason with two lotto picks probably, bunch of cap space, a direction, and a few juicy future assets from Boston and Milwaukee.

Been a challenging season but the franchise feels healthier than it has the last few years. 

What do you think? 

Go Blazers.

2024-07-14,1720935818,Donovan Clingan Game 1 Takes,"The Good: 

Rebounding: Hes 73 and it shows. Honestly, grabbing 10 boards a game for him shouldnt be a problem even in just 20-25 minutes of playing time, particularly on the defensive glass. A couple of times, he was out of position and allowed himself to be knocked off his spot by a smaller but more athletic big. 

Interior Defense: Apart from his 5 blocks which was great to see, I saw multiple times when opposing players didnt look towards the basket when they got inside the paint. His shot deterrence will be arguably more valuable than his shot blocking. He also demonstrated an excellent ability to remain vertical and contest without fouling, frankly the most difficult thing for a young center to do. Guards in the NBA are athletic, strong, crafty and are always trying to create contact. Just having his body there in the paint was enough to cause misses and lead to turnovers. 

Screening: He seems to have an excellent ability to set solid screens, which will be great for freeing up shooters. I think he needs to do a better job of rolling hard to the rim. I think as he got more fatigued, his rolls were less direct or he just popped (which you cant do if you cant shoot) and he was easily pushed off his path. But the skill is there. 

The Needs Improvement:

Interior scoring: He showed a nice hook shot on one possession where the Spurs didnt rush a double and played him straight up, which was encouraging. However a couple times he had some close shots in the paint, either short jumpers or push shots, that he was way off on. He needs to develop and efficient offensive game in the 6-10 foot range. Granted, the majority of his looks will be right at the rim on hooks, dunks, or lobs, but being able to consistently hit that push shot will open things up for him and his teammates. It was clear that this summer league team doesnt have the highest quality passers, many lobs were miss thrown or easily sniffed out so we didnt really get a good read of his lob threat. This adds to my frustration with the decision to not have Scoot play in Summer League. I think Scoot has shown promise as an excellent passer and it would have been great to see a connection develop with Clingan. 

Shooting: No more threes. Lets worry about adding that next offseason lol. Im sure he was hitting them in practice, but the speed of the game tired him out quickly and he came up well short. Id work on the short game first before worrying about becoming an outside shooter.

Conditioning: This will naturally improve with each game, but he got gassed very quickly. I even saw him ask to be subbed out because he was so gassed. Hell need to get in much better shape before the regular season starts. Not really concerned about this, he hasnt played live games in a while and this was expected. 

Passing: I was hoping to see more of his ability to pass the ball from the top of the key, but I dont think he was put in too many positions to demonstrate this ability. That might have been for the best, this being his first game. I hope he does get the opportunity to show his ability to hit cutters and make backdoor passes. 


All in all, a promising first step in his journey. No red flags in his game. Excited to see him build on this performance.

Pressure: Clingan excels in exactly the areas Ayton lacks: doing all the little things, screening, hustling, passing. Seeing a dude coming for your job who's doing all the things coaches have been hounding Ayton to do for years seems like a great way to motivate him.

Negotiation: We all know the ""got nothing to prove"" line. Ayton will want a max contract extension in 2 years and having another starter-quality center on the books is great for Cronin to not feel pressured to pay up.

2024-06-29,1719636826,Understanding the Deni trade (from an outsiders perspective) 4d chess moveone of the best trade assets in the league BY far.,"When I first saw the trade I was very surprised. Anyone calling it a robbery (for either side) is crazy. 

I see a few different narratives going around. Wizards didnt see him at part of the core in the future or wrong timeline. 

Portland thinks there is a lot of upside still and is a clear part of the future. 

  
One thing I havent seen mentioned, that could be a part of the finality of the trade is that Portland traded for him not as a core piece but as one of the very best assets in the league. His contract is descending and last year will be making like 12 m or something. 

Alex Caruso was garnering multiple 1st round picks + young player and while he is a better defender. Deni does so much more offensively while ALSO being a very good defender, and elite rebounder for his position. He is almost a prototypical forward for any contender. I could see OKC significantly overpaying for him in a trade where you guys get a shit load of draft capital. I honestly dont think Mikal Bridges is that much better of a player, when you consider the contract I would take Deni personally. 

Either way I would be stoked about the trade, I think you won the trade already. There is a really high probability that Deni is put in a role to feature his skills and either 

1) plays himself into ""untouchable"" status to your FO (although not a true one  lol) 

or

2) puts up (borderline) all star numbers and is coveted HIGHLY by multiple contenders. Showcases his defensive versatility against the best of the west's wings / forwards. Showcases his offensive versatility. He is one of the best off ball players in the league. Not in the mold of steph but as a cutter and play finisher he shows elite feel for the game. High effort player, elite rebounder, good passer. Every team needs a player like that. Add in that he is a good 3pt shooter (even if he regressed and shot 35% that wouldnt affect his market IMO at all) and he is 6'9?!? 

  
Seriously this could look like a chess/checkers move. I think that Washington will regret this before you will. 

  
Even if you keep him his contract is top 10 for value and with its descending rate, and will be the best in the league (until Wemby extends)

Anyways just thought id share my thoughts, great trade for you guys

2023-12-17,1702827072,Film study: how Ant's scoring gravity generates wide open shots for teammates (and how Ant makes this offense better).,"[**TL;DR:** From last night alone, I compiled 16 possessions where Simons scoring gravity led to wide open shots by teammates \(these largely wont show up in the stat sheet, as Simons only got 2 or 3 assists from these\). When watching, look at the insane amount of defensive attention Simons commands when coming off a screen, and how far the defense bends. In case you dont want to read and just want to watch the video, here is a link.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yaWhA3o61ds) 

Last night, I saw a lot of takes saying things like Ant is only a pure scorer, Ant doesnt generate good shots for his teammates, and the offense stagnates with Ant.

Statistically, this doesnt seem to be the case, as in the very limited minutes Ant has played so far, the offense has scored 111.27 points per 100 possessions, the third highest number on the team for any rotation player (Reath and Walker are the two highest). I understand that ORTG doesnt tell the entire story, but the film backs it up. 

Simons is obviously a lethal shooter off the ball, but hes also a very good PnR player. Last season, he produced 1.01 PPP as the PnR ballhandler, good for 82nd percentile. The season before that, he produced 1.03 PPP, good for the 88th percentile. Teams have learned that Simons cant really come cleanly off a pick, or else he will pull up from three, which is generally bad for the defense. Instead they have resorted to blitzing or showing on PnRs, which leaves teammates wide open.


Here is every play in a streamable form, since YouTube has been weird with compilations in the past (I had a video taken down for a copyright violation so idk if the YouTube video will stay up). 

* [Play 1](https://streamable.com/jmm7j6): Ant comes off the screen by Ayton (side note: Ayton is a truly horrible screensetter - he just makes no effort whatsoever to make contact with the defender) and attracts 2.5 Mavs defenders. Because two defenders have committed to Ant, Exum is guarding both Sharpe and Grant so he has to make a long closeout, so Sharpe attacks and dumps it off to Ayton for a dunk. [Have a look at this screenshot for a better illustration of how much the Mavs defense has distorted here, and you can see Exum guarding two people while Ant draws 2 and a half defenders](https://imgur.com/a/YVOslrj).

* [Play 2](https://streamable.com/egvmor): Ant comes off another Ayton screen and Lively takes a bad angle, leading to dribble penetration and a wide open three, as Luka has to leave the corner to stop the drive. Its worth noting that even if Ant wasnt able to turn the corner on Lively immediately, the three would still have been open because Luka would have had to leave the corner to tag Ayton on the roll, since Lively was showing on the initial screen action.
* [Play 3](https://streamable.com/c6l07j): Lively is playing at the level of the screen so Grant Williams has to rotate off the corner to stop the rolling Ayton, leaving Grant wide open in the corner for three. [Here you can see what the defense looks like before the trap,](https://imgur.com/a/Ky7fJsY) and once Ant has gotten rid of the ball you can see where the rotations come from, and [how the three was generated](https://imgur.com/a/CNubiiw).

* [Play 4](https://streamable.com/cc3dzm) no explanation needed for this one


* [Play 5](https://streamable.com/qf868y): no explanation needed again really (although Ayton sets a real screen this time, yay!). Camara makes a bad cut that messes up the spacing, but Ayton is still able to get downhill and generates 2 FTs.

* [Play 6](https://streamable.com/qgedgr): This is what happens when the big doesn't play high enough and lets Ant pull up for three.

* [Play 7](https://streamable.com/sxoua3) Great screen by Reath that takes Exum out of the play, which means Williams has to come over to stop the drive, making him late stopping the roll. Because he is late, he gets pumpfaked off his feet, but Reath misses a wide open layup.

* [Play 8](https://streamable.com/0u2et8)  Reath slips the screen when he feels the trap, and it's 2v1 with Reath and Camara at the rim against Luka. 

* [Play 9](https://streamable.com/xs6c39) Luka is sitting in the passing lane to Reath, who is the outlet man (Ant doesn't have the angle to throw the skip pass to Sharpe). In this case Reath needs to cut to the basket but doesn't. However Sharpe sees that Reath isn't moving and cuts himself, leading to an and one. 

* [Play 10](https://streamable.com/j25dyv) self explanatory 

* [Play 11](https://streamable.com/sv4my9) Ant breaks the trap and turns the corner and the defense breaks down. Hardaway has to leave the corner to stop the dribble penetration and Brogdon passes up a wide open three (great play by Hardy too to break up the pass).

* [Play 12](https://streamable.com/64iz5f) Bad communication between Sharpe and Brogdon (when Sharpe fades to the corner Brogdon needs to move to the wing) he recognizes this a second late. Also Ayton makes the wrong read here and needs to throw the ball to the side with a 2v1 advantage. If the spacing here is correct and Ayton makes the right read, then Sharpe and Brogdon get to play with a 2v1 advantage on the weakside and someone is getting an open shot....

* [Play 13](https://streamable.com/gcemg7) The spacing is correct this time, Ayton makes the right read, and it's a wide open three.

* [Play 14](https://streamable.com/ev4ing) perfect execution. Reath recognizes the trap, slips, and Camara cuts, and it's a layup

* [Play 15](https://streamable.com/kefyf9) Pretty self explanatory here. Exum has to tag Ayton on the roll leaving Sharpe in the corner wide open. 

* [Play 16](https://streamable.com/usx9xj) Ayton gets an open 15-footer. I don't personally love the shot, but Ayton himself loves the shot and he's good at making them, so I can't really complain too much here.

* [Play 17](https://streamable.com/irh8lc) Ayton doesn't recognize the trap (normally when the guard is trapped you have to position yourself as a release valve, but Ayton runs away from the play and inexplicably runs into the paint for some reason???) but Ant is able to throw the cross court pass to Sharpe anyways. Hardaway is in the paint guarding Ayton (it was his job to stop Ayton in the short roll out of the trap if Ayton had gotten the ball) so he is forced into a long closeout and gets pump faked out of his shoes resulting in a wide open shot. 


___________

All in all here we can see how Ant's scoring gravity is basically commanding two defenders off a screen, and is generating lots of open shots for his teammates. Also, in all of these plays, he himself only got three assists, but he was really good generating wide open shots for his teammates all game long, in addition to his own scoring (33 points on 68% TS is pretty damn good).

FOR THE RECORD before people come at me, I AM NOT SAYING ANT IS THE PG OF THE FUTURE or that we should keep running 3 guard lineups or anything like that. But, with Scoot being raw, Ant makes this offense better in the present and is getting guys open looks, which is a good thing especially on a team that really struggles to generate offense at times).",ripcity,24,https://www.reddit.com/r/ripcity/comments/18kjrr1/film_study_how_ants_scoring_gravity_generates/

2024-05-25,1716660180,Zach Edey shows off Jokic-style rainbow hitting six consecutive 3s at the combine,"Fun fact: Zach Edey averaged 46.2 points, 22.3 boards, 3.9 blocks, and 20.5 free throw attempts (14.6 made) per 100 possessions last season, each significantly higher than the previous best prospect to post similar stats in the NCAA (former #1 pick Zion Williamson had 41.2 points, 3.3 blocks, 16.2 rebounds, and 11.2 free throw attempts with 7.2 makes per 100 pssns.). (An average NBA game has 100 possessions.) 

Also, Edey's 10.5 win shares last season ranks #5 since 1974-75. The 12 other players who had at least 9.9 win shares in an NCAA season:

- all were drafted and started at least 194 NBA games 
- 75% started more than 600 games started)
- 33% were drafted #1 (Bogut, Duncan, Brand, AD)
- only 2 were drafted below #7 (Paul Millsap, the steal of his draft, and John Collins, also a steal)
- 50% won at least one NBA title
- 66% were all-stars
- 2 were 2x league MVPs (Curry &amp; Duncan)
- 2 were Finals MVPs (Curry &amp; Duncan)

Of all of those players, Edey posted the most offensive win shares and the most total points in a 9.9+ win shares season. 

Welcome, haters! I have a standing offer: I'll bet $1000 that Edey won't be the first player on that list not to become an NBA starter; $666 he becomes an All-Star; and $500 he wins an NBA title.

In his latest interview for the Israeli network sport5, Deni(still as a wizard) talked about his growing confidence and aspirations for the coming years:
I can tell you that at the right time, at the right age with the necessary confidence and experience, i could come close to being a head of the lions(referring to an Israeli expression)

When asked about the wizards hierarchy next season, Deni also mentioned he thinks he is at the top.
I used to be afraid of failure, and thats why i was afraid to dare. Today Im in a totally different place.

Just some excerpts from Denis interview in hebrew which was shot about a month ago, and came out three days ago. 

Translating the whole interview is a bit much for me rn but thats the jist of it, worth noting it seems like Denis manager also thought Deni was a corner stone for the wizards rebuild, but he did mention its possible for Deni to be traded for the right price.

Lillard made it out of the first round 3 times, Garnett made it 1 time.

Garnett got his title with Boston. I'm hoping Lillard can get his as well. Garnett then came back in basically a tribute season to the TWolves and retired as one. Hoping Lillard can do that too.

2024-02-18,1708267424,Venting about Portlands WNBA fiasco,"I can't be the only one still mad about this. Watching the all star festivities with the WNBA involved made me post this.

Everything lined up for us to get a team, San Fran getting a team in October with us basically unofficially named (later revealed they had a whole press release ready and Nike had a presentation too) and then November 1st arrives and ""sorry WNBA isn't coming for a while now""

Official reason given is that the Moda Center needs to get repairs over two years in the summer and that would coincide with the WNBA season and Portland couldn't play while repairs were happening.

Why did nobody call this bullshit excuse out? 

1. There is no way you get to the point of having a press release/Nike mock ups and then somehow realize the place they were gonna play is having roof repairs during the season.

2. If that really is the case, the WHL season DOES NOT overlap with the WNBA season at all. Why couldn't the WNBA team play at Veterans for their first two seasons then move over when renovations are done?


I am just surprised there hasn't been any articles following this up. I love Portland. I love Oregon. I love that women's sports has taken off the last few years.  That Oregon State game winner the other day was awesome. This town and state would absolutely embrace a team here. Imagine WNBA debauchery and we somehow land Sabrina.

2024-02-03,1706920110,"In a rebuild season, this is the most fun I've had watching the Blazers in a while.","I'm an Australian Blazers fan, who started following the team in Dame's rookie year. I even flew to Portland a few years ago just to watch the team play. 

Over the pandemic I lost interest - stopped watching, and only checked in every few weeks. It was just the same story, frustrating losses with ""almost"" years.

But this team, now, is fun.

Seeing that Duop was ripping it up has brought me back, and I'm back in love. There's something about an underdog, and I think watching them win Lillard's return game (pretending I was working) is one of my all-time basketball moments.

Shaedon, Camara and Tisse are great to watch, and seeing Ant and Scoot evolve with every game is really rewarding. 

I can understand fans not enjoying a losing season, but it's been a long time since I've felt this connected and invested in the team. It's nice to be back!",ripcity,17,https://www.reddit.com/r/ripcity/comments/1ahix3k/in_a_rebuild_season_this_is_the_most_fun_ive_had/

2024-02-03,1707001159,"We must stop the ""small guard"" slander of scoot.","Much like the ""Scoot isn't athletic"" slander,  some hack of an ""analyst"" wrote that Scoot Henderson is short and therefore limited.

The Average height of a pg in the NBA is 6'2.5"" (https://www.casino.org/blog/average-nba-player-height/), which is roughly Scoots height (officially 6'3"" post draft and 6'2"" before draft).  So is Scoot average size for a PG?

NO! Scoot is large for a pg, not just in muscles but both height and wingspan.  You might be wondering why I say Scoot is tall for a PG in the same paragraph where I say he's equal to average.  In 2019-2020 the NBA changed it's measurements rules to be barefoot only.  However most aggregates for player data typically use draft data, or it simply isn't updated (see Lillard who measured 6'1"" for the 2020 season yet is still listed as 6'2"" on most sites).  Scoot being 6'3"" barefoot puts him in the historical category of 6'4"" in shoes, which is big.

But Scoots height isn't all that's big.  He rocks a 6'9"" wingspan.  That is the exact wingspan of Anthony Edwards.  That is a larger wingspan than Lillard, Morant, Westbrook, DRose, Chris Paul, Fox, Trae, Curry, Irving Maxey, Jamal Murray. By a few inches for all those I listed too. Infact, his wingspan is so big for a pg it's up there with other big Pgs like Lamelo Ball and Shai Gilgeous-alexander. His wingspan is so big it's closer to average for SGs and SFs than it is for PGs.  Henderson's wingspan is 6"" longer than Herros, comparatively making him look like a T-Rex.

I like Ware -- but I don't think we have a use for Terry, and I think there would need to be at least a additional frp thrown in for it to be considered. But it would be funny if a Miami trade materialized.

2024-04-16,1713303401,A comment from Thybulle about Coach Billups from the exit interviews,"Reporter: *What's Chauncey like as a teacher?*   


Thybulle: *""He has a presence that I'm sure we've all felt. And I think as a player, when he would take the time to stop a practice or stop a shootaround and direct us or teach something, it was felt across the board. It was like those moments where everyone can breathe and feel grounded again. And I don't know how to really quantify that or put it into words, but he has an ability to create understanding for players across the board. Because we had a unique roster where we have a guy who's played 10 seasons and we have multiple guys who can't even buy alcohol. And being able to explain something in a way that everyone across that spectrum can grasp it and then apply it, I think it just speaks a lot to his ability to do that, because it's not easy. It's really easy to talk big picture, high-level things -- especially for him because he's done it and lived it. But the real challenge comes from being able to explain the simple stuff. And in my experience he's done one of the best jobs of doing that.""*  



I don't think that Billups is an elite level coach. But all of the players seem to respect and admire him. And despite being a 60-loss team, the locker room never turned sour. Guys played hard and put in the effort all season long. And while Billups' X's and O's might seem ineffective on offense, there is a lot to be said for the development of all the young players. Among them, who didn't show serious growth from the start of the season to the end? Scoot, Jabari, Rupert, and Camara all made tremendous strides.  


I just think we should be careful with so many fans calling for Chauncey to be fired. No coach would've gotten this roster to the playoffs this season. But a lot of coaches might have lost the locker room. Things might look bad now, because were not a highly talented team and we lack a true go-to player. But we are a young team, full of guys who buy-in to what Chauncey is teaching. Don't assume that whoever we could replace Billups with would automatically be better.

&gt; When the call was over, there was a list of five or six teams. Portland was made aware, and the bidding commenced. Several teams armed with draft pick assets that would've been attractive to the Blazers called only to be told they weren't on the list.

&gt;This included the Pacers and the New York Knicks, teams that later made big in-season trades and had long playoff runs. But the Blazers stuck to Holiday's list.

It sounds like Cronin did even not entertain offers for teams not on Jrue's list. He potentially could have been able to get more in return, but he stuck to only Jrue's list of teams.

The most relevant quote: 

&gt; ...he was the most disappointing player I saw in L.A. this summer. Despite his unreal athleticism, Henderson is a horrendous defensive player who cant shoot and cant finish at the rim. Hes nowhere near ready to help the Blazers win possessions. If he commits to, and succeeds in, improving his overall game, he can make a big jump playing alongside guys who know how. But there needs to be some movement towards the light. If Scoot hasnt started making real progress by February, its a five-alarm fire. No team gets too far with a negative player starting at point guard.

Pretty brutal.  Very worrying to hear about the rim stuff.  You can have a bad shooting day but doesn't sound like he's progressing on the stuff he needs to progress on.

The family, which owns the NWSL's Portland Thorns, will announce on Sept. 10 that women's professional basketball is returning to Portland in 2026.

Sean Highkin

The second time looks to be the charm for the effort to bring womens professional basketball back to Portland.

After a previously planned WNBA expansion team fell through just before the finish line last fall, Portland is closing in on finally landing a team that will begin playing in 2026, according to multiple sources with knowledge of the plans. The Bhathal family, owners of the NWSLs Portland Thorns, will lead the ownership group for the new team, sources say.

An official announcement from the Bhathals and the WNBA is expected on Sept. 10, sources say, with the teams name and logo to be unveiled at a later date. It is unknown at this point whether they plan to revive Portlands previous short-lived WNBA franchise, the Fire, which folded in 2002, or go with a different name.

Last fall, Portland was set to get an expansion team that would begin playing in 2025 and be owned by ZoomInfo cofounder Kirk Brown. It was close enough to official that a date was set last October for a press conference to announce it. Browns group bailed on the effort at the last minute, and WNBA commissioner Cathy Engelbert publicly blamed the Trail Blazers planned renovations to the Moda Center for the plans falling apart, reasoning she later walked back.

The months after the WNBAs original plans to add a team in Portland fell through coincided with the Bhathals finalizing plans to buy the Thorns from Merritt Paulson for $63 million. That sale closed in January of this year and since then, Lisa Bhathal Merage and her brother, Alex Bhathal, have been running day-to-day operations for the Thorns. Their father, Raj, is the principal co-owner of the Sacramento Kings and serves as majority owner Vivek Ranadives alternate on the NBAs board of governors.

Since buying the Thorns, the Bhathals have familiarized themselves with the Portland market and fanbase, particularly its strong support for womens sports. For several months, theyve been seriously exploring the idea of making a bid to revive the WNBA expansion efforts. They appear on the verge of making that a reality.

Alex Bhathal declined to comment when reached by direct message on Friday. The WNBA league office did not respond to an email requesting comment.

Upgrade to paid

Another group headed by the private equity firm Monarch Collective, with investments from celebrities with local ties including Damian Lillard, had also been working on a bid for a Portland WNBA expansion team. But sources involved in the process say the Bhathals had a significant edge from the beginning due to their pre-existing relationship with the NBA, which spans over 10 years that theyve been part of the Kings ownership group. The league has already fully vetted their finances, which would expedite the approval process significantly compared to the other group, and prevent any last-minute snags like what happened with Browns group last fall.

The imminent addition of a Portland team comes as part of an ambitious expansion plan for the WNBA amid the recent explosion of mainstream popularity for womens basketball at both the college and pro levels. The league is planning to expand from 12 teams to 16 by 2028. The 13th franchise, the Golden State Valkyries (playing in San Francisco and owned by the Warriors), was announced last fall and will play their first season in 2025. A still-unnamed Toronto team was announced in May that will start in 2026 along with Portland.

When the Portland team is officially announced, that will make it 15, with one more city still left to be decided. In recent months, Engelbert has named Philadelphia, Denver, Nashville and Miami among the cities that are in the running.

When they bought the Thorns, the Bhathals pledged to build them a dedicated practice facility separate from the one they currently share with their MLS counterpart, the Timbers. Those plans are still in the works with a location still to be finalized, and sources say the eventual new building could also house the practice facility for the WNBA team under the same roof.

Long-term, Portlands new WNBA team will play their home games at the Moda Center, but they may play a couple of seasons at Veterans Memorial Coliseum while the Blazers finish up a planned renovation project in the next few years, the timing of which is still to be determined.",ripcity,65,https://www.reddit.com/r/ripcity/comments/1f5f7ih/sources_bhathal_family_lands_portland_wnba/

2023-12-20,1703057520,I dont think anyone here really understands how good Anfernee is at the age of 24.,"If you want to go look at Dame stats at 24. He is already better offensively. 60.4 ts. Dame dont hit that till 2020. When he was 30. 

We see that shit. Defense wise is where you are all shitting on him. If you take out the jazz game and we all should consider that the biggest coaching failure this year, he is at worst a net nuetral player. He is at worst, a neutral defender on everyone. Small sample size recently sure. 

But recently if you have watched teams have tried to hunt him. Luka, curry, and booker. They try, and even get 1 on 1. They pass out, or they are getting picked because Anfernee has been playing aggressive as hell lately especially on the perimeter. 

We have this pre conceived notion that he is a bad defender when he has been making play after play to show us otherwise. He has been making insane pass after insane pass but since they dont turn into assists we dont care apparently. 

He is younger than Dame was, he is better than Dame was, on both ends statistically, and if you watch our games, way better defensively than Dame was. He is 24. I get that we have had him for what feels like forever. But we drafted him at 19 too. We legitimately have a better younger Dame who fits our timeline, on a cheap ass contract. 

I dont think most of you understand the absolute talent Dame had around him those few years either. Compared to that, ant has played with absolute trash. He is quite literally our best player while still being a kid. He has the shot, he has been incredible on the finish. He is the future of this team.

2024-06-30,1719719659,[Quick] Billups on Saturday told The Athletic he intends to experiment next season with the 7-foot Ayton at power forward and the 7-foot-2 Clingan at center. He also said he continues to encourage Ayton to expand his steady midrange jumper to perhaps incorporate a 3-point shot. ,"Im willing to try things, Billups said. Several teams are playing big  Cleveland, Denver, Memphis & Im going to try having (Clingan) and D.A. out there together. But it depends who is on the floor. Is it Jaren Jackson? Is it Aaron Gordon? Is it Evan Mobley?

Billups nods his head in the affirmative and continues: What Im not going to do is put him out there to guard Jayson Tatum. Or Kevin Durant & its going to be situational. But Im telling you, I think the league is going to try and get bigger in the interior. So, I think it will be fun.

---

Its too early to say definitively whether the Blazers will enter Septembers training camp with Ayton and Clingan. The Blazers have the maximum 15 players under contract, but Cronin told The Athletic he remains in a proactive mode of upgrading the roster.

---

Billups said he will employ the same drop defense he used last season (the center drops toward the basket while defending the pick-and-roll), when Portland ranked 23rd out of 30 teams in defensive efficiency. Dropping to protect the rim is Clingans strength, which is accentuated by his ability to stay vertical, a skill he said was honed by Connecticut coach Dan Hurley. 

---

During his pre-draft workout in Portland, Clingan stunned the Blazers with his outside shooting, which included NBA 3-pointers.

I was shocked. Really shocked, Billups said. He shot it, and it was like & an easy shot.

After the workout, Billups took Clingan into his office and interviewed him. One of his first questions to Clingan was why he attempted only nine 3-pointers over two seasons at UConn.

He gave me one of the best answers a kid could have given me: He said, I just wanted to do what coach needed me to do to win. And to me, thats just a winner.

Billups said Clingan will enter the season with a green light to shoot 3-pointers, provided he is open and its a smart shot. ",ripcity,68,https://www.reddit.com/r/ripcity/comments/1drstqu/quick_billups_on_saturday_told_the_athletic_he/

He's not being asked to do much on offense. I'm fine with that. He's a damned rookie.

His contributions don't always show up on the stat sheet. He doesn't get slick steals like Matisse, and he still occasionally makes a rookie mistake.

Y'all, he was regularly tasked with guarding Dame AND Giannis. And he stayed in front of both of those guys (mostly) all damned game. It was absolutely amazing.

I'm going on record right now as saying if he doesn't have some major injury, he becomes an elite NBA defenderhe's already a good one.

Theres a lot of folks calling for Chaunceys head, but what would you like instead or what realistically is this roster capable of?

There are few coaches that can simultaneously develop young talent and improve the win record. Off the top of my head I can only think of Pops, Spo, and Brad Stevens. One isnt a coach anymore and the other two are not moving. 

The other option is bring in a coach that only values wins, that means lean heavy on vets and shoot for 30 wins while the youth earns their reps in practice and in blowouts. 

Last night there were 5 rookies and second year players getting meaningful minutes and at times played really well.

I remember Roys rookie year and the Spanish Armada. Those teams were baaad, but what they got known for early on was being a hard out in Portland. They were young and couldnt play on the road to save their lives, but improved after tons of loses. 

There is zero continuity with this team and our best player is out. Were at the stage of trying to win quarters and mismatches, not games. 

Watch for progress from the young guys, which the second year players are showing. I understand the frustration with not seeing clean run successful plays. But with guys just learning terminology, it aint happening. 

Watch transition, watch the effort to get athletic players in space. Watch when things do work out, especially with the young guys. Ask, how were they confident to take that action?

When they get shutdown at the rim, like Toumani, Jabari, and Scoot watch to see if they learn from it and take a different tact in the next game. 

With developing raw players, its more about learning how to adjust to the pace and size of the NBA than just running plays. *yes is is vital, but not when youre getting first run to a lottery team*

If the young guys give up or stop showing improvement over the next few months, then talk about Chauncey. So far the second year players look vastly better than last year, some is talent, but plenty IS coaching.",ripcity,118,https://www.reddit.com/r/ripcity/comments/17jy121/folks_just_breath_its_a_complete_rebuild/

2024-04-29,1714367375,"Man, I feel really bad for Dame.","Yes, I know his exit from the Blazers was ugly. I was as pissed as everyone else when he hung our organization out to dry claiming only Miami. 

But at the same time, no Blazer (except perhaps Brandon Roy) has shocked and thrilled me the way Damian Lillard has. I watched his first rookie game Live against Steve Nash, Dwight Howard, and Kobe Bean Bryant and knew immediately how truly special his career would be. 

His stoic demeanor under pressure and ceaseless work ethic meant that his mental game was already well beyond his years, in spite of playing for a smaller school and smaller crowds by NBA standards.

Fast forward to now: like a Nazgรปl hes haunted by the ghosts of a ring that he feels will be the crowning achievement of his career and the resting place of his ambition. So he finally gets himself to a team that has a real shot- a 2x MVP and finals winner, a top tier center and elite mid range shooting guard, a defensive minded backup pg, and Dame Dolla, one of the most clutch players in NBA history and a volume scorer.

Hes up 1-0 after dropping one of the most impressive scoring halves in his career, effectively making the second half completely stress free. Its finally happening, he says to himself, I can carry the torch until the next round and the Greek Freak will come back rested and hungry to take over.

Now, hes down 1-3 against Tyrese Haliburton and the nightmare matchup Pacers who gave them a massive deflating loss in the regular season as well. Giannis couldnt participate in a single game. Bucks getting ravaged on the offensive glass. Two highly painful Achilles aggravations limiting Dame majorly in the crucial game 3. Doc even reporting that Lillard was a distraction in overtime. No Dame Time this time.

Yes, theres always next year, and yes, I know he can dry his tears with his millions and models. But Im gutted for him on how this year played out. A frustratingly impotent playoff run, a painful divorce with 3 young children, and calling lonely cold Milwaukee home for the last year all for naught.

Anyone else on this sub feel similar? With our team being in the dumpster for the foreseeable future I put a lot of my fandom energy into Dames ring chase, hopefully they can stretch things out for Damian to get another crack at it, but its looking pretty rough.

First of all, because Deni is currently the only Israeli player in the NBA, expect a big rise in your fan base and for at least a few thousand of new followers.

The second point is that as an Israeli, I felt obliged to see most wizards games for 4 years now (yikes). I can say about his play style that he is a great defender with good play making abilities to pass and create shots for himself and he has a good size for the type of player that he is. In short, he will become one of your favorite players when you see him play.

So now lets enjoy this crazy trade because we and many other passionate Israeli fans are going to support the team in the near future.

Roy only lasted for 5 seasons with the Blazers, and it was really unfortunate to see his career end prematurely, but one thing people need to understand is that this guy revitalized the franchise's image that was tarnished by the infamous Jail Blazers era.

There have been some recent rumblings that Brogdon has been hopeful that the Blazers would entertain contract extension talks.,"Source: https://marcstein.substack.com/p/mondays-latest-from-nba-trade-season

&gt; Malcolm Brogdon has been openly lobbying the Trail Blazers to keep him beyond Thursday's trade deadline.

&gt; Long considered one of this season's Most Likely To Be Traded players after landing in Portland before the season started when Boston acquired Jrue Holiday from the Blazers, Brogdon recently told The Athletic's Jason Quick that he was rooting against a deal.

&gt; ""Im happy here,"" Brogdon told Quick. ""Im valued here. ... And I cant complain with that. Im happy in Portland.

&gt; There have been some recent rumblings that Brogdon, with one season left on his current contract after this one at $22.5 million, has been hopeful that the Blazers would entertain contract extension talks. Portlands willingness to go that far is rather hard to picture given the understandable focus on its array of young guards  most notably Anfernee Simons and rookie Scoot Henderson  but the prospect of a longer stay than anticipated in the Pacific Northwest for the 31-year-old has gained credence.",ripcity,169,https://www.reddit.com/r/ripcity/comments/1ajq3mb/stein_malcolm_brogdon_has_been_openly_lobbying/

2024-01-15,1705341110,"Against all odds, Reath made the NBA after&growing up in a hut with no bed or shoes during a civil war that killed 2 million civilians, living in a refugee camp, playing in community college, getting cut from three summer leagues, and playing in four continents.","This past summer I was doing some reading on the Sudanese civil wars, which is one of the most brutal and long-running conflicts that we in the West don't really hear about in the daily news. In one form or another, conflict has been going on between the mostly Muslim northern Sudan and the Christian southern Sudan since independence from the British in 1955, until southern independence in 2006. But, the second phase of the civil war lasted from 1983-2005, and may have claimed the most civilian casualties of any war since WW2 (obviously precise numbers are impossible to find). [Anyways, Reath grew up the eldest of seven children, in a hut with no bed or shoes](https://www.tigerrag.com/the-incredible-journey-of-duop-reath/). When he was 9, his family moved to Kakuma refugee camp in Kenya, where they stayed until a relative was able to move to Australia and sponsor Duop's family for citizenship. (side note: young Luol Deng ended up in the UK fleeing this same war).

Anyways it's pretty amazing that Reath and his family were able to overcome the war and lack of education, and find their way to a refugee camp and eventually to Australia, where Reath started playing basketball in high school (after starting out with soccer and Aussie football). He eventually was recruited by Lee College, a community college in Texas, before transferring to LSU for his junior and senior year (where he was teammates with Skylar Mays). After graduating, he played in Serbia, China, Australia, and Lebanon while being cut after three summer leagues (this past summer was his fourth summer league and he finally was offered a contract).

Truly an absolutely insane journey to the NBA and he deserves every bit of success.

* To begin with, it's not too common that juco players end up in the NBA, although it does happen (Jimmy Butler and Jae Crowder come to mind).

* It's *extremely* rare that he would go undrafted, play overseas for four years in four different leagues, play in 3 summer leagues without a training camp invite, and finally end up with a contract at age 27. 

* It's **extraordinarily** rare that Duop's family made it out of Kakuma refugee camp in under a year (many people stay there their entire lives because they have no home to go back to, and [the average stay in that refugee camp is 19 years](https://www.fairfield.edu/news/archive/2023/march/honors-students-present-walk-in-their-shoes-refugee-experience.html)).",ripcity,19,https://www.reddit.com/r/ripcity/comments/197ex9x/against_all_odds_reath_made_the_nba_aftergrowing/
