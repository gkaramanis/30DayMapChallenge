Pretty much confirmed what a lot of us in this sub have thought. The starters played way too many minutes in the regular season because of the weak bench we had. The lakers series even though it was a short series took something out of them. Despite all that they were up 20 in game 7 at home to reach the WCF. This is why I like the Westbrook signing so much, no matter whats going on in a game he will provide energy and a spark. 

A lot of people in this sub and the national media are down on the nuggets but I believe this team will surprise a lot of people. The bench is way better and more versatile than it was last year, Malone will be creative with his rotations im sure. Im taking a well rested and now hungry again Murray, Gordon, MPJ and Jokic with any 5th starter against any team in the nba in a 7 game series.

2023-10-31,1698738495,Lets just take a moment today to cherish how wonderful it is that Jokic is completely drama-free and staying here forever.,"Meanwhile, Im setting the line for the inevitable Embiid trade request at one year from today. And honestly Im probably taking the under. 

The Harden trade is:

Clippers get: James Harden, PJ Tucker, Filip Petrusev

Sixers get: Marcus Morris, Nicolas Batum, Robert Covington, KJ Martin, 2028 unprotected first, 2024 second, 2029 second, 2029 first pick swap, protected 2026 first from OKC (also waiving Danny Green)

Morris, Batum, and Covington used to be really good players, but all of them are has-been depth guys at best today. So none of the new Sixers are even close to being stars. And Embiid has shown us time and time again that he is not going to just take over playoff series on his own. Hes just not that guy.

It probably depends a bit on the exact nature of the pick swap and third-team first, but seems pretty clear to me that the best path for Philly is to start over asap and build around Maxey. I think Embiid tries to get to the Knicks next summer at the latest, and it will be a huge story all season long until he does.

Im calling it now: were going to win 60 games, go back-to-back, and the basketball media still wont be paying attention lol.



Edit: I saw some updated coverage that the Sixers intention is to flip the expiring contracts and picks for a star from a different team this season or next summer. Who the hell do they think theyre going to get that would actually move the needle? To be fair, Harden forced their hand, but Embiid has already hinted at leaving and I think thats inevitable now.

Also, just to clarify, I think Maxey is awesome! He has a lot of potential and is fun to root for. But hes 22 and completely unproven as a star. Embiid is turning 30 this season, and given his injury history, its hard to be optimistic about how long his prime will be. 

And btw, I dont think the Clippers are any better either. They might win some more regular season games, but Harden is a huge liability in the playoffs. Tucker is interesting I guess, but the dude is 38. The Clippers biggest problem before this was culture not talent imo, and Harden just multiplies that. I could be wrong, but I think this will be a disaster.

key points:

\- ""All Nicky Karabel wanted for his birthday was to see Joel Embiid play in person. Just once, you know? So father Sam shelled out $500.""

\- ""A few minutes later, Embiid came out to the floor for his pregame routine. Sam had Nicky hold up the sign for the league MVP to see, hoping it might bring him over for a high-five. An autograph. A wave. Something.

The note was on a white board that stretched from Nickys shins to his chest. It was so big, in fact, that if Nicky wasnt 8 and adorable, Nuggets security told me, they wouldve confiscated it, per arena policy. It read:

*HAVE NO FEAR EMBIID IS HERE""*

\- ""As Embiid finished his warm-up for an afternoon on his backside, Nicky and his family huddled with other Sixers fans above the West tunnel, the shortest distance to the away locker room, waving that sign, leaning over hopefully, hoping to get his jersey signed.

Embiid blew through the tunnel.

\-"" When I caught up with the Karabels a few minutes later, Dad was hugging his young son tight. Nickys cherubic face had turned bright red, cheeks flushed, eyes downed in tears of disappointment. No autograph. No recognition. No nothing.""

They talk about how many points he averaged, but Luka averaged more points, assists, and rebounds. They talk about how he had the number 1 seed, but we had the same record as them. And Shaq talked about stat stuffing, but if you look at every stat combined with advanced metrics, Jokic was the winner by a mile.

2024-02-15,1708038036,A gentle reminder for some Nuggets fans,"After a brutal 3 game-losing streak going into Allstar, I've seen some horrendous takes about our incredible team, mainly wishing we had Bruce Brown and JEFF GREEN back. Things always feel worse watching it live, so just as a quick reminder of last season's stats.   


[Jeff Green](https://basketball.realgm.com/player/Jeff-Green/Summary/37): 7 pts / 2 reb / 1 ast / .28 3pt%   
[Bruce Brown](https://basketball.realgm.com/player/Bruce-Brown-Jr/Summary/85612):  11 pts / 4 reb / 3 ast / .35 3pt%  
Before All-Star we were [41/18](https://www.statmuse.com/nba/ask/denver-nuggets-record-before-all-star-break) in 1st, with the [28th hardest schedule](https://www.espn.com/nba/stats/rpi/_/sort/SOS/year/2023)  


Now compare it to this season and their replacements  


[Payton Watson](https://basketball.realgm.com/player/Peyton-Watson/Summary/133038): 6 pts / 2 reb / 1 ast / 1 blk / .33 3pt%   
[Reggie Jackson](https://basketball.realgm.com/player/Reggie-Jackson/Summary/3771): 10 pts / 2 reb / 4 ast / .37 3pt%  
Before All-Star we are 36/19 in 4th, with the [11th hardest schedule](https://www.espn.com/nba/stats/rpi/_/sort/SOS)   


I know we're comparing players' stats between a season and 3/4 season, but I think people are greatly over-remembering what Bruce and Jeff brought to the team. I also don't think people are considering just how much harder this season has been. It's one thing to have such a hard schedule, but it's another to do it with the champions targets on your back. Every game we play the teams will be giving their all because they're going against the champs. Not to mention the West has also gotten so much harder than it was last season.   


As far as I see it we've had a very similar season, with much tougher odds, but with greater benefits. We've given some rookies incredible developing time, not to mention another whole year of the starters growing their cohesion. Give them some rest, let them get healthy, and get ready for another incredible playoff run!

**The following is the translated text**

After returning to Pudong Airport from the trip, it took a while to get back to life from the sleepiness of the 8 1/2 hour flight and the heat of the game earlier in the day. Due to the high level of immersion in basketball and local culture that we experienced every day in the UAE, we didn't have the time or energy to summarize what we saw and heard throughout the entire trip, so I apologize to those of you who have been asking about what's going on in the UAE through various channels.

If there is one word to describe the eleven days of traveling with 20 nuggets fans , it must be unparalleled.

From the moment I met Taylorcracy, who was traveling with me from Hefei early in the morning on the 3rd, a subtle feeling accompanied me throughout the entire trip. Even though almost everyone except me didn't know each other, we could be spotted at once at the boarding gate in Kunming to Dubai - that's the gold-digging element on our bodies. Because I had to accompany my daughter-in-law to the mall, I was the last of the Kunming transfer group to arrive at the boarding gate; by the time I arrived, two rows of seats had been filled with young people in snowy mountain and rainbow costumes, a scene that resembled some school club organizing an autumn excursion. What's more, there was no shortage of passing mine honeys who weren't on this trip snapping photos and posting them to the fanbase to ask questions, and I didn't expect to be right on the money.

I landed around 7pm local time, physically and mentally exhausted from the long flight, and the cool colors of the Dubai airport and the crowded ferry buses were a shot in the arm for what should have been an exciting time for us. For me personally, this gray lens feel rubbed off the filter after meeting up with my old friend and professional tour leader for this trip, STOCK. As another small group that arrived a day before us, from Chengdu, they had already had a full day of fun in Dubai. After the head count, it was clear that most of the group was still in a restrained state, except for the crowd that had already dealt with previous transfers, as most had curbed their curiosity during the 2-hour drive from Dubai to Abu Dhabi after this, to the point that the opening remarks and introductions from the local guide didn't get enough response. After checking in at the Hilton, I bought some instant noodles and achieved the feat of arriving in a new city and going to sleep without doing any shopping, who cares who or where.

The next day's tour started at the Louvre, and the 40 degree heat of Abu Dhabi made the colors of the first group photo we took under the scorching sun particularly bright. After the Nuggets Champions chant that accompanied the video, we finally got rid of the tiredness from last night and started taking pictures in groups. This happiness continues to the NBA DISTRICT interactive exhibition, a bus we met the street ball legend Professor Professor, to our team duck head (I myself easy to remember the members of the group in accordance with his WeChat avatar in my own heart nicknamed) excited to fly, hard to control the professor in the front of the bus and we interacted for up to a minute. The professor interacted with us in front of the car for a minute, but only afterward did he realize that he himself had been holding up the pocket and did not press the record button, I think this incident is enough for him to regret for three days.

Subsequent to the event, we met Fisher, Henry, Kasey, the experience gradually full; I also because of the store at the door of the event of a shooting game hit, I got the opportunity to get 50% off coffee, to the snow bunny and his wife, each whole cup.

Arrived at the dinner place Yas mall, the sky is still dark, rushed into the largest local nbastore after I found an empty board jersey, take away printed with my own name No. 56 robe, but also to complete a in Beijing did not realize the wish. It's worth mentioning that here, I also ran into my elementary school years in the mine acquaintance fly of the fish-eating birds, even if I knew in advance that he would also travel to the UAE to watch the game alone, but this kind of spanning more than ten years of the face of the base or let him excitedly shake my hand up and down for a long minute, until I yelled for the fourth time to get tired before letting go. Then after a group dinner, it was time for the real purpose of our trip - the Nuggets vs. Celtics preseason opener.

https://preview.redd.it/ka9bqufegtud1.png?width=640&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8891f269a4b6da77ca4d82b07bf1bd6de2878605

From the moment we got off the bus, we passed a banner with Nuggets players on it, and everyone took out their cell phones and started recording. Layers of security checks, walk into the stands we immediately rushed to the front row to start playing cards, but found the presence of the field only a few green players are still training, waiting for a long time did not see the Nuggets out, we had to return to their seats to wait patiently.

With the consumption of time, I thought I had calmed down the heart along with the sound of my favorite opening music Right above it rekindled. Out of my love for competitive basketball, the Celtics' players coming out was enough to get my blood pumping, and when the Nuggets, who were considered the home team, appeared on the big screen, my heart couldn't hold it down any longer. The moment Rocky's flag came out of the court, my eyes were already filled with tears without me even realizing it; I knew all the next parts of the game, which direction Rocky would run in next, the Humpty Dumpty sprint that Jokic would surely make, and when Murray and Gordon would touch fists and interact, and all of these scenes were just like a running light that flashed across my mind over and over again at the speed of light in an incredibly short period of time. All of these scenes were like running lights that flashed through my head at the speed of light thousands of times in a very short period of time.

Fifteen years, I waited for fifteen years, this year 27 years old, I have spent more than half of my life to love to follow everything, with my most familiar sound and picture strongly impacted every organ in my body from head to toe, even the air is spread only belong to the Highlander basketball scent. I held up my cell phone to record all this, in order not to let my daughter-in-law find my tears, had to ask him to help me hold up the pocket to record the video to distract from this moment; after all, in her eyes, I am a piece of wood without seven feelings never cried. But the truth is, even just reliving writing these words makes my eyes wet again.

https://preview.redd.it/gswl3w3ditud1.jpg?width=1080&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=04f7cc5c4f1d0008cb93698241d7760272ccdae9

Because of basketball, I know a lot of smelly friends, in our circle there is no lack of many friends who have been to the scene, seen a lot of exquisite copywriting and circle of friends photos to get a lot of likes and envious comments, but the only thing that was patrolling the mountain that year to write down the words impressed. He went to Oklahoma to watch the game and left a long speech at the height of the Murray incident in 2019, and here I'll just excerpt two paragraphs to describe my similar mood that appeared at a similar time and scene: When I went downstairs and walked out of the hotel to the ballpark, I suddenly burst into tears, and that kind of feeling is indescribable, which may be the feeling of a dream that is going to be realized in front of you, and it can finally be seen and touched. can be seen and touched, the distance between me and my dream is only a five-minute walk ...... , The moment I entered the dugout, I don't know why I suddenly calmed down, it was like I was also a local fan who had come to see the game countless times with my season tickets, it felt like the people and the field and the logo in front of me were so familiar, I had seen it countless times.

https://preview.redd.it/dxni2m3hgtud1.png?width=624&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=cc1ad32e6008d3be833cc9e51e09d9ebaa590d50

Over the course of the ensuing game, both of my units recorded Murray's lone three-pointer of the game, saw the energy Willis brought to this team in his Nuggets career debut, and then got fed half-court shit from Pickett. As the game progressed, we and the Celtics fans shouted cheers at each other, and even if it's nothing compared to the decibel counts emanating from arenas stateside, it's the biggest and most responsive I've ever heard in my life for a Nuggets chant, and I love it here. Each and every one of us couldn't get enough of it after the game, because we knew that we could have this atmosphere for a long time to come, and that tomorrow morning, tomorrow night, and the day after that belonged to us, and to the Denver Nuggets.

https://preview.redd.it/foyykhrigtud1.png?width=640&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=62ffd1477f87659256ed6c6bafa8ff140312db94

The day after the game we traveled to the Presidential Palace and I have to say it was really nice to see. Unfortunately when we tried to take a picture we realized that the banner from the day before had been confiscated when we entered the arena, so you can see that the local area is really scared of political propaganda. After the end of the trip, we still arrived at the NBA DISTRICT in the afternoon, some members of the team chose to go to the mall because they had had their fun, while I had a clear purpose, which was to squat to the former Nuggets Hall of Famer Camby. Good luck to the explosion, into the door straight to the stadium area, then, fixed eyes on the fans found in the autographs Kambi, did not take much effort to squeeze into the front row to get a signature to complete today's task.

Subsequently wandering around, met a very bright and stylish old man, I know things are not simple, online search is actually a former Michael Jackson's designer, the name is Jeff Hamilton, can be photographed are some of the first-class international stars, that is, no matter who first shot a fan photo of the same style of Wang Hedi and then in the Celtics I just received short-sleeved (activity site with preseason tickets to receive, it sounds like only the Green Army). It sounds like it is only made the green army's pressure root no you mine...) The Celtics short sleeve (sounds like it's only the Green Army that does not have your mine...). The finale of the day's activities is Xiao Luo and Figo, glanced at no interaction opportunities after decisively left the scene, ready to meet with partners and go to the evening of the fan appreciation day activities.

https://preview.redd.it/ton4xoelgtud1.png?width=640&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=024fb4a6f339b18004821ac172549207cd548b66

As a result of a long time in advance through the Sizhe and the team reached a cooperation, we will be in the fans day on behalf of the Chinese fans and the team to interact with the gift, all the excitement is very excited, even to the moment of entering the stadium, we have not been official accurate time and operation of the exercise. At the entrance of the stadium, we held a fan printed in Chinese stylized with the identity of the country quickly attracted the attention of the official media, continuous cooperation with them to complete the interview and video recording, we also entered the stadium through the security check.

Since the tickets for the fan day were bought together, all of us sat together, expecting the official to give us specific news, as for the shooting challenge on the court Pickett or Strawser, we all just regarded it as a pastime in the experience. After watching exotic show after exotic show, we didn't get to wait for our moment after all, accompanied by an apologetic message popping up on WhatsApp from the staff. SORRY! IT WAS KIND OF CHAOTIC DOWNTOWM THERE!, as if a pot of cold water had been poured over our heads, and as the players exited one by one, the fans lost their minds and headed out of the arena.

https://preview.redd.it/efxt9jwogtud1.png?width=640&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d5edc1b9b71dfebe3b1da26b8dab5843dd80b9a5

I walked against the flow of people towards the edge of the railing where I interacted with the Celtics mascot, LUCKY, which meant Rocky was doing the same thing in the other corner of the arena. I stood on the sidelines and uncharacteristically yelled Rocky! at the Nuggets mascot across the court, even if it looked funny to a group of Green fans. In fact, I'm not sure if I was trying to vent my frustration at the official failure to fulfill his promise or if I was really just hoping to interact with Rocky, but I was really hoping he would come over and bring some good luck to an imperfect night. Miraculously, after countless shouts, Rocky did come over! Like he could hear the aggravation in our hearts, he traveled across the entire dugout and came straight to us! Yes, Rocky left his clear handwriting on my customized Nuggets jersey that I just had made yesterday (which, according to Jay and Siegel, is a rare thing even for local Denver fans), and his sellout performance brought a little relief to our lost feelings. But regardless, the disappointment and sadness of not being able to deliver the gifts from China to the players still left most of us feeling a sense of disappointment and sadness that was pervasive throughout the bus ride to the mosque. We took a lot of pictures of the magnificent mosque from the same spot where the players had stood during the day, but due to the general mood, such an important site didn't give us a better experience than the McDonald's downstairs. It was an early night for us all.

On the third day of the nba event, I went downstairs in a daze ready to head out to kick off today's trip, only to see everyone at the door saluting each other to a fat black guy. stock saw me coming downstairs and explained to me first, saying that this old man was from Denver and that he had introduced us to a lot of stories about the players he had worked with; he then told the old black guy about me - -While I was still feeling sad about yesterday's events, this fat black man's exclamation interrupted my despondency, and at the same time he began to rummage quickly in his backpack, and eventually pulled out a Nuggets culture shirt that he had made himself and gave it to me, and as a return gift I gave him the fan shirt that I had originally brought to the team yesterday. In return, I gave him the fan I had planned to bring to the team yesterday.

He said his name was DC White and that he'd lived in Denver for 15 years, and then frantically showed us pictures of him with various ballplayers, including Klay, James, Trae Young, in addition to everyone from the Nuggets... He must be a huge fan! After giving us each another Nuggets badge, White said goodbye to us and we started our day at Ferrari Land on Yas Island.

https://preview.redd.it/4hv6usxrgtud1.png?width=640&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a1c95163d2819890f57f579ed5531cb96ffa1b61

By the time the afternoon rolled around, since we didn't get to see the players practice for the first game, we exited Ferrari Land early to gather for the trip to the arena, with the plan to rush in and watch the practice the first time the doors opened for ticketing. Meanwhile, Sizhe, who was in Denver, woke up early and sent me a message saying that he had talked to his colleague in Abu Dhabi to arrange a gift for us for the game, so everything seemed to be on the up and up again. Fortunately, we were able to rush in as soon as the doors opened; unfortunately, I was stopped at the security gate, and after three minutes of pleading with the African man in charge of security, I had to leave my gift outside the stadium; even more unfortunate, after entering the stadium, the WhatsApp I was using to communicate with the team staff would only spin around and not read the messages.

I stood in the front row of the Nuggets' tunnel with a couple of close friends and shouted vigorously to every player coming out of the arena, receiving responses from most of them! The most courteous of them all was Chancellor, who flashed us his trademark smile with every cheer, even though, according to Taylorcracy, a member of the group who flew in from Hefei with me, Chancellor had already trained ten iron shots in a row in front of him.

After looking left and right to see no more players walking back and forth, I spotted a familiar figure, assistant coach Ryan Bowen. His broken pinky finger made him instantly recognizable even to me, a level ten face blindness sufferer. I yelled Bowen's name, and he seemed surprised, immediately looking and walking toward me; meeting someone else on the way to talk to him interrupted his route toward me, but as I yelled his name again, he told me with a look that he'd be right over when he was done. Coach Bowen didn't lie to me, and came to me immediately after the conversation. I told him happily that I knew him, and had been following him since the summer league two years ago, and he was as happy as a child, asking for my name again and again, with a look of relief that was as warm as if he had met an old friend in his hometown.

https://preview.redd.it/rxx1wcswgtud1.png?width=640&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d93f0ff951fbe2deee19e3e7c6c3fa2a82d047d4

After saying goodbye to Coach Bowen, I still couldn't get in touch with the team, and Sizhe told me that the Nuggets' staff was looking for me, but they were out of net as well. When I was regretting that I didn't ask Coach Bowen to help me to establish a line, a blue dress host appeared in front of me, after I was sure that she was the host of the Nuggets event, I felt that she looked like Katy Winge, a famous Nuggets blogger on the X, so I shouted Katy! I shouted Katy! without thinking, and my friends started shouting at her, and to my surprise she spotted us and came over to me. After a few warm pleasantries, I expressed my wish to give the team a gift from China, and she agreed. At this point, I hurriedly collected the fans that my friends had brought in, and found that only four of them were with us, while the others were still on the snow bunnies' bodies. Disappointed, I told Katy that we had brought gifts for each of the players, but that some of our mates were away at the moment, so these were the only ones left. She wasn't the least bit embarrassed and immediately took the fans towards the rest of the staff to communicate and show them off after giving us another photo and autograph. When she returned again, she handed me a picture of Aaron Gordon with a gold signature attached. I was ecstatic and overwhelmed with gratitude for her! She then pulled out a signed photo of Jamal Murray and gave it to the rest of the team, Blackie. How in the world could such a wonderful event happen? I hurriedly asked my partners to send a message to the group to inform the others to come to the players' tunnel to meet up. Ten minutes later, Snow Bunny appeared in front of me with a big sigh of relief carrying all the remaining fans, we hollered for Katy again and told her we did it, these are the other fans, please make sure you pass them on to the players for us, she was as reliable as ever, took the gift and headed to the work area to make the communication.

The game was just about to start, and I was making my way up the stairs again to get ready to find my seat when I ran into DC White, the Denver fan who had been bragging to us for so long that morning. While none of us could quite believe how many people he knew, he greeted every passing Nuggets staff member, and called out to Denver Post reporter Sean Keeler, as well as MVP Westbrook. Westbrook took off the sneakers he was wearing and handed them directly to the young man on our team who was wearing a Willis jersey. The moment he was handed his sneakers, his expression changed from happy, to surprised, to godless in countless subtle ways, countless celebratory shouts erupted around him, and every one of us was genuinely happy for him. Finally, after another 3 minutes or so of accepting this reality, he opened his cell phone and dialed the home video call and cried out, This is from Westbrook! Westbrook to me! I'm sure that the period of time when his eyes were glazed over was just as mixed as the time when I first stepped into this arena.

https://preview.redd.it/pvtbusw3htud1.png?width=640&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=963f4a0c84dfd2aba31fe278bdddd10bca9e6054

Returning to my seat after this joyous interaction, I suddenly felt that I had gradually completed my transformation over the past period of time, and that I had become less like me. Why was this? In my life, I have been a professional basketball reporter, an in-depth sports media, a small leader of an Internet company, a snow god in the hearts of fans, the moderator of the Chinese Nuggets Zone, the founder of the Snowy Mountain site, and a heavy-loaded basketball practitioner, and I have never lacked the opportunity to meet the stars, and have independently accomplished the interviews with a lot of big-name stars, so I can talk to the team and the players in a very eloquent way, but how long has it been since I have been a crazy fan, just like I was just now? But how long has it been since I was just a crazy fan like I was just now? It seems that the scene of speaking English in foreign countries has made me dilute the layers of shackles, and I prefer to believe that it is the partners around me who really love highland basketball that have accomplished the redemption for me.

https://preview.redd.it/kc48wsf6htud1.png?width=640&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5744053dda32c1411352dc151e1816ca282f88eb

After the game started, we were still immersed in the joys and rewards of the night. With Gordon, Willis and Porter missing, the Nuggets were quickly outscored, outplayed and outplayed by the Celtics during the time Murray and Jokic were resting. After the game gradually lost suspense I once again opened my cell phone and found a message from Sizhe: Can you see it? The staff are asking if you're in the players tunnel stands, I replied in the affirmative and said that we had done it and had given Katy all the presents, and he was the next to be puzzled. What Katy, this is Kerry Anne! Katy was there, but you've got the wrong girl! But it doesn't matter, just give it to her, I've spoken to her before, everyone knows your story, she'll be able to help you!. .

So in fact, we all know, so all along, we are not alone, even in the ballroom without network; just like every one of our Nuggets fans, even if we have experienced more wind and rain, put away the umbrella, we will definitely find each other's existence, we will one day witness the arrival of the rainbow together. And bathing in our rainbow in Etihad Arena, that's now.

Thank you for taking 20 minutes to read through this nutrient-less running diary of the rest of the story, the story of how we celebrated with each other together on the bus ride back, the laughter that filled the entire trip, all the way to Warnerland the next day, all the way back to Dubai, all the way back to our own mundane worlds, all the way far, far away, all the way back to the Denver Nuggets and the love of this sport that we will always have. The Denver Nuggets are the best team in the world, basketball is the best sport in the world, and you, who support it all, are the best fans in the world!

(These are the things he had to give up to get in better playing shape.)

No matter what happens tonight, let's not define this season solely by how they play in a single game. 

More important, win or lose, let us never forget how lucky we are to have Nikola Jokic play for us, toil for us, and represent us with honor. And win or lose, never forget how much Nikola Jokic has brought to the Denver Nuggets, including our first-ever championship.

And finally, I humbly type these words on my phone with fingers dripping with an obscene amount of burek grease: on behalf of Denver Nuggets fans in Asia and all over the world, I offer all of Nuggets Nation my very best wishes for tonight's game and beyond!

2024-05-10,1715336736,Why doubt now? Nugs in 7,"Jokic has yet to be his efficient self this entire playoffs, and obviously the same with Jamal. But with this long rest, it may be the catalyst of something that can reignite this team. It all has to start Friday night and with the way the wolves are dialed in  and playing defense (some of the best of this modern era), I have heavy doubts. 

But due to last years dominant walk thru the playoffs, I think WE have FORGOTTEN that this core has always been capable of getting up off the floor when they get knocked down, just to prove everyone wrong. I expect a hell of a response in game 3, and if that happens and we get a W, Then all the pressure is back on the wolves to take game 4. Ive said before that whoever wins this series is gonna represent the west in the finals. And with the wolves showing, its only confirmed those expectations. 

But if there is a team to come back and make this a series in these playoffs.. its a team that has gone through the ringer, who has come back from 3-1 twice, who has always shown up when their backs are against the wall, who doesnt flinch when things look bad&its THIS era of the Denver Nuggets.

We are still a damn good team. Do we need to tweak the edges? Yes. We need scoring off of our bench. CB is a GREAT defensive player, however, he looks timid on offense a lot of times. And he will be more comfortable with time. Same goes with P Wat. However, when we are relying on Reggie Jackson to provide the scoring off of our bench we have an issue. If yall want to talk about moving on from people lets start with Nnaji who still hasnt been able to crack the rotation in a real way. Or Vlatko who has not had a memorable moment for this team in idk how long. But when it comes to the core give this team a break. We have a bunch of fair weather fans in this fan base, and if thats what yall want to be then please go be a fan of whoever wins the ship every year.

Considering hes up for a contract extension soon and has had injury run-ins who on earth could we possible trade him for thats an upgrade?? Some of you need to realize this is real life and not NBA 2k MyGM. Obviously its gonna suck if Jamals inconsistent play and injuries keep up next season but theres literally no better realistic option in the immediate future than us sticking with him. We saw what he can be last playoffs when healthy and him and Jokic have historically great chemistry. Win or lose Sunday Jamal needs to prioritize his offseason training around staying as healthy as can be to last a whole season and the front office needs to get us a bench worth something so we dont run our starters into the ground by playoffs (most minutes this season of any starting 5). 

Side note: this narrative that Jamal has wasted 3 Jokic post seasons being injured is ridiculous. An ACL tear is freak injury and its unfortunate it happened near the end of the season because that injury takes OVER A YEAR to realistically recover from so him playing the playoffs the season after was NEVER happening.

2024-05-10,1715357674,So a few things happened since game 2&.,"1) The Nuggets are now back in their comfort zone of being the counted out team. This team has never been a front runner squad. They thrive on adversity and no one believes in us narratives. People are now talking about the Wolves as the best defense in 20 years and favorites to win the title. How do the Nuggets respond to this?

2) Jamal Murray has something to prove. Not just from a performance standpoint, although he has a lot to prove there, but from an integrity standpoint as well. Hes become one of the villains of this playoffs and is sitting in the same section as Pat Bev.  Not a great place to be. This can backfire and have a hobbled Jamal trying to do too much against an incredible perimeter defense, but lets see how he responds.

3) Jokic experienced the most disrespectful crowning as MVP I can ever remember. And we all know he takes this shit personally, hes just very good at hiding it. He handled it with class, but you know the second that press conference ended he walked his ass back to the weight room and got to work. Jokic also got absolutely dominated by KAT in game 2. That hasnt happened in like 6 years. I 100% believe Joker will pull out every stop in game 3 and hold nothing back.

4) The Nuggets have nothing to lose. They already had their balls taken on national TV. Go out there and punch back. Show them the Wolves arent the only dogs in this series. I think the only way the Nuggets can get back in this series is to match the Wolves defensive intensity and prioritize it over offense. Clean the glass, get out and run, hard double Ant and force him to make decisions with the ball. Make Gobert a feature of their offense. Frustrate KAT, get him in foul trouble. BE PHYSICAL. They have nothing to lose, might as well leave it all out there at this point.",denvernuggets,74,https://www.reddit.com/r/denvernuggets/comments/1cotd3s/so_a_few_things_happened_since_game_2/

2024-03-30,1711838557,Jamal Murray's health is more important than the seeding. ,"8 games to go. Been a crazy season. Nuggets took a couple shots to the throat these last 2 games, but I ain't worried. A healthy Nuggets team can win from any seed. The key is health. The starting 5 for the Nuggets is a unique package, each player complements the other 4 in an amazing fashion. As a whole, when focused and healthy, they are a perfect offensive machine. When a player is missing, especially a player like Jamal Murray, the machine doesn't function at 100%. 

The Nuggets have 23 losses this season. 22 of those have been against teams that currently have a winning record. Diving into those 22 losses, 13 have been when the Nuggets are missing a player or 2 from the starting 5. Specifically, 9 of those losses are without Murray. 

The Nuggets overall record against teams with winning records is 27-22 (.551). The Nuggets are 4-9 in games without Murray playing in those specific games. So, when Murray plays, specifically against the best teams in the NBA, the Nuggets have a record of 23-13 (.638). 

The Nuggets are 40-14 (.741) overall when Murray suits up this season. 

Murray's health is going to trump seeding, so let him rest and then let him dominate when it counts. ",denvernuggets,56,https://www.reddit.com/r/denvernuggets/comments/1brum08/jamal_murrays_health_is_more_important_than_the/

Have we all forgot that we won the freaking championship last year and it's really, really hard to repeat. We lost to the likely champions this season and were one half away from beating them in game 7. We are still in our window and that doesn't change next year. Hopefully our bench continues to improve, and why wouldn't they? When a team is in it's champion window, that's what we ask, to be good enough to compete for the championship which we absolutely did and will absolutely do next year. This is what we hope for from our teams. Stop saying we should trade whoever because we don't win it all every single year.

Search your feelings. You know the answer. Say it. Jokic is not only the face of the league, he's the best face the league has ever had. He's not cocky. He's not flashy. He's not an asshole. He's not bragging about sleeping with 20,000 women. He dominates everyone in the league and then goes home to love his family and his animals. He's going to inspire an entire generation of basketball players around the world to play within themselves, play good fundamental basketball, and be humble.
