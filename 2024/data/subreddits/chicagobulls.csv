2023-11-25,1700937712,"Billy Donovan is part of the problem, but he is far from THE problem.","Ive seen some takes floating around here/Twitter that the Bulls just need to fire Billy and theyll be way better. I just think thats flat-out ridiculous, and heres why: The Bulls have ZERO top-15 guys on the team, and two of our three best players cannot shoot 3s and dont really play well in transition. The role players that surround our big 3 (lol) cannot shoot 3s consistently except for Carter. What coach on planet Earth would be able to cook up a top-15 offense with that roster? Hint: the answer is nobody. Ill agree with people who say that Billy is not a very good offensive coach and isnt very creative on that end of the floor (seems to be a common theme with Bulls coaches for some reason), but he is at least a solid defensive coach, and most players Ive seen that have ever talked about him have nothing but great things to say (outside of Zach, who hasnt bad-mouthed Billy at all, but he is allegedly still upset about being benched over a year ago when he was 1-14 or something like that. And then you have some people who somehow think that coaches like Spo or Pop wouldnt have done the exact same thing).

All of that being said, I do think Donovan shouldnt be the coach of this team for much longer because of how non-creative he is on offense (and because its pretty obvious the whole team, including Billy, is checked out), but please, lets not act like this team is going to turn a corner if all we do is let go of Billy. This roster needs to be torn down completely (outside of the young guys), and if AK/ME dont at least trade Zach and Caruso at the deadline (I would throw DeMar and Vuc in there as well, but Id imagine their contracts are more difficult to trade) then Id argue theyre no better (if not worse) than GarPax. This roster is inherently flawed, and the only solution to this problem is for the front office to finally acknowledge their mistakes and get as many assets as they can for our best players. 

And if we really wanna talk about the main problem, then its really the Reinsdorfs. But I dont see them selling the team anytime soon, so Im not even gonna get into that&.",chicagobulls,114,https://www.reddit.com/r/chicagobulls/comments/183qdnk/billy_donovan_is_part_of_the_problem_but_he_is/

2024-06-22,1719071236,Giddy Thoughts...,"I've been watching a lot of OKC games since the trade and here's what I'm seeing...

**OKC totally misused Giddey.** It jumps off the screen. I mean, they know this for sure... I'm not saying they're dumb; they're not. This is just how it worked out. They don't need a point guard, they need Caruso; someone to play D and shoot the 3. Giddey does neither of these particularly well at this point. 

**Giddey is a legit point guard**. His passing/vision is on par with Zo's. He needs the ball in his hands; I expect this to happen in Chicago and I'm here for it. 

**Giddey is totally _giddy_ to be off OKC and on the Bulls**. You can tell he was frustrated with his role there. His fit on OKC was horrible and it shows on the film. It's kinda uncomfortable to watch, honestly. 

**Giddey guards wings and forwards**. This is smart and will definitely continue under Billy. He'll guard lower scoring wings and forwards (eg. Caruso), or use his length on slower guards (eg. Kyle Lowry). He then sags off his man to help on D and rebound. 

**Acquiring Giddey means DeMar and/or Vuc are gone**. Gonna need some defense from _somewhere_. Giddey is not a _horrible_ defender... I'd say he's approaching average? He's better on D than Coby was his first couple years; worse than Coby's D now. 

**Giddey, Coby, Ayo, Pat, Vuc could be our starting lineup**... I'll just leave that there. 

**Giddey and Caruso will get extensions for similar money... ~ 4 for $80m+.** I mean, prepare yourself for this... it's gonna happen.",chicagobulls,99,https://www.reddit.com/r/chicagobulls/comments/1dlym1n/giddy_thoughts/

He was great at pushing the tempo, getting into the paint, passing/playmaking, rebounding and showed some really good 3pt shooting and soft touch on floaters. 

He struggled with turnovers all tournament though. I would assume that turnovers would be up for most players, not only cause they play on a smaller court but also cause they are very strict with offensive fouls and traveling. He did also have some issues with sloppy plays and physical defense though, he will need to get stronger for sure. 

Him and Zach will have tons of fun on the court together, looks like they will complement eachother really well offensively. ",chicagobulls,39,https://www.reddit.com/r/chicagobulls/comments/1elnzm2/josh_giddey_averages_in_the_olympics_1786_on_50/

2024-01-24,1706120216,Mid-Season Bulls Review,"I posted my [analysis](https://www.reddit.com/r/chicagobulls/comments/16v89s9/reasons_to_be_optimistic_and_pessimistic_about/) before the season started, arguing that the Bulls team is better than it showed last season and that, it could make the playoffs this season.

We are now slightly more than halfway through the season so it's time to review how that prediction is going and how the Bulls have fared so far this season.

**How Have the Bulls Fared So Far?**

At the end of the [First Quarter Review](https://www.reddit.com/r/chicagobulls/comments/18m7fq0/first_quarter_bulls_season_review/), the Bulls were 11-17, 12th in the East. They had the 18th best Offense and 22nd best Defense.

Since then, while the Bulls continued to fight to stay afloat and have continued to win, on balance.  They are now 21-24, good enough for 9th in the East, with the offense falling off a bit to 21st and the defense improving significantly to 15th.

The team continued to win in Zach's absence, led by DeMar and Coby, going 5-2 after Zach's return, though Zach is now out again another week or two. 

**What Has Changed this Season?**

The Bulls finished 5th in defensive efficiency last season.  Some predicted a drop-off, though the plunge to lower third in defensive efficiency did come as a bit of a shock.  The Bulls have started to right that ship, though it remains to be seen whether the Bulls are able to be an elite defensive team again.

Offense is up modestly from 24th to 21st this season.  The Bulls are shooting more 3s this season.  They are now 22nd in attempts up from dead last the previous season.  Another notable change is in offensive rebounding, where the Bulls are getting a whopping 32.9% more offensive boards relative to the previous season.

The Bulls aren't a particularly creative team on offense, ranking 28th in Assists, but they do take care of the ball, leading to the 3rd fewest turnovers.

Donovan has made some adjustments this season trying to jumpstart the offense, though so far, with the team a mediocre 21-24 it's hard to say that the changes have really borne fruit.  Nevertheless, the potential for a solid season is still there.

**Comments on Individual Performances**

It's been a breakout season for Coby White, as he is now averaging 18.8ppg on 46%/40%/82% shooting efficiency and is a potential candidate for most improved player. He's more of a score first PG rather than a distributor, but that's basically how most elite PGs operate in the modern NBA.  He's still only 23 years old.  His breakout has somewhat turned the narrative around for the Bulls as a team with allegedly no future.

Looking at DeRozan and Vooch, it seems that these players might be experiencing a bit of age-related decline.  DeRozan's PER has dropped to 18.2 which is the lowest in 8 seasons, while Vooch's PER of 17.1, which is the lowest outside of his rookie year.  DeMar has pretty much given up on rebounding and he still doesn't shoot a lot of threes, and Vooch's 52% True Shooting leaves much to be desired.  Still, both these players remain productive.

DeMar, who gets a lot of flak for his play, still leads the team in both PPG and APG, often playing de-facto point guard, and he's making a reasonable $28.6 million to be the team's best scorer and passer,

Zach has been the issue.  His scoring efficiency took a hit at the start of the season, then he was injured.  Since coming back, Zach has focused on a more all-round game, with 15.6 ppg 5.8rpg and 5.6apg on solid 49%/39% shooting splits in 7 games since his return.  Those aren't max-contract numbers, but they're pretty good.  The results were positive on balance as the Bulls won 5 of those games, though there wasn't any decisive win over a solid opponent. 

Caruso has become a fan favorite and some advanced statistical analyses point to him being the Bulls best player, even if his basic counting stats aren't particularly impressive.

Patrick Williams isn't having the same kind of breakout season as Coby is having and, statistically, he's simply largely the same player as he has been throughout his career.  He rates as a solid reserve or, at best, a mediocre starter, and you arguably want more than that with a 4th pick in the draft.  Still, he's not a bust in the sense of being in danger of being dropped from the league. He's a year younger than Coby so there's still time for him to take the ""next step"".

Off the bench, Ayo is a solid if somewhat streaky reserve.  With his quickness, I could see him being a 15ppg + scorer in an up-tempo offense (the Buls are dead last in pace).

Drummond is a force of nature.  When it comes to rebounding, he's the equivalent of a 38 ppg scorer. Literally, he has the [highest career rebounding percentage](https://www.statmuse.com/nba/ask/highest-rebound-percentage-in-nba-career) of any player.  In NBA history.  By a significant margin. Some have, quite understandably, argued he should get more minutes.  But, he's not without warts.  He has limited range.  He leads all active Bulls players in both turnovers and fouls per minute.  His 55.4% FT% is basically Shaq (47.8% for his career).  And his 60.6% FG from 0-3 feet is among the lowest on the team and atrocious for an inside player of his size and agility. So I can kind of get why Donovan doesn't use him as much as some might want.  Still, he's a special player and it's great to have him.  Donovan went with a twin towers rotation of playing Vooch and Drummond at the same timer for stretches in the recent Cleveland game, which seemed to work--until it didn't.  As I said in my pre-season review, the Bulls have one of the best center rotations in the league.

The newly signed players, Craig and Carter, have been mostly alright, and the Bulls will hopefully get Craig back in the coming few weeks, which will help because Dalen Terry still doesn't seem quite ready for regular rotation minutes.  

**What to Expect in the Future**

After an atrocious start, the Bulls have been trying hard to dig their way out of the early season hole towards an 0.500 record. They have taken command of the 9th place in the East. One of the legit criticisms of my pre-season analysis was that, outside of Ball, most of the key Bulls players were relatively healthy in Chicago's previous 40-42 effort. I think it's fair to say that the Bulls have been seriously tested with injuries this season and going 21-24 despite them as actually not that bad.

The next few months should be intriguing, as the team which is ahead of them in the standings, and which would now have the homecourt in the play in, is the Orlando Magic, the Bulls trading partner in the controversial Vooch trade--rated as one of the [worst trades](https://bleacherreport.com/articles/10086038-the-5-worst-nba-trades-of-the-last-5-years) of the last 5 years.  Orlando has faded somewhat after a hot start and I'm willing to bet that the Bulls can ultimately overtake them and make the playoffs.

A big question that currently hangs over the Bulls is whether they might trade Zach or even blow up the team.  Many fans want this.  But with Zach seeming to be doing his best to fit in with what the Bulls are doing, and the Bulls going 16-10 since their ugly 5-14 start, I still think the best way forward is to keep muddling through with what the Bulls have (unless some great trade opportunity appears which, according to reports, isn't likely).

The Bulls are within striking distance of a low seed playoff berth.  While there is no Victor Wenbanyama-level young superstar, there are several promising young players along with serviceable veterans.  Though there is a perception that AK has mortgaged the future with recent moves, the Bulls's future prospects aren't completely dire.  The Bulls were ranked [16th](https://bleacherreport.com/articles/10086466-ranking-every-nba-team-by-future-draft-assets) in a recent survey which ranked teams by future draft assets.  Not great, but hardly catastrophic. It seems at least somewhat plausible that PWill and Dosunmu may still take another step forward in their development next year, or even later this year, and that Coby might not be entirely done with improving. While it's possible Lonzo Ball might be done as a serious NBA player, there is maybe at least some chance that he returns at some point next season.  If he can start to give some quality minutes even as a reserve, that would be better than having his contract burning an empty hole in Chicago's payroll.  So the future, while somewhat cloudy, isn't as terrible as some suggest.  

There has been some pretty hysterical reporting about the Bulls and their prospects, like Charles Barkley calling them an ""[embarrassment to the NBA](https://www.basketballnetwork.net/latest-news/an-embarrassment-to-the-nba-charles-barkley-slams-the-chicago-bulls)"" and another analyst claiming that it's ""[unreal](https://www.bleachernation.com/bulls/2024/01/18/how-few-moves-chicag-bulls-two-years/)"" how few moves the Bulls have made, but mostly, I think the Bulls are going in the right direction overall, even though they are trying to muddle through a somewhat challenging period.

2024-10-22,1729587986,Bulls '24-'25 Season Preview,"Hello Bulls' Fans,

As the season is about to commence, I have returned to provide Bulls commentary.  Last season, I opined that the Bulls are [good enough](https://www.reddit.com/r/chicagobulls/comments/16v89s9/reasons_to_be_optimistic_and_pessimistic_about/) to make the playoffs.  That prediction fell just short, as the injury depleted Bulls were eliminated in the second play-in game by the Heat.

This season should be interesting as the Bulls are in the process of a retooling or even an outright rebuild.  What complicates matters is that the Bulls potentially owe their first-round draft pick in the upcoming draft which will convey if it isn't in the top 10.

**Bulls Goals this Season**

The Bulls have two potential goals this season (1) lean further into the rebuild, possibly trading Zach and Vuc, and hopefully land a top 10 pick in next year's draft OR (2) make the playoffs.  The latter seems less likely, but in my opinion, but not entirely out of the question.  The third potential scenario, where the Bulls neither make the playoffs nor secure a top 10 pick, would be the least desirable.  

The Bulls have some young players who are worth getting excited about.  And the Bulls have some vets who could have bounce back seasons and either help push the Bulls into the playoffs (less likely) or could be used as trade bait if they can rehab their value (Zach and Vuc).

Let's first evaluate the recent moves made by the Bulls.

* **Trading DeMar DeRozan in a sign and trader for Chris Duarte and two future second round draft picks plus cash**.  DeMar was **fantastic** for the Bulls in his 3 seasons in Chicago, showing reliable scoring from the midrange, leadership and amazing clutch play.  I know some say that that the Bulls should have traded him earlier.  But the return in this trade is fine and better than just letting DeRozan walk.  Duarte is a former late lottery pick and has started 62 out of the 160 games he's played in.  He made the All-Rookie second team and scored 13.1 ppg in 51 games as a rookie on an admittedly bad Pacers squad.  You have to respect DeMar's longevity, but this trade makes the Bulls younger and gives the team a new direction.
* **Trading fan-favorite Alex Caruso for out of favor Josh Giddey**.  Media were mostly hysterical in slamming the Bulls for this trade because the Bulls didn't get any draft picks in return.  [Sportingnews.com](http://Sportingnews.com) gave the Bulls a [D-](https://www.sportingnews.com/us/nba/news/josh-giddey-alex-caruso-trade-grades-thunder-bulls/e2248de9c2747c7dfdeb8736) grade on the trade, calling it a ""disaster"".  SBNation even gave the Bulls a frikkin [""F"" grade](https://www.sbnation.com/nba/2024/6/20/24182742/alex-caruso-trade-grades-josh-giddey-chicago-bulls-oklahoma-city-thunder).  That's simply unbelievable as it suggests that there's nothing salvageable from the trade whatsoever.  Huh??  I say this trade will prove its worth, potentially in a big way.  Look, there's no doubt that Caruso was the team's best defender and he developed into a very reliable long-range shooter.  The Bulls are going to sorely miss him, especially on defense (judging even by the scores in the preseason).  That said, Caruso was and has always been a role player.  Maybe the best role-player in the NBA, but a role-player nevertheless.  He's only averaged double figures in scoring once in his career, which was this past season when he scored 10.1ppg.  And let's not forget that, in his best season, he was only on the court for 28.7 minutes per game a career high.  Sure, the Bulls are going to miss him.  And it's a legit question whether they should have gotten some draft capital for him. And Gidey does come with some character concerns.  And the Bulls face a big decision about signing him to his next contract. But Josh Giddey has potential to be a legit NBA starter at the point, and maybe a lot more.  Yes, he doesn't consistently stretch the floor and in the modern NBA, that's a serious deficiency.  And his defense is suspect.  But he's a legit triple double threat night in and night out.  Outside shooting can be learned over time.  Once he finds his stride and puts up a few triple doubles, the Bulls will start to feel a lot better about this trade and the world will see it in a new light.  He's only 22 years old so the Bulls got significantly younger again.  And 6'8"" PGs don't grow on trees.
* Let's think about this trade from the following perspective.  During the past season, the Bulls tried to shop Caruso by reportedly [asking](https://nbaanalysis.net/bulls-jonathan-kuminga-warriors-alex-caruso-nba-trade-rumors-news/) the Warriors for Jonathan Kuminga and some fans on this board said that was irresponsible, dumb, and completely delusional, as there is no way that the Warriors would give up Kuminga for Caruso, a narrative I pushed back on at the time.  But let's compare Giddey to Kuminga.  Remember, they were in the same draft class where Giddey was drafted 6th and Kuminga 7th.  In a [redraft](https://medium.com/@MarcWeberSports/re-drafting-the-2021-nba-draft-b072c5f561e7) of the 2021 draft class, Marc Weber has Giddey redrafted at 7th and Kuminga at 9th.  A later dated [redraft](https://bleacherreport.com/videos/574720-2021-nba-redraft-vod) by BleacherReport which includes a rear-view look at the playoffs has Giddey at 11th and Kuminga at 7th, still pretty close (Ayo was picked 14th in both redrafts).  Kuminga has a cumulative PER of 15.4 with averages of 11.9ppg 3.9rpg 1.7apg on 52% FG, 34% threes and 71% FT efficiency in 21.5mpg.  Giddey has a cumulative PER of 15.9 PER with averages of 13.9ppg, 7.3rpg 5.7apg on 46%, 31% and 75% in 28mpg.  Statistically, these guys are a wash.  So it can't both be the case that trying to acquire Kuminga for Caruso, was delusional because Kuminga is just that damned good while getting Giddey instead is a disaster for the Bulls.
* **Letting Drummond walk and signing Jalen Smith**.  Drummond was a unique player with his mixture of off the charts historically unbeatable rebounding, his ability to steal passes from the wing and start fast breaks, and his mediocre marksmanship around the hoop combined with inept FT shooting.  The Bulls will certainly miss his bag of glaring strengths and weaknesses and they could have gotten some second round draft picks if they had traded him at the trade deadline.  But Jalen Smith is a pretty good under the radar singing, as he can play inside and outside, making him potentially more of a modern big than Drummond was.   He could well develop into a starter by the time that Vuc is phased out.  Over 207 career games, he holds per 36 minute averages of 18.7ppg, 11.4 rpg and 1.5 bpg on solid 52%, 36%, and 74% shooting.  He's not going to be Drummond on the glass (Drummond has a career 16.4rpg average per 36 mins), but he's got good potential and a high enough floor already.  He was 23 years old last season and Drummond was 30 so again the Bulls get younger.
* **Drafting Matas Buzelis at 11th in the past draft**.  The Bulls held the No. 11 pick, which seemed nowhere near high enough to nab Matas Buzelis, who was commonly mocked near the top five.  Yet the 6'10"" forward, who just so happens to hail from the Windy City, fell right in their laps.  Of course, there are reasons why Buzelis fell in the draft, as there are concerns about his frail frame and his 3-point shooting but this still feels like a solid pick.  Buzelis will need to improve his three-ball and bulk up and try to get the hang of NBA defenses.  He scored 9.3ppg on 35% FG and 29% threes in the preseason.  I can definitely imagine efficiency being an issue for him his rookie season.  But it is potentially a pretty good pick.  Again, an injection of youth with solid potential.  In my mind, Buzelis' closest potential career comparison might be AK-47 Andrei Kirilenko a wiry tall forward who was a perennial starter who could score inside and out while blocking shorts and rebounding some.
* **Resigning Patrick Williams to a 5 year $90 million deal**.  This one is tricky.  While I'm still glass half full on P-Will, he's had some real injury issues so far in his career.  He's definitely got the talent and a career average of 9.7ppg and 4.2rpg in 27.3 mpg on 47% FGs, 41% threes and 78% FTs says he's not just vague potential but a contributor at least.  But of course, you'd want more than that at this point from a former nr. 4 pick.  Much more. He's still only 23 years old so I'm going to remain glass half full.  But the ""soreness"" Williams experienced recently is a bit concerning.  So was P-Will's lackluster preseason showing.  I guess we'll just have to see.  Williams is one of the very few players on this roster with some actual defensive bonafides and the Bulls project as a potentially terrible defensive team.
* **Other moves**.  The Bulls signed Talen Horton-Tucker and he made the opening night roster. A pretty good signing if preseason is any guide, which it often isn't.  The Bulls let Bitim go, which is probably ok since he has had a total of one good NBA game, his very first one.

Let's look at the roster now.

1. **Guards / Wings**

The Bulls have one of the deepest, most talented and most interesting guard/wing rotations in the league with Giddey, Zach, White, Dusunmo, Terry and possibly even Ball, especially if Giddey starts to hit his stride.  Chris Duarte is a pleasant luxury to have as a likely third stringer.

I feel that Zach will have a bounce back year.  I think Zach wants to prove that he's capable of winning.  When you've been an All-Star multiple times, what else is there to do? He's said all the right things and he had a good preseason.

White was runner up for MIP and he's turning only 25 this season.  Ayo is only 30 days older than White.  It's possible either player could still hit a higher level in terms of production and/or efficiency.

Speaking of Ayo and efficiency, he was [one of only 7 players](https://www.statmuse.com/nba/ask?q=players+with+50%25+field+goal+percentage%2C+40%25+3pt+percentage%2C+and+80%25+ft+percentage%2C+playing+more+than+50+games+in+2023-24) who shot over 50% FGs, over 40% threes, and over 80% FTs last season while shooting a decent number of threes.  Interestingly, in the 3 games White missed, Ayo put up 21ppg and 7.7apg against just 2.1 TOpg on 50% FGs, 39% threes, and hit 7 for 7 from FTs, suggesting he could well have another gear if given the chance.  If you watch him, he rarely takes bad shots.  He also seemed like Chicago's only fast break option last season and, if the current focus on up-tempo plays holds true, that could well play to Ayo's strength.  I predicted last season that Ayo could easily average 15-20ppg on an up-tempo team so this could be Ayo's breakout season (last season already sort of was).  He already averaged 15.4ppg in 37 games last season as a starter while the Bulls were slowing things down.

It's reasonable to imagine White being more efficient if he doesn't have to lead the NBA in minutes played per game.

Ball is just a feel-good story and will be one of the more intriguing stories to follow this season.  He's coming back from a one-of-a-kind injury in the NBA.  I doubt he'll play in back to backs and I see the Bulls resting him from time to time.  Still, the way he played in the preseason, I continue to maintain that the Bulls would have been a solid playoff team in the East if they could have kept their big 4 healthy.

Then there's Dalen Terry.  I wouldn't entirely sleep on him.  He's a stat sheet stuffer with 10.7ppg 6.0rpg 4.1apg 1.5spg and 0.9bpg per 36 mins in 97 games.  At his best, he's like a Mini-Pippen, a tall ball handling guard/wing who can pass and play defense.  That said, he will only be a marginal player if he can't get his three ball under control (23.8% career).  But at 22 years old and under team options through next season, there's still some time to see what he can do.

At this point, Jevon Carter is just a mistake. But he's probably just the 4th or 5thy string PG at this point. I could see the Bulls occasionally throwing him out onto the court to see if he can develop any semblance of trade value.

**2. Forwards**

The forward situation is Chicago's major weakness.  Still, one could easily see it developing into a strength over time if things go right and fall into place.  That's a big ""if"" however...

Zach would likely start at SF due to the crowded and talented backcourt situation.  I also see Ayo and Terry seeing some time at the 3.

Beyond that, the Bulls have the enigmatic Patrick Williams who can play either forward.  He scored 11ppg 4.4rpg on 45% FGs and 39% threes in 30 games as a starter last season, coming back from one of the most horrible beginnings to the season that a player has had in recent memory. Respectable but hardly spectacular numbers.  Again, he doesn't have to be the next Kawhi Leonard, but the way is open for him to develop into a solid starter who plays both ends. My bet is still on this happening.

Matas Buzelis and Julian Phillips provide intriguing options.  I believe Buzelis will prove to be a good pick over time.  But it's a question whether he can hit over 40% FGs and 30% threes his rookie season or whether his shot blocking actually translates into good NBA defense.

Phillips had a successful preseason after being limited by injury late last season.  He was already showing hints of being a decent rotation player last season, and he can bulk up a bit, he could develop into something interesting.  He came to Chicago at a cost of two seconds, but it could end up being worth it.

Torrey Craig is still around to provide depth and can start in a pinch at either forward if necessary.

The Bulls will obviously miss Javonte Green's energy and efficiency.

A rotation of P-Will, Julian Phillips, Craig, rookie Buzelis and Dalen Terry, really won't scare anyone in the NBA.  But it will likely be shored up with Zach and Ayo seeing time at the 3 and possibly Jalen Smith occasionally at the 4.  There's potential for the younger players to hit their stride and break out, so while forwards are a major weakness, it will also be one of the more intriguing positions to watch in terms of the Bulls' future.

**3.  Centers**

The biggest issue with Vuc last season was his three-ball.  That said, he got better at it as the season went on.  My money is on him shooting better this season.  His career TS% of 54% leaves a lot to be desired and he's never been a stud on defense.  But he was good for 17.7 PER even in his bad season in '23, so he's doing some things right.

Jalen Smith could be the solution and could make Vuc redundant if he plays well enough.

I'm glass half empty on Adama Sanogo.  He's a one trick pony, a rebounding machine, who doesn't really do much of anything else.  In 66 minutes last season he had 0 assists and 5 turnovers (0.7apg vs. 2.2 tpg in G-League). 14 of 27 FGs and 8 of 12 from FTs in the NBA while going 1 for 2 on threes in 16 G-League games, is Drummond like offensive efficiency, and that's not a compliment.  At 6'9"" he's got PF size, but with no ability to stretch the floor.  What he does do, rebounding, he does it well.  And more than half of his NBA rebounds came on the offensive glass.  So he definitely does have an NBA skill.  In that sense, he seems like a very solid 3rd string center.  But I'll be pleasantly surprised if he becomes anything more than that.

It doesn't look like a particularly great rotation in the middle, but it could be serviceable.  

**How to Enjoy the Coming Season**

With the Bulls 1st round draft pick hinging on it being top 10, it's going to be an interesting season and I can see Bulls fans arguing with each other whether wins are ""worth it"" and whether there is such a thing as ""good losses"" and so on as the games play out.  That can make for a potentially frustrating season as some fans try to ""root for losses"" and the Bulls have to try to navigate this challenge.  But there's a lot to be hopeful about and several reasons why this season could be exciting.  Here's what Bulls fans should do in my opinion:

* **Enjoy the Magical Uncertainty of the Season**.  I understand the argument for tanking, especially with the Bulls' draft pick on the line, but some fans wanted the team to tank harder last season and to ""blow it up"" more, but the Bulls still managed to land a good draft pick despite finishing in the play-in.  So the Bulls kind of enjoyed the best of both worlds at least in a small way: seeing Coby White put up 42 points in a play-in game, while still getting the practical effect of tanking by landing a coveted player in the draft.  Hell, Atlanta was in the play-in and also managed to nab the number 1 pick.  Meanwhile, Charlotte had an absolute disaster of a season which seriously tested their fans' patience, but ended up with only the 6th pick.  Sure, you'd want the 6th pick rather than the 11th, but considering how much suck the Hornets fans had to endure, was it really worth it?  Part of the reason the Hornets sucked, aside from injuries, was because they simply sucked and part of that suck could very well translate into sucking this season too.  So, I'd encourage fans to just try to enjoy things for what they are rather than seeing everything in black and white, seeing every win as a curse or claiming the franchise will be ""doomed"" if the Bulls end up in the play-in.  Yes, losing the draft pick wouldn't be a positive and that's a scenario best to be avoided, but it wouldn't ""permanently cripple"" the franchise or anything like that.  Look at the endless gloom and doom media talk last season, claims that the Bulls have ""no future"" and so on, and look where the Bulls are today.  No, they aren't an up-and-coming team with an all-world franchise talent like the Spurs and their rebuild still feels a bit undercooked, but there are some reasons to be intrigued or be excited about this season and about the future, with Matas, White, Ayo, Ball's potential bounce back, and seeing how talented veterans like Zach and Vuc can fit into all this.  Let's also not forget that the Bulls could end up in a play-in and even keep their pick (Atlanta!)
* **Root for the development of the younger players**.  Matas is obviously at the top of the list, but if P-Will finally takes that next step, the Bulls could end up looking like a different team entirely.  As mentioned, there are reasons to be optimistic that both White and Ayo aren't done making strides.  Julian Phillips and Dalen Terry could easily be the next Ayos this coming season.  Of course, the Bulls won't hit on all of its young players, but I'm betting they will hit on at least some. There will likely be some pleasant surprises this season for sure.
* **Watch Ball make History**.  Nobody has come back to play in the NBA from an injury like that.  That's going to be an amazing story.  I definitely expect the Bulls to rest Ball in back to backs, and maybe even at times in general.  And he could easily have a temporary or permanent setback at any point, but let's just enjoy his come back for what it is while its going on.  He flashed a little bit of his former brilliance in the preseason and that was just heartwarming.  No idea where the Bulls go with this, with Ball being in the last year of his contract, but one could imagine them bringing back Ball on a sweetheart contract if he can somehow make it through the season in one piece. He could also be included as trade bait to help move a vet.
* **Hope the Vets can Bounce Back**. Ideally, you'd want both Zach and Vuc to have bounce back seasons which would mean Zach staying healthy and playing team ball and Vuc rediscovering his 3-ball.  Of course, if Zach and Vuc play better, that could raise the risk of the Bulls losing their 10th pick, and that's the real dilemma of the season.  But it could also increase the chance that either player could get moved without the Bulls having to attach young assets to them.  I'm hoping for a situation where somehow both players make it through the season and sign on to the Bulls bright future, but that's probably too much to hope for.

**My Prediction**

I guess **30-35 wins** sounds about right this season, but I could see the Bulls surprising on either side of that prediction if things fall into place or if things totally fall apart.  If the younger players develop, Ball stays on the court, Vuc finds his outside shot and Zach plays team ball at an All-Star level, it wouldn't be inconceivable to see this team in the hunt for a playoff spot.  But there are also many scenarios where things become unhinged.  After losing their best defender, their best rebounder and their most consistent offensive player, the Bulls could be in trouble.  Zach could let the trade rumors get to him and end up in a gloomy funk.  Ball could have a setback 5 games into the season.  And the young players could take a long time to develop.    But that could end up with the Bulls having a higher lottery pick, which is one of the goals of a rebuild anyway.  So things really aren't all that bad.  It's time to sit back and enjoy the season.

2024-07-17,1721189199,A Historical Perspective on the DeRozan Trade,"I'm growing increasingly frustrated with the local coverage regarding the Bulls recent trade where they sent Demar DeRozan to the Kings so I've decided to provide you all with a little history lesson:

June 9th, 2015 Vlade Divac, the newly appointed Vice President of Basketball Operations for the Sacramento Kings trades Carl Landry, Nik Stauskas, and Jason Thompson along with a 2017 unprotected pick swap and a 2019 1st Round Pick. 

In exchange the Kings receive two euro league prospects who never made it to the NBA. Effectively this trade was a cap dump. The Kings cleared approximately 15.25 million dollars in cap space which they used to sign free agents Rajon Rondo, Kosta Kufos, and Marco Belinelli. 

It is later reported by Zach Lowe that the Kings could have kept both of their picks and signed at least 2/3 desired free agents if they had instead used the [Stretch Provision](https://www.slamonline.com/news/nba/cba-explained-the-stretch-provision/) on the aforementioned Landry, Stauskas, and Thompson, however, Divac did not know what the stretch provision was. 

The 2019 1st Rounder turns into Romeo Langford.

The 2017 Swap turns #5 Pick DeAaron Fox into #3 Pick Jayson Tatum. 

The Bulls in 2024 are approximately 4.7 million dollars below the luxury tax line. If they had chosen to do so they could have used the Stretch Provision on Lonzo Ball and they would have enough space to absorb Harrison Barnes' contract, acquire an unprotected 2031 1st Round Pick Swap with the Sacramento Kings, and stay below the luxury tax line. 

Don't tell me that pick swaps don't matter: THEY DO. 

Don't tell me about cap space in 2025: when you factor in Giddey's Cap Hold they will not have any. 

Bulls fans need to realize that this is not the usual bad front office that we are used to having. They are historically inept and the only thing we can do is stop giving them our money.

2024-04-18,1713423717,Ayo's shooting/overall development,"Ayo's development this year has been amazing, especially shooting-wise. He made 0.7 3s per game last year on 31.2% and now on the year he is hitting 1.6 per game on 40.3%. That is an insane leap. And if you look at since that bucks OT win when our team turned it around, he's hitting 1.8 per game on 40.8%. The fact that he was awful from 3 last year and now he has the confidence to pull up in transition off the dribble, as well as release it quickly on catch and shoots is pretty crazy.

Not to mention since that bucks OT win, he's averaged 14.1 ppg, 3.7 apg, 1 spg, and he's shooting 50.5% from the field. And of course we know he's turned into a 1 man fast break.

It's not often you find do it all guards like him that don't need the ball in their hands (good defense, good passer, decent ballhandler, good shooter, great in transition). If he keeps this up, and keeps developing, he can be a starter for a long time. He could improve on his isolation scoring/midrange, finishing at the rim, and keep working on his handle, but he's already a very good role player in general.

I was pretty down on him after last season, but I'm glad he's proved me wrong this season and is looking like a key piece in the future. Great mentality and seems like a great teammate.",chicagobulls,25,https://www.reddit.com/r/chicagobulls/comments/1c6x09g/ayos_shootingoverall_development/

2024-06-21,1718932287,(OKC fan) here to shed light on giddey,"I understand that most people may not like giddey or feel like he was a waste of a trade. Im not here to convince or debate. I just wanted to shed light on giddey and say he was playing the wrong position on the Thunder for the past three years. (Mainly because he didnt fit our lineup.) 

Heres a look at his stats when he is the point guard and is given the keys 

Josh Giddey has averaged:
20.6 PTS 7.9 AST 8.6 TRB 0.8 STL .49 FG% .28 3PT% 0 +/- 

PER 36 MIN over 19 games

This is based on the past 2 seasons when our best player (Shai) was out, and Giddey was running PG

Hes not a perfect player, however hes young and he has a lot of potential assuming your coach will use him properly. Keep in mind he was between 19 and 21 these years. And just got his minutes, dropped and had the whole fanbase on his ass with legal allegations.

2023-11-27,1701096214,"[K.C. Johnson] AKME and Billy Donovan's jobs are likely safe, although Donovan's staff could be tweaked moving forward","[Source (K.C. Johnson via NBC Sports Chicago)](https://www.nbcsportschicago.com/nba/chicago-bulls/bulls-poor-start-is-collective-failure-but-burden-of-change-to-fall-on-players/521200/)

Full quote: 

&gt;From managements roster vision to coaches schemes and messaging to players execution, theres plenty of blame to divvy up among the Chicago Bulls.

&gt;The odd part is: Typically in such circumstances, a coach may be on the hot seat or perhaps management could be in trouble. But with Jerry and Michael Reinsdorfs history of employing Jerry Krause for 18 years and John Paxson for 17 until Paxson initiated his exit plan, not to mention Artkras Karniaovas contract extension, Karniaovas has been given the green light to try to fix the current mess.

&gt;Same goes for Billy Donovan, who is liked and respected by both ownership and management and also has multiple years left on his extension. While it has happened in recent situations like Fred Hoiberg and Jim Boylen, the Reinsdorfs typically dont like paying coaches not to work for them. So Donovan is safe, although it wouldnt be a surprise to see his staff tweaked moving forward.

&gt;That leaves the burden of change falling on the players. And they know it.",chicagobulls,127,https://www.reddit.com/r/chicagobulls/comments/1854j9k/kc_johnson_akme_and_billy_donovans_jobs_are/

2024-04-20,1713596019,Sure glad we didn't get 2 seconds and likely 2 firsts for Drummond and Caruso,"The 2 2nds was confirmed, bulls had an agreement  but balked last minute and asked for 3 for Drummond. 

Caruso easily could've gotten 1 first if not 2 mid to late firsts at the deadline. 

But that one play in game was soo worth it. Thanks Jerry and AKME !



Fwiw, excited to see coby improve but really don't see him, ( let alone pat or ayo ), becoming a no 2 option on a championship level team. With coby i can talk myself into it if Bulls got absurdly lucky to get a legit mvp caliber no 1 guy.  

ESPN article focuses on Bam guarding demar as if that was the key to the game. Demar was the best player on the bulls, 22 points on 8-16 and was making good passes, not turning the ball over. 

Meanwhile Vuc is guarded by 20 y old 205 lb Nikola Jovic, and gets only 1 offense board, and scores 16 on 17 points. He did get a lot of boards but thats because he tries to stat pad rather than let guards rebound and push on the break. 

Maybe he could be a helpful player on a different team, but he is just not worth 20 mil next year at 34 and 35. He's allowing 64% within 6 feet of the rim and 55% on 2s. 

Zach lavine has probably never had lower trade value in his entire career even post acl tear. Knowing bulls they will get a stellar return just like for lauri (not saying Zach will be as good post trade, but he had multiple 25ppg 50 40 80+ seasons on a high volume of 3s, just saying in terms of selling low).

Here's to running it back and chasing 42 next year.

(No matter what still my fav sports team and will always root and hope for the best so forgive me for being a wet noodle, I just don't have a lot of optimism)

2023-12-25,1703544204,Patrick Williams- Winning Player,"I am wondering why the Bulls play so much better when he is on the court. This year he has a net rating of +3. The leaders of the team Derozan, Vucivic, and Lavine all have very large net negative ratings with Lavine being one of the worst on the team at -8.

Patrick Williams stats do not seem overly impressive, so I am wondering if anyone has theories for why the data is showing him as such a positive on the court. Some chance that it is just too early in the season to say anything and this is just noise, but I think this stat is likely telling us something.

&amp;#x200B;",chicagobulls,39,https://www.reddit.com/r/chicagobulls/comments/18qt0e3/patrick_williams_winning_player/
2023-12-19,1702958861,Too much Demar hate if the goal is to win now,"I think it's pretty obvious this bulls team (without Lavine) is showing we can compete for a play-in spot forsure, and at least a 7-8 spot despite our awful start. Now some people might want to completely blow it up and hand it over to coby/pat/young guys for their development, and that's fine. But if we want to compete this season, Demar gives us a much better chance of winning with him than without having him imo.

Any trades we make will not replace the ballhandling/playmaking/scoring that he provides us currently. And he's shown a lot of willingness recently to adapt his game. Since lavine has been out, he's averaging about 7 assists. Not to mention he's making 1.3 3PMs per game on 37.5%. His defensive effort, while not perfect, also seems better. Averaging almost 1 steal and 1 block.

Yes he deserves criticism sometimes when he gets blinders on hunting his shot despite the whole defense collapsing on him, and this does hinder the new ball movement style we have been playing at times. But at the same time, good teams need guys that can iso to consistently get buckets and draw free throws. And the offense can look rough when he's not there as a safety valve when others get cold. 

He is also the most reliable ballhandler on our team imo, even moreso than coby even with how great coby has been. He's probably the most skilled passer too, just doesn't have playmaking mindset/playmaking IQ coby does so he's not as good of a playmaker as coby has turned into. He takes a lot of pressure off coby though in this regard, handling the ball and absorbing defensive pressure.

I hope he will continue to buy in/adapt, and his efficiency will continue to improve, but I think some deficiencies of our team will be exposed if we get rid of demar and we will become less competitive. And again if your priority as a fan is the development of our young guys and this new style, then that's fine, I get why you'd want to move off him. But if you want to win, which personally I do with how we've been playing as of late, I think demar is still a key cog in this team that does more good than bad. 

I really like this sweet spot we have found lately with lavine out: Having our young guys step into much bigger roles so they continue to develop, but not getting rid of our vets like vuc and demar so that the pressure isn't completely all on our young guys, and the competitiveness is still maximized.

I'm a big Bulls fan, but this guy is a bum right?

  
I think the team could be better than the sum of its part if not for Vuc. 

  
Coby White had a break out year last year, Caruso was a generational defensive talent, DeMar always put in effort ... but then you got Vuc just giving no passion, being totally unremarkable and just killing any roots of shimmers of hope among the team. 

I honestly thought our team last year was pretty decent barring Vuc (starters wise, even I can concede we have the bench depth of a half dried puddle). 

I found myself screaming at my TV every time he attempted a 3 point shot, in the 2023-24 season he had 29.4% accuracy from 3pt range.

Lauri Markkanen = 39.9%

Nikola Jokic = 35.9%

Joel Embiid = 38.8%

He is currently an unrestricted free agent. The only time this can be OK is if it's a star player looking for a max contract and the previous team can do a sign and trade. But Demar isn't that. So why would he seek a cheap contract with a team who is trying to make sure they keep their top ten protected pick in the draft?",chicagobulls,76,https://www.reddit.com/r/chicagobulls/comments/1dlvya3/demar_is_gone_right/

Highlights

Trade Status:

Siakam: big payout because Indy cant sign anyone outright in free agency. KC loves the move. Good fit with Hali. 

Dont be surprised if Zach doesnt get traded at deadline. Hes definitely getting moved at some point, but the team is in no hurry to get peanuts back if theres no value at the deadline 

Bulls dont want to move Caruso unless theres a gangbuster offer

Team doesnt want to move Demar. Good locker room guy, and doesnt have much trade value. Bulls likely will be looking to extend him. 

Performance:

KC predict 43 wins. 

Bulls are 10-3 in clutch games since ZL went down to injury. Bulls are first in the league in defensive rating in the clutch. Bulls have played the most clutch minutes in the league at 101 minutes. 

KC likes Zach. Said he needs to get back to 15-17 shots a game; do what you do well. Hes playing like shit this year though. Shooting is down and decision making has regressed. 

Since Zachs return good defense. Told Coby Im just here for your development, which KC says is indicative of a good teammate. 

Vucs 3 ball is atrocious this year. Worrisome because its not just early season slump at this point. 

Dalen Terry is shooting 19.4% from three& Yikes

Offensive pace is dead last and its not close. 
Uptick in 3 pt. Attempts. 
Overall, the offense sucks. Exact same as last year. Defense has regressed as well. 


Of the big 3, whos impacting winning the most?
 Derozan, but its all been kinda underwhelming",chicagobulls,150,https://www.reddit.com/r/chicagobulls/comments/19arglf/good_stuff_from_kc_on_bulls_talk_podcast_zach/

&gt; There will be no Zach LaVine-to-Detroit trade now that LaVine has opted to undergo season-ending surgery on his left foot, but Bulls center Andre Drummond continues to generate considerable interest from various playoff-bound teams looking to add a proven center to the roster.

&gt; Drummond is averaging 7.7 points and 8.3 rebounds in just 15.8 minutes per game this season in Chicago while playing on an extremely modest $3.4 million expiring contract. The Bulls could be moved to trade Drummond for draft capital given that hes right there with Utahs Kelly Olynyk  highly coveted given his experience and rebounding ability in a similar vein to Olynyks appeal as a floor-spacer  in terms of in-demand big men.",chicagobulls,55,https://www.reddit.com/r/chicagobulls/comments/1aix9w9/stein_andre_drummond_continues_to_generate/

2024-09-21,1726891301,What we know about the new Chicago Sports Network,"(Feel free to take this down if needed, Ive made a lot of posts already but I wanted to compile it into one singular post)

1. This is a new regional sports network

2. NBC Sports Chicago, formerly
Comcast SportsNet/Fox Sports Net will cease to exist at the end of the month

3. If you are out of market, you can still watch on league pass. This channel only really matters to those of us in market

4. Speaking of market, that doesnt change. The designated home market as it stands now with NBC Sports: Illinois (except southern counties in STL metro), NW Indiana (seems like CHSN will be expanded to all of Indiana), Iowa, Southern Wisconsin and Southwest Michigan

5. For the first time since the WGN days, all locally televised Bulls games will be free to watch over the air, via an antenna. The channels in Chicago will be 62.2 and 62.3, subchannels of WJYS The Way. It was also announced initially that there were carriage agreements in Rockford on WSLN-TV and in South Bend, IN on WNDU-TV, but those are no longer listed on the official CHSN website. More affiliates are supposed to be announced before launch, and like I noted before, it looks like this channel will be in all of Indiana now as opposed to NW Indiana. How that will work with Pacers games, I have no idea. It also looks like this channel will be in St. Louis, Missouri as shown in one of CHSNs videos at the very end where it looks like they show the broadcast map.

6. Stacey and Adam and back, this doesnt affect them. The only one from the old Bulls crew not returning is Will Perdue

7. As of right now the only carrier to agree to broadcast it is DirecTV, taking over the same channels NBC is currently on. Dish isnt expected to be pursued. Id say Fubo has a good shot of getting it, and I highly doubt YouTube TV or Hulu are getting it at this point, they dont carry any RSNs except for NBC ones.

8. Finally, no app announced as of right now. It would be insane not to have one while the only carrier who has them is the most expensive in DirecTV, but maybe theyre waiting to announce it closer to the regular season.


I wanted to make this mega post compiling everything we know into one place. A big source of confusion is the lack of info around this, a lot of other teams have moved to free television as well this past summer and have way more info out than CHSN does right now. 

We have just over a week until launch. I hope next week we know everything about it, but for now, this is what weve got. ",chicagobulls,91,https://www.reddit.com/r/chicagobulls/comments/1flujyn/what_we_know_about_the_new_chicago_sports_network/

Full Quote:

&gt;With a week remaining before the NBAs trade deadline, few within or around the Chicago Bulls organization anticipate the franchise making a major move.

&gt;If the Bulls swing a deal before the Feb. 8 deadline, most will be surprised. Its not that the Bulls cant make a trade, but theres a prevailing belief that the front office wont commit to something substantial.

&gt;The Bulls are clinging to  and perhaps overvaluing  their most attractive asset (Alex Caruso), drawing little to no interest in their most talented and highest-paid player (Zach LaVine) and might be stuck paying pricey, aging veterans (DeMar DeRozan and Nikola Vuevi).",chicagobulls,194,https://www.reddit.com/r/chicagobulls/comments/1aflgkh/mayberry_with_a_week_remaining_before_the_nbas/
2023-11-16,1700117198,Why aren't Bulls fans protesting Reinsdorf?,"Saw this CHGO clip of Matt Peck laying into the Bulls from Billy Donovan to AKME.  But his main target was rightfully Jerry Reinsdorf.  
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZF0faUDqZJc

I was born in the early 90's so I got to vaguely see the end of the Jordan era and I was hooked on the Bulls.  I stuck through the Tim Floyd years and fell in love again with the Scott Skiles/Ben Gordon Bulls and then of course the Derrick Rose/Jimmy Butler years.  These last few years, I stopped watching the team because I realized they were a hopeless franchise under Jerry Reinsdorf.  

My question is, why are Bulls fans letting this happen to them?  Why aren't people banding together and organizing protests outside and inside the United Center.  Why aren't people starting ""Sell the Team"" chants at games?  Why aren't fans organizing to buy billboards across Chicago and Reinsdorf's home in Arizona?  Does anyone think this would fly in cities like Philadelphia or Boston?  Why are we letting it fly in Chicago?

It feels like Bulls fans in general are just resigned to mediocrity.  The Bulls are gonna end up selling their players before the deadline, something that should have been done last year, and Bulls fans will fall in love with a young player they get in a trade or draft and we're gonna start the climb to mediocrity again.  Why are we letting this happen?",chicagobulls,95,https://www.reddit.com/r/chicagobulls/comments/17wgfuo/why_arent_bulls_fans_protesting_reinsdorf/

Coby, Patrick, Ayo, and Giddey are all entering into their nba primes in terms of age. 

Zach Lavine appears to be healthy and is only 29 years old. Say what you will about him, (I have) he is an efficient scorer on high volume when healthy. 

Lonzo Ball, if healthy, appears to be an effective player still. (Not saying hes that same dude) This is a big if, obviously, but health is a question for any team. 

Vuc isnt the worst center in the nba and does some good things out there. 

Jalen Smith is regarded as one of the better back up bigs in the association and provides us with some much needed spacing in the second unit. 

Terry, Phillips, and Buzelis are complete wild cards but each one of them has shown promise in terms of potentially being an nba caliber player. 

Billy isnt the worst coach Ive ever seen. Hes definitely not Jim Boylen who will actively harm our team.

&gt; With less than two weeks to go until the NBA trade deadline, this much can finally be said about Chicago's Zach LaVine:

&gt; A trade market, narrow but tangible, has finally emerged for the Bulls' former All-Star.

&gt; League sources tell The Stein Line that, while no trade is certain to be consummated, Detroit continues to maintain interest in LaVine.

&gt; And talk between the sides, sources say, have by no means gone dormant.

&gt; The Pistons are said to have established four of their young players as off-limits in ongoing trade discussions with various teams: Cade Cunningham, Jalen Duren, Jaden Ivey and rookie Ausar Thompson.

&gt; How firm is that stance? Would the Pistons relent on Ivey? Can Detroit assemble a trade package around the very trade-friendly contract possessed by Bojan Bogdanovi that the Bulls ultimately accept because they just want to get off of LaVine's contract after months of speculation on the matter?

&gt; Word is that the Bulls, to this point, have not shown an inclination to simply make the best deal they can with Detroit to move LaVine off their books.

&gt; The Bulls continue to make former All-Star swingman Zach LaVine available on the trade market but are not, league sources say, looking to ship out multiple veterans and enter into a full-fledged rebuild.

&gt; Potentially supporting such notions are the recent whispers that the Bulls have not completely ruled out using Lonzo Ball's insurance-covered contract in a trade to add talent.

&gt; Ball, who has been particularly missed by LaVine, last played in January 2022 and will miss this entire season because of ongoing knee issues. The 26-year-old holds a $21.4 million player option for next season that he is certain to exercise, but with 80 percent of Ball's contract covered by league-provided insurance because he's been out so long, Chicago wouldn't be paying out nearly that much if it simply opts to keep Ball.

&gt; Chicago likewise has the option to take on salary by trying to construct a deal with Ball's contract and a trade partner that would be looking to lower its payroll by acquiring Ball and inheriting the Bulls' insurance payments.

&gt; The Bulls certainly aren't known for such payroll-increasing moves, which inevitably invokes some believe-it-when-we-see-it skepticism, but it is a pathway for them to consider.",chicagobulls,125,https://www.reddit.com/r/chicagobulls/comments/191unst/stein_the_bulls_are_not_looking_to_ship_out/

2023-10-27,1698421853,"yall don't make sense, how is the ""player's only meeting"" a bad thing?","the thing that annoys me is that it was hardly a ""player's only meeting"". it was a bunch of dudes calling each other out and holding people accountable. in no way was this a structured meeting to talk shit about coaching (which is generally the reason for a players-only meeting). billy just gave them the floor to conflict-resolve the issues themselves which i respect.

""players only meeting"" is so stigmatized and carries a negative connotation to locker room issues. if there's any time to nip issues in the bud, why wouldn't you be happy that they're starting game one instead of waiting 40 games while zach and demar iso ball?

yall talk about not having any ""dogs"", and how ""we need pat bev to put these guys in line"". in my opinion, this shows we DO in fact have dogs. that our dudes ain't just standing around looking sad after a loss, they're pissed and they're standing up for themselves. i see this as a potential positive identity shift.

2024-10-24,1729737691,"Well, we got what we asked for. This is definitely the start of a rebuild, and I think I get it...","To preface, there's a lot of optimism fueling this but feel free to pick it apart.  
  
It's becoming more and more clear that you can't be one dimensional in the NBA. 2 way team ball players are the future. Iso heavy, and offense only players are becoming less impactful since they cut down on foul baiting.  
  
With that being said, if you look at our roster, especially the young core, they are all 2 way players. The least of them is Coby White but I'll take that exception. PWill, Ayo, JP, Terry, Matas, and Jalen are easily considered 2 way players. LaVine and Vuc are the last of the dying breed.   
  
Considering that, there is one clear play to be made.  
  
1.) It will hurt for a bit, but we have to showcase LaVine and Vuc to drive their trade value up. So they need minutes and plays called for them up until the trade deadline. Yes, that restricts minutes for the young guys, but maybe that's not such a bad thing when it comes to progressing them at a reasonable rate.   
  
2.) As mentioned, it gives time for the young guys to progress, mesh, and find their individual fit on the team and develop the team identity.  
  
3.) By then, we know what pieces we will need and what we can hunt for by trading LaVine and Vuc.  
  
4.) Ideally, as the young guys progress, their defense and 2 way ability will get better and hopefully make up for the glaring holes left by AC (already miss you) and Green (miss you too). But as a solid unit instead of depending on someone like AC to lock down half the court.  
  
5.) As we're doing all of this, if we suck, then we get that mystical tank season that y'all have been asking for.  
  
Rebuilds take years. We're going to have to live with that for a bit.",chicagobulls,116,https://www.reddit.com/r/chicagobulls/comments/1gasi0s/well_we_got_what_we_asked_for_this_is_definitely/

2023-11-17,1700261115,"[Fischer] LaVine and his representation hold several preferred landing spots.. Los Angeles Lakers, Miami Heat, Philadelphia 76ers...San Antonio Spurs and Sacramento Kings","Source: https://sports.yahoo.com/how-the-bulls-situation-with-zach-lavine-is-taking-shape-211644393.html

Full Quote: LaVine and his representation hold several preferred landing spots, such as the Los Angeles Lakers, Miami Heat and Philadelphia 76ers, league sources told Yahoo Sports, and each team has registered some level of interest in the Bulls guard. LaVine also has an eye on joining the San Antonio Spurs, sources said, in order to pair with rookie sensation Victor Wembanyama and reunite with head coach Gregg Popovich, who oversaw the 2020 Team USA outfit that LaVine helped win a gold medal in Tokyo. There are several other contending situations LaVine would welcome joining, sources said, one being Sacramento. The Kings signed LaVine to an offer sheet during his restricted free agency in 2018, albeit before this present front office regime took the reins in Northern California.

If Chicago does intend to start a complete teardown and makeover, then Bulls guard and defensive stalwart Alex Caruso could possibly net Chicago its greatest return of any player on the roster. 

The sense around NBA decision-makers is that Carusos contract  still with another season at just under $10 million for 2024-25, plus his malleability alongside most players  could generate a market that touches most of the league, championship contenders and inexperienced playoff hopefuls alike. 

The Bulls have already required multiple first-round picks for the 29-year-old veteran when opposing teams have asked about Carusos availability. If his number of suitors were to indeed match the breadth of teams that checked with Portland about landing Jrue Holiday this fall, its not unreasonable to expect Caruso to fetch the Bulls a similar price point of draft capital, as Holiday netted the Blazers both a 2024 and 2029 first-round pick.",chicagobulls,103,https://www.reddit.com/r/chicagobulls/comments/17xrdz8/fischer_lavine_and_his_representation_hold/

I don't want to watch a team of college kids get shit on constantly but fuck it, if this is the effort the team is going to put out there I honestly don't care if that's the only other option. I'll take it. I'd rather watch DeMar, Zach, and Vooch play hard, do cool shit, and lose by like 5. But to play like *this?* This is just unacceptable.

Their only job is to be entertaining to watch. They get paid millions of dollars, more money than everyone on this site will ever see, to play a children's game. The fact that they decide to not at least fullfill their end and provide an entertaining product is frankly unacceptable. 

So if they're not going to be fun then fuck it, bring in the teenagers to get blown out by 30 while they ""develop"" and slowly become headcases.

2024-06-26,1719401310,Why Josh Giddey sucked in his third year.,"I came back to watching the NBA when Giddey entered the league. I've watched every OKC game since Giddey started. I've been listening to a lot of the analysis, and a heap of it is as jacked as Josh's 3.

**Ball Handling**

His ball handling: He will straight up lose his handle and turn the ball over. He was a basic bitch when he entered the league. If he has full court pressure he can't use speed to accelerate past, so he will get held up.

The Bulls need to get a ball handler to bring the ball up the court. Get Giddey to catch and keep his dribble and then have the team in motion screening and cutting. His ball handling since entering the league has improved dramatically. It's still not great, but he keeps adding to his bag every year. 

**Shooting**  
He can't shoot the 3 off the dribble. He can't shoot the 3 period. His shot is jacked. He needs to rebuild his shot completely. His floater will become lethal the longer he plays. He can just shoot over the top of small guards. His finishing at the rim is sub par. He gets blocked a lot because he can't jump, so he needs to add some tools to avoid a straight up layup to finish against the big man, but put a smaller defender on him and he will straight up bully them to the rim. 

**Defense**

His defense is not as bad as it is made out, and it has improved heaps. Towards the end of this season he was stripping the ball more, and getting a few blocks. He will get blown by and he will get beat in the air. And for some reason his contest at the 3 point line seems to make the opponent's shot go in. But he's scrappy, and taller than most guards, he fills space on the court and plays a good brand of team defense. He needs to work on his athleticism and his dedication to the defensive end, and even though he said the defensive end was a lightbulb moment, he's on the record in the past as saying nobody wants to be THAT guy on the team and that he needed to get better. He has improved and will improve.

**Passing**

The guy passes his teammates open. He has the capability to consistently average 10 assists a game, especially if he becomes a spot up 3 point shooter. He is the best inbound passer you've ever seen and is cool as hell in the clutch.

**Rebounding**

Everybody sees his rebounding stats and says he is a great rebounder but most of those are from positioning and as a result of his size. He's not outrebounding anyone. 

**So why do I think he has all star potential ...**

In his first two years at OKC he was sharing in the responsibility of running the offence with a limited skill set and it helped to win OKC more games than they should have. They were giving Shai heaps of Iso, and then Josh was taking his share and connecting the team and creating an offence that was all ball movement and cutting. Then J Dub took a massive step this year. He became explosive, and developed an excellent 2 man game with Chet. So OKC would play the starting 5, with Shai on the court. Then Giddey and J Dub would sit. And then they would be subbed back in together and now J Dub is playing iso and a 2 man game with Chet. OKC moved away from an offence of sharing the ball which Giddey excels at. And when they gave Isiah Joe the start (who is a great 3 point shooter) things didn't get better with him off the court. As a matter of fact, OKC aren't playing Joe properly either because most of his 3s are difficult opportunities. 

That left Giddey on lineups that were iso heavy no matter what. He was sitting in the corner and Shai's an amazing player, but he's not the greatest passer. So Giddey wasn't getting heaps of reps from 3, and the ones he was getting intermittently he was missing. 

The other massive factor was the off court stuff. It smashed his confidence. He looked absolutely depressed for most of the season. He's getting booed every time he played an away game. He was getting heckled and called a pedo online and in person, and he had a criminal case hanging over his head, and potentially the end of his career and deportation. He looked like his nerves were failing him. It was like he couldn't concentrate on his game. Every miss and turnover looked to be compounding his loss of confidence. But the kid has some set of balls. He played every game. He showed up. He hit rock bottom and then he climbed out of it, which is a massive testament to his character. 

In his first 2 years he was passing to guys who couldn't hit shots, and he was in a sub optimal role in his 3rd. You surround this guy with shooters and they can expect bullets flying everywhere hitting them right in the pocket. He will make everyone around him better, and he has got so much potential to improve almost every aspect of his game. The reason he didn't come with picks is probably because he is a lot more valuable than most people give him credit for. 

So I guess now I'm a bulls fan. Don't expect perfection. He's still raw, he still turns the ball over, he still gets blocked, but if he fixes his 3pt shooting his whole game is going to open up and so is Chicago's. He's still building his frame out. He's 21. Just give him some time. If you want to see good team basketball, he's a solid acquisition.

2024-06-24,1719194197,Some Giddey thoughts &amp; stats from an OKC fan...,"I've heard plenty of people complain about how he got benched during the playoffs this year &amp; was set to come off the bench next season... but both of those things were solely a product of his situation in OKC.

Giddey is a phenomenal ball-handler, has court-vision that I have only ever seen in a handful of other players &amp; he's one of the best rebounding guards in the league. But he's never going to thrive as a SG/SF hybrid type or just backing up someone like SGA.

He needs to have the ball in his hands to create for the rest of his teammates. If you take that away from him... he isn't able to bring a lot of value to the team outside of his rebounding.

Trying to isolate what he brings in terms of stats, I ran a search on Basketball Reference for the following:

* guards only (PG or SG primary position)
* 20+ games played
* 4+ AST/game
* 4+ REB/game
* positive offensive box plus/minus
* positive defensive box plus/minus
* Assist Percentage &gt;25% (on teammates made FG when on the floor)

It only returned seven players:

Shai Gilgeous-Alexander  
James Harden  
Luka Doncic  
Donovan Mitchell  
Scottie Barnes  
De'Aaron Fox  
Josh Giddey

Giddey led that group in terms of rebounds/possession, was 3rd in assists/possession AND was 3rd in field goal percentage (47.5%). All while rarely being the primary ball-handler in OKC because of SGA. But he's still managed career per 36 numbers of 17.1 points, 9.2 rebounds &amp; 6.9 assists while sharing the floor &amp; playing out of position.

Assuming his new Bulls teammates knock down some shots when he finds them, don't be surprised if he approaches 20/10/10 next year. He might not get there (few ever have) but he gave me peak ""Westbrook triple-double"" vibes quite a few of times in OKC when SGA wasn't playing.

There are obviously a lot of variables when adjusting to a new team, coach, etc... but his talent is undeniable. And he could easily blossom into an All-Star in Chicago if the actually run the offense through him.

I know it hurts to lose a guy like Caruso, but Giddey is SO young &amp; has endless potential that was going to be unrealized in OKC. Here's to hoping the trade works out well for everyone involved on both sides!",chicagobulls,81,https://www.reddit.com/r/chicagobulls/comments/1dn290d/some_giddey_thoughts_stats_from_an_okc_fan/

&gt;The 13 individuals in the inaugural class are: **Michael Jordan, Scottie Pippen, Bob Love, Jerry Sloan, Artis Gilmore, coach Phil Jackson, coach and broadcaster and ambassador Johnny Red Kerr, original owner Dick Klein, general manager Jerry Krause, Toni Kukoc, Dennis Rodman, Chet Walker and assistant coach Tex Winter.** Each of these individuals either is in the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame or had their banners raised at the United Center or both.

&gt;The criteria to be honored for players is to have spent at least three seasons with the Bulls and retired from the NBA for at least three years, making significant contributions to team success and/or holding franchise records that have held up over time. Staff honorees must have made significant contributions to the franchise.

&gt;Beyond a halftime presentation on January 12, the Bulls will also hold a private gala at the United Center on January 11 honoring the inductees. Separately, fans will be able to experience the Ring of Honor through an atrium exhibit from January 10-12. A website also will launch in early January, and more information can be found at Bulls.com/RingofHonor.

Just felt like pointing this out since the team chemistry issues the first 19 games + a shooting slump to start the year for DeMar had convinced a lot of people that he was becoming washed. His stats the last 35 are pretty close to what he averaged all of last season, only difference is his USG% is now his lowest since the year before he became an all-star in 2012-13.  Hes also improving throughout the season despite leading the entire league in minutes per game at the age of 34 and second in total minutes played only behind Coby by 1 minute.

Sports)](https://sports.yahoo.com/how-the-trade-market-is-shaping-up-for-zach-lavine-lauri-markkanen-145142833.html)

&gt;The Bulls are still searching for the type of haul that a multi-time All-Star typically draws, which LaVine certainly is based on résumé: an established starter, plus a young player with upside and then first-round draft capital, according to league sources. Chicago has also attempted swapping LaVine for other All-Star players, such as pitching Cleveland on the concept of acquiring Darius Garland from the Cavaliers, sources said.

&gt;Even still, the Bulls order of operations, by all accounts, continues to prioritize moving LaVine first. That would leave a significant sample size of games to evaluate Chicagos updated roster before making further decisions on the trade status of other veterans such as DeMar DeRozan and Alex Caruso.",chicagobulls,134,https://www.reddit.com/r/chicagobulls/comments/18j33ca/fischer_chicago_has_also_attempted_swapping/

2024-09-06,1725599627,Opinions on Pau Gasol stint with the Bulls,"Hey! It's the offseason tand since iI'm missing Bulls Basketball, I thought about remembering some old seasons.

Since I'm a recent Bulls fan from another country (really started watching basketball in the 2021-2022 season), I didn't get to watch some ""eras"" of Bulls teams.

Now for the questions, what was Pau Gasol playstyle with the Bulls? Was he the 1st, 2nd or 3rd offensive option? Was he good defensively? What did the Bulls fan base think about him at the time of the signing and at the time he left? Did he enjoy the team and the city overall? Anything really!

I'm just really interested in FIBA legends!

Hes one of the most efficient players with the ball in his hands. A counter to that is someone might say his play style puts a cap on how good the offense can be. Personally I dont believe that since he was the first option on a top 10 offense (peaking at number 2 in 17/18) every season from 2013/14 until 2019/20.

Full Quote:

&gt;Daryl Morey and the Philadelphia 76ers do not want to give up a first-round pick ahead of the trade deadline, but would be willing to do so for a player like DeMar DeRozan if the Chicago Bulls were willing to deal the star, sources said. DeRozan, who is in the final year of his contract, is not expected to be on the move. Philadelphia is certainly operating as a team that is trying to maximize its championship outlook while also maintaining a level of stability and flexibility entering the offseason.

&gt;The Sixers are willing to pursue any player they believe will help them capitalize on Joel Embiid's best years. Morey is not one to sit around and let other executives dictate the moves his franchise can make.",chicagobulls,131,https://www.reddit.com/r/chicagobulls/comments/1ahduiw/siegel_the_76ers_would_be_willing_to_trade_a/

&gt; With Karniaovas admission that he sees what everyone---fans, broadcasters, writers---sees, change is coming. This roster wont look the same come late February and into next season. That, not chasing playoff or play-in games, is the main storyline to this season.

&gt; This will be Karniaovas second roster iteration after inheriting a rebuilding project and blowing it up to trade for Nikola Vucevic, Lonzo Ball and DeMar DeRozan---the latter two in sign-and-trade acquisitions---and sign Alex Caruso in free agency. He also drafted Patrick Williams, Ayo Dosunmu, Dalen Terry and Julian Phillips.

2023-11-13,1699884459,I was at the game yesterday and came away with a few observations.,"1. Being up close you really see how skilled these dudes are and the game is majority mental. Drummond literally hit 7 straight 3s during halftime. Like step backs and all. Lol these guys really are the 1% when it comes to this profession, bench warmer and all. 

2. Either Zach really enjoys driving to the bucket more than shooting 3s or he has no idea what an open 3 is. When youre up close you can see how much space he has sometimes and instead of letting it fly, he just pump fakes into nothing. A shooter of his caliber should let it go with just the smallest of openings.

3. Pat has ZERO confidence. There were times where he was open on the wing and DeMar was bringing the ball up and he legit just ran to the other side so DeMar could have open space to iso. A player that wants it and has confidence in their abilities would have clapped for the ball instantly. Hes playing to not mess up out there. The pressure has broken him. On the bench you can tell hes unhappy and just overthinking. The only way he succeeds is a change of scenery or whole new roster overhaul that forces him into a different mindset. 

4. Ayo is ready to take off. His energy is different this season. No fear at all. You can just see it. The total opposite of Pat. He doesnt care if he messes up, hes going to keep at it. If that shot stays consistent, watch out, you might just have a competent Zach replacement. 

5. Coby White is a winning player. After Caruso, I can honestly say hes the one player on the Bulls that I can see playing a vital part on a championship. Maybe not as a starting point guard but as a integral bench piece. Him and Caruso are the leaders of this team. They never stop communicating and talking. There was one moment right before halftime where Zach and DeMar were talking about something and Coby just grabbed both of them and basically took the reigns on the convo. Got a delay of warning and all lol but fr the game has totally slowed down for him and he has finally figured out how to do the small things that affect winning. Pretty proud of him!

Thats all I got folks! Super fun game and word of advice, dont go to the game with the in laws, they wont understand your passion lol after a few drinks I turned into Hubie Brown! =",chicagobulls,66,https://www.reddit.com/r/chicagobulls/comments/17ube76/i_was_at_the_game_yesterday_and_came_away_with_a/

2024-07-20,1721496390,Buzelis so far&thoughts?,"Through 4 summer league games Matas is averaging:

18.0 PPG 
4.3 RPG
 0.8 APG
2.3 SPG
1.8 BPG
2.3 TOV
34.7 FG%
25.0 3P%
72.7 FT%
2.0 PF

Everyone shoots like shit in the summer league. These numbers look similar to guys like Miles Bridges and Franz Wagner. 
(Also, Brandon Miller had a 2:7 assist turnover ratio the other day). 

However, I am concerned about his on ball defense. He has great defensive instincts but he seems very slow laterally and has been getting beat regularly. That paired with his thin frame and less than ideal wingspan will make it difficult for him to guard bigger players as well.

I do think Giddey is a good point guard for him. Both like to get out and run, I think Matas could dominate in fast paced transition offense.

Overall very very promising, Thoughts on Matas so far?

2024-01-23,1706018697,We Need To Talk About Extending Caruso. Now.,"How much more proof do you need? Last night was another great example of how much he impacts the game. When the refs took him out with those 4 fouls, the drastic change in Bulls play basically erased that huge lead. Just like many other games and it's only becoming more apparent.  
  
His defense has always been incredible but now that he's finally starting to get more minutes, it's starting to bleed onto the rest of the team. He sets the bar when it comes to defensive effort and is basically the soul of the team. Or at least what it needs to be.  
  
Now that his 3s are dropping consistently, he's arguably the best 3&amp;D player in the league now. I think it's very easy to take him for granted when he's out there literally guarding at least 1.5 players at all times and locking down their best offensive threat. Then on the other end, keeps the ball moving unselfishly and is ready to hit all the big shots.  
  
Thinking business, his stock is rising. Yes I know he's over 30 but that doesn't mean what it use to, ESPECIALLY with his playing style. We need to cash in now and recognize that we have a diamond here.",chicagobulls,123,https://www.reddit.com/r/chicagobulls/comments/19dp5hj/we_need_to_talk_about_extending_caruso_now/

2024-04-12,1712934758,"The Bulls offense is not up to par with the rest of the NBA - they rank dead last in a lot of important offensive stats, and next season will be more of the same unless necessary changes are made","Compared to the rest of the league this season, the Bulls offense is simply way too predictable. The NBA's team stats reveals a lot about the current state of the offense: 

* 30th in off-ball cuts per game

* 30th in off-ball screens per game 

* 30th in dribble hand-off actions per game

* 30th in transition possessions per game

The Bulls are quite literally dead last in almost every offensive stat that looks at player movement. Coupled with that is the fact that the Bulls are not generating enough looks in transition (also dead last). The offense relies on half-court possessions more than any other team in the league, yet also generates the least amount of player movement and actions out of those half-court possessions. 

A lot of the other teams in the NBA have a bag of offensive actions they like to go into to help gain leverage on the defense: usually a mix of pistol/21 sets, horns sets, delay/zoom action, spain pick-and-roll, and plenty more. From these comes a variety of flare screens, down screens, and overall a variety of movement in the offense that keeps the defense on their toes. 

As the data tends to back up, the Bulls are not generating that type of leverage on defenses at all. Their favorite action outside of standard pick-and-roll seems to be [this double screen action at the top](https://streamable.com/stxl1y). They also like to use these double screens as drag screens in transition quite often. The Bulls DO run a few zoom/DHO looks per game, but ultimately are still dead last in player movement stats due to running these things way less than the rest of the NBA.

**So how do the Bulls generate offense then?**

* 3rd in pick-and-roll possessions per game

* 2nd in spot-up possessions per game 

This more or less paints the picture. The majority of the offense is the Bulls running a pick-and-roll at the top with DeMar or Coby. The defense may or may not collapse on the ball-handler, and everyone else stands around waiting for a potential spot-up jumper. One issue is the Bulls do not grade well as a team on these shots. They are only 28th in 3-point shots made per game. Not every team is great at shooting threes, so you have to find other ways to make up for it and generate good looks. But the Bulls also do not get to the rim/free throw line at the rate you'd expect of a poor perimeter shooting team: 

* 16th in shot attempts at the rim 

* 18th in free throw attempts per game

In my eyes, this is directly a result of the lack of movement making it harder on themselves. There are so many actions the Bulls COULD be running to help them become a force at the rim, and in turn find more open perimeter shots (or at the very least get the defense unsettled so they can find another drive attempt). Instead, the Bulls find their shots elsewhere:

* 7th in shot attempts from 10-14 ft

* 2nd in shot attempts from 15-19 ft

* 5th in shot attempts from 20-24 ft

So in a league where the best teams are generating high-quality shots at the rim and from three, the Bulls generate most of their shots in this mid-range-ish to very-long 2PT area instead. This is not a sustainable way to play on offense at all, and exemplifies why the Bulls need to make some large changes at some point. For as long as this current core and coach stay together, this will be the result on offense.",chicagobulls,83,https://www.reddit.com/r/chicagobulls/comments/1c2bmy6/the_bulls_offense_is_not_up_to_par_with_the_rest/

2024-02-29,1709201050,The way of Onuralp Bitim,"Onuralp emerged as ""the golden boy"" in Turkey in 2016, his father was also a good basketball player in the local league. Anadolu Efes, the team that won the Euroleague several times, added him to its squad. 

But ""the golden boy"" couldn't make the explosion. Everyone gave up on him. Anadolu Efes released him.

 In 2019, he went to one of the mid-sized teams of the league. In 2020, everything stopped due to the pandemic, his club was on the verge of collapse, they couldn't even pay salaries to his players, and Onuralp was one of the players who couldn't get paid. Eventually his team went bankrupt and withdrew from the league. 

Then he went to one of the teams with the lowest budget in the league. The entire team's budget was only $1 million. But the team found a good spirit. Onuralp had an excellent season in 2022, they played in the Eurocup final with this small team. 

Onuralp was now 24 years old, he went to America as a Eurocup star, but he should have prove himself in the G-Leauge in 2023. While playing for the Windy City Bulls in the G-League, he averaged 14.2 points - 3.6 rebounds - 3.4 assists in 22 games. The Bulls signed him to a contract. 

Tonight he scored his first points in a NBA game against to Cleveland and made a good contribution by coming from the bench. It was truly a big night for Onuralp, it must have been the moment when all his dreams came true.

Maybe this story will now turn to the American Dream. Maybe the kid everyone gave up on could be a solid piece of an NBA team.",chicagobulls,19,https://www.reddit.com/r/chicagobulls/comments/1b2wv5h/the_way_of_onuralp_bitim/

**DLo** \- More like HellNo. 2 points on 1-6 shooting. Jesus that's bad. Dude was ass on defense and effort all night long. Lakers can't wait to get rid of this guy. NO THANK YOU.

**Austin Reaves** \- 21 points on 9-14. Honestly he played really well however we witnessed the reason he comes off the bench. DeMar abused him down the stretch. Literally targeting him on defense for easy buckets. He's basically a worse version of Zach Lavine, I hate to say it. He gave a lot of effort but he's such an obvious one way player.

Nah. Just... Nah. Nothing here excited me. Nothing. I hope the front office saw what I saw because if they did they'd be hanging up the phone when the Lakers call. Go find a better trade partner please!

**EDIT:** A lot of folks in the comment section are saying just give me Reeves and and the 2029 pick. I'd like to point out that Reeves had the worst plus minus of any player on both teams last night. By a WIDE margin too. Even the Lakers that had a horrible shooting night actually affected winning more than Reeves did.

I know, I know, one game doesn't mean anything and plus minus isn't the end all be all stat some make it out to be. But in this case, you really cant deny for every bucket Reeves gave the lakers he gave up an easy one to the Bulls and then some. 

He's a straight up liability on defense. How do you think we're supposed to win in the playoffs when teams can just target your guy like the Bulls did to him last night? I don't want that guy. Go get us pieces that actually fit what we're doing (two way dogs) or draft picks. Lots of draft picks. I understand we need salary filler for a mid season trade but come on, let's make the focus of the trade 2-3 FRPs please.

The Bulls were ranked as having the 2nd worst off-season in the league:

*Chicago, after trading both Caruso and DeMar DeRozan and not getting a first-round pick in either deal (and watching the San Antonio Spurs get the best asset, a 2031 pick swap from the Kings, in the DeRozan deal)*

The Thunder trading Giddey for Caruso was ranked as the 2nd best deal of the off-season:

*Right behind it was the Caruso deal for Oklahoma City, which saw one of the league's best perimeter defenders go to the Thunder without the franchise having to part with a single draft pick.*

*""Getting him without giving up a pick is crazy,"" an East scout said.*",chicagobulls,114,https://www.reddit.com/r/chicagobulls/comments/1ef2wuo/nba_offseason_survey_bulls_had_the_2nd_worst/

There were some seasons, particularly during the Skiles years, that I didn't miss a single game all season. I always felt like the teams tried and at some point, I just accepted that the Bulls would never be a legit title contender because it's not a free agent destination. However, the last few years, teams like the Nuggets, Bucks, Raptors have all won championships. OKC is #1 in the west. While the Bulls have always been cheap, I still felt like they tried to win. Not anymore. This organization clearly doesn't care. 

It's obvious all it wants to do is compete for a playoff spot and call it a day. No urgency. Nothing. At least I said when Jerry dies, things should get better, but his son has been running the team for years now, and he seems to be just as bad. What keeps you guys going as fans of this team?

But heres the thing. I also fucking love the entire bulls game experience. There are a lot of jobs on the line that arent players and coaches. 

So, because I cannot be a hypocrite and give this franchise my money any longer, consider this my heartfelt thank you to the Chicago Bulls/United Center staff. You will all be missed.

Thank you to Benny the bull. You are the best. Truly. Dunking to dancing to throwing popcorn to winning the hearts of all Bulls game attendees, thank you Benny.

Thank you to the OG McDonalds guys that wear the pull string extendable hoop gear. That shit looked heavy but everyone loved you all. Thank you.

Thank you to the luvabulls and the dancers and the cheer people and awesome old people dancers to the untouchable Jesse White Tumblers and all of you crazy athletic performers. You bring so much to the game day experience.

Thank you to the scoreboard people. I love having so many stats at a glance. We see you and we appreciate you.

Thank you to the video scoreboard/camera operating people. From the Dunkin races to the kiss cam to the OG best player introductions of all time!!!!!! Thank you

Thank you to the guy yelling Prrrrrrrrograhms heah!!!!!! as we enter the UC, in the most glorious Chicago accent, your voice made me feel home. It was a good thing. Thank you Chicago accent guy!

Thank you to the management that continues to hire a killer diversity of themed games and national anthem performers and halftime acts. A very excellent representation of Chicago. Bravo

Thank you to whoever hires the concourse entertainment. From the jazz combos to the earth, wind and fire cover bands to the face painting to the balloon guy, thank you.

Thank you for allowing us to take pictures with the Jordan statue and the 6 trophies. Ill never not stop and stare every time Im there. 

I know Im leaving people out. Add them.

Thank you Chicago bulls people. Your players/coaches/management/ownership all suck but we really like the rest of you. The games may have been up or down, mostly down, but the game day experience was always killer.

The Bulls should have just taken on Barnes' contract themselves and gotten that 2031 pick swap in the process. Of course, doing so, even with Duarte headed to a third team, would have taken the Bulls into the luxury tax, and paying the luxury tax is apparently untenable for this organization. A 2022 Forbes study showed that the Bulls had paid the 24th-most money in luxury taxes since 2001 despite playing in the league's third-biggest market. The Bulls also could have found ways to duck the tax during the season, which likely would have started with a Jevon Carter trade, as he is not a core member of the team anyway.

The irony of all of this is that as we speak, the Bulls are reportedly still looking for someone to take on Zach LaVine's contract in another trade.

Full Quote: I'm skeptical of this given the entire history of the franchise and their desire to constantly stay on a treadmill of mediocrity, but there has been whispers in recent days that the Bulls are really planning on moving younger, with the perplexing trade of Alex Caruso for Josh Giddey with no picks attached as part of that design.

As such, there's thought that DeMar DeRozan might really hit the open market. DeRozan remains one of the Clippers' backup plans in the event that Paul George departs, but with the likelihood of George opting in, the odds of the Compton native finally making it back to California diminish.

The Bulls are known to be looking to move Nikola Vucevic, along with the never-ending Zach LaVine saga. The Caruso trade both helps and hurts those efforts because Caruso's contract was a quality lubricant for teams willing to take on those contracts, which now isn't available.

But the Bulls also don't have to constantly try and pull more assets from interested teams in exchange for adding Caruso. He's off the board.

It's clear that either way the Bulls are positioning Coby White as the future of the franchise.",chicagobulls,162,https://www.reddit.com/r/chicagobulls/comments/1dpx8sw/moore_the_bulls_are_known_to_be_looking_to_move/

2023-11-28,1701212721,"Remember the ""Fire GarPax"" campaign from 2016-17? We need a ""sell the team"" campaign now.","I typed up a bunch of shit explaining the rationale for why this is necessary then deleted it because it should be self-evident to anyone who's been paying attention to the Bulls for at least a few years (and even more so to someone who's been paying attention for decades) and I'm bad at formulating arguments. (edit: I guess I ended up typing a bunch of shit anyway. whatever)

The Reinsdorfs are terrible owners and care more about profit than winning. Yeah obviously it's a business, but if the product sucks then why are we supporting it?

Remember, we're talking about the guy (Jerry) who threatened to move the White Sox (which he's said he cares about way more than the Bulls... can't find the quote someone pls halp) to Tampa in the 80s unless the city and state helped him fund a new stadium.

We're talking about the guy who will NEVER go into the luxury tax to fund a winning team (which is almost necessary in today's NBA) or spend a dime more than he has to.

We're talking about the guy who famously advised another baseball exec to finish in second place every year and [recently echoed that sentiment](https://chicago.suntimes.com/white-sox/2023/5/3/23709810/jerry-reinsdorf-truth-make-an-appearance-as-white-sox-struggle-rick-hahn-world-series-david-samson):

&gt; The most striking statement had to do with what he thinks the fan base wants in a team.

&gt; I think the important thing to fans is, while they want you to win championships, they want to know that when they get down to the last month of the season, you still have a shot, he said. Youre still playing meaningful games. If you can do that consistently, youll make your fans happy.

&gt; The discerning Sox fan will see in that quote shades of the advice former Marlins president David Samson said Reinsdorf once gave him.

&gt; I was 32 years old, in baseball for my first of 18 years, Samson said in 2019. And [Reinsdorf] said: You know what? Heres my best advice to you: Finish in second place every single year because your fans will say, Wow, weve got a shot, were in it, but theres always the carrot left. Theres always one more step to take. 

&gt; Samsons quote caused a huge stink. The Sox moved quickly to deny that Reinsdorf ever said such a thing, knowing that an owner who settles for second-best isnt a good look for a franchise. But Reinsdorfs comments Monday in front of a group of witnesses at the Milken Institute Global Conference sounded very much like what Samson insisted he once said.

Literally nothing is going to change until the Reinsdorfs sell the team. AK will get thrown under the bus. Billy will get thrown under the bus. The players will get thrown under the bus. Are they blameless? Are they faultless? Obviously not, but they're playing for an organization that does not care about winning and ultimately will not support them in doing so. The Bulls will either find a new GM (EVP of basketball operations whatever), a new coach, new players who will all meet the same resistance. (or maybe AK can go the GarPax route and get spared just for displaying loyalty to the throne)

Anyway, what the fuck? Why is anyone supporting this? The Oakland A's fans had a massive grassroots campaign recently urging their owner to sell the team. It didn't work, and the jerk-off is moving the team to Vegas anyway, but it got a lot of traction and visibility.

2024-09-29,1727621987,Roses jersey should be retired in Chicago,"Title says it all and I know most Chicago fans probably agree but nevertheless Ill explain why I think this.

Players that get their jerseys retired are usually influential in creating, or defining, a particular era in a franchises history; Kareem and Magic for the Lakers, Bird for the Celtics, Jordan for the Bulls even going as far as to say Dirk for the Mavs or Stockton and Malone for the Jazz.

The Jordan Pippen era of the bulls was defined by their presence and, therefore, totally earned the right to have their jerseys retired. They also happened to win a few rings together which cemented this further. 

Now, rings and playoff success arent the only indicator on whether a players jersey should be retired, take the aforementioned Malone and Stockton, so this raises the question of what qualities does a player require to have their jersey retired? 

Im not aware of the defining factors but, in my mind, rose ticks each box.

The main reason I think is, for a brief moment, he reignited Chicago with hopes of achieving the same glory theyd once achieved. Rose was, and still is, Chicagos Golden Boy. 

Thats why I think he should have his jersey retired. Not the accolades or the achievements but his influence on Chicago.

2024-06-21,1718992461,What your getting in Giddey...,"Greetings All, Thunder Fan here!

I'm not here to sow ill will or gloat, eg. Not discussing the parameters in the trade, but I wanted to give you a diehard Thunder Fans opinion of Josh Giddey...

Aside from the extracurricular ""activities"" that I'm sure you're all aware of, I'll be discussing Josh as a Player and Teammate.

Teammate: Josh, as far as I can tell, in all ways, he is a phenomenal Teammate and lockerroom guy. Always supporting his team, rooting for them and generally just an upbeat personality.

Passing: Josh is legitimately one of the BEST passers in the league and the BEST ""SLOB Wizard"" out there. SLOB Wizard = Sideline Out of Bounds Passer

You will 100% win a game or two next year simply based upon him making an unreal pass from out of bounds near the end of the game.

Rebounding: Very good rebounder for a guard. Good placement, and tougher than he looks to knock others out of the way.

Dribbling: Good handle, not great and can get himself into trouble at times by over dribbling.

Driving: A facet of the game for him to expand, as he can bully ball other point guards but needs to be a better finisher layup wise and he has a great floater.

Post-Up: He can post up smaller guards very well and pass out of it amazingly well with unnatural precision.

Shooting: Needs to be better. Not the bottom of the league, but has improved each year and if he becomes league average that will unlock the best version of himself.

Defense: Fairly slow, but when locked in will try very hard and can be an average defender (at best) if he remains focused but he can definitely be lackadaisical at times.

Overall: He is a good player, and definitely a lead guard with magical court vision. Give him the ball and he will make things happen offensively for the entire team. I'm, personally, wishing him (and y'all) all the best!

With the 3rd pick in the 2024 WNBA Draft, the Chicago Sky select.. Kamilla Mutumbo Cardoso from the University of South Carolina. 

Kamilla was the 2024 WBCA Defensive Player of the Year. 

Shes a 2x NCAA Champion(2022, 2024).

She also won the 2024 NCAA Tournament Most Outstanding Player award. 

Fun fact: During her senior year in high school, Kamilla averaged 24.1 points, 15.8 rebounds and 9.2 blocks per game. Yes, you read that correctly.

And of course ..

With the 7th pick in the 2024 WNBA Draft, the Chicago Sky select .. Angel Rodman Reese from Louisiana State University. 

Angel was a unanimous First Team All American in 2023. 

During that same year, she won an NCAA Championship. 

Angel was voted The Most Outstanding Player for the 2023 NCAA Tournament. 

Fun fact: Growing up, Angel used to play for a recreational league in Baltimore. She used to play above her age group and played for mens teams where she excelled as a PG. She went through two growth spurts and now plays as a Forward.

I really want to see the front office pick a direction this offseason. Either get serious about building a contender or start acquiring draft capital because what were doing is just wasting time currently. We wont be getting better finishing just outside the lottery every year.
