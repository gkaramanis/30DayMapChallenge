According to the Scottsdale Police Department, authorities were called out to investigate a disturbance in Scottsdale at around 2:44 AM -- and came into contact with Payne and another individual.

It's unclear exactly what happened next -- cops did not give any further specific details -- although the SPD says Payne was arrested on the scene and booked on one charge of refusal to provide a truthful name and one count of false report to law enforcement.

We're told the 29-year-old NBA player was released from custody a short time later.""

Its so striking how unique Embiids journey has been, from the very first moment.  On this team, he was literally learning English, learning American culture, and learning basketball  amongst a group of kids that had all been playing for much, much longer.  It is so rewarding as a fan of Joel to watch this video and know how things play out til now.  He was an afterthought on the end of the bench, a late bloomer exchange student surrounded by cant-miss prospects. 

It blows me away how fast life moved for Joel after he arrived. Transferring HSs, choosing Kansas, asking if he should redshirt!, getting drafted and sliding into Rihannas DMs, sitting 2 years with crazy injuries, losing his brother&

Shirley Temples, videos of him dunking before he was playing, the rookie year, ALL the crazy 6ers shit that happened to him& pick a year& Crazy. 

But just like in this video, he betters himself at a dizzying pace.  He is almost superhuman in his ability to learn and improve and adapt.  

He needs a chip to finish the story.  Most of us are more invested in this than what would be considered healthy.  Its the reason r/nba is so infuriating.  This man is worth rooting for.  The boy in the video is worth rooting for. I am so proud of him.  He has earned every good thing that has happened to him.

2024-04-10,1712760889,"The Sixers' 30-8 Record with Embiid, &amp; the Absurdity of This Injured Season","I heard on the Mismatch Podcast Chris Vernon saying that the Sixers were 28-7 with Embiid and Maxey this season. I decided to take a look at the standings and game log to see how the Sixers performed with different lineups. I was just running these checks manually, so I probably made some minor errors (please be forgiving). The results reveal just how huge of an unknown this Sixers team is when healthy - but also how potentially dominant they can be.

**With Joel Embiid:** 30-8, 10-7 vs. &gt;.500 teams

**With Tyrese Maxey:** 41-27, 14-22 vs. &gt;.500 teams

**With Embiid &amp; Maxey:** 28-7, 9-6 vs. &gt;.500 teams

**With Embiid and four of our seven best role players\*:** 27-8, 10-5 vs. &gt;.500 teams

**With Maxey OR Embiid and five of our seven best role players\*:** 18-14, 6-9 vs. &gt;.500 teams

Craziest of all: **The sixers have played just 26 games with Embiid, Maxey, and 5/7 top role players and they are 22-4.** 9-3 against &gt;.500 teams. **Holy sh\*t.** Those losses are MIL on opening night, OT loss to Cleveland on 11/22, and destruction by NY on 1/6.

\*Harris, Melton, Batum, Oubre, Lowry/Pat Bev, Hield, and Bball Paul

The record against &gt;.500 teams with Embiid &amp; a mostly healthy (4/7 role players) team is dominant, but mostly games from loooong ago: The recent Ws over OKC &amp; Miami, January Ws over ORL, DEN, and autumn wins over MIN, OKC, LAL, IND, BOS, and PHX. 

Joel Embiid's other losses besides the aforementioned 3 to good teams were when the rest of the 76ers were  injured: no Maxey or Melton on 1/31, no Melton or Harris on 1/26. No Oubre or Batum on B2B vs Indiana/Boston on 11/15-11/16, with Boston being a schedule loss of 3 games in 4 nights.

Most of our tough games coinciding with heavily injured teams = a LOT of uncertainty.

There's very little sample size.

But the team has undoubtedly been dominant when healthy. We can take away that much.",sixers,78,https://www.reddit.com/r/sixers/comments/1c0njbc/the_sixers_308_record_with_embiid_the_absurdity/

I think Oubre has already proven what hes capable of so I wont consider him in this one. Its between Yabu and Caleb for me. 

If Yabu can play even 80% as well as he did in the olympics, that would be huge for us. Thatll also solve the size problem we have at the PF position + rebounding is always a great addition. 

If Caleb can hit the open shots hell get due to JoJo getting doubled, thatll also be huge and help complete our offense. 

Which of our role players do you think have the highest chance of playing above their means?

The fact that Harris owns two of Phillys biggest rivals already drives me crazy. He caved to pressure from Adam Silver to fire Hinke and hire Colangelo. His focus is on profit first, and the Sixers fan base and winning second. 

Brace yourself for the stadium fight coming up. If you dont think what is happening with the Chiefs and Royals could also happen here, think again, especially if his plan to build the area in Chinatown fails.

Sometimes you feel things like this and think alright maybe Im just being dramatic about this. No. It is confirmed. Him playing for Team USA and the entire country outside of Philly fans still praying on his downfall proves it. 

Joel Embiid is one of the most hated athletes of all time. In my lifetime of watching sports, the only people I can remember getting this kind of hate are Miami LeBron and Warriors KD. Maybe Tom Brady at times. And I cant even honestly say the hate for them was anywhere near as insane as the hate Joel has gotten.

Joel has clearly become more somber, serious, and perhaps even sad throughout the years. We all know Joel is a chronically online person, he loves the trends and hot topics. I can imagine this having an affect on him.

I hope he sees all of our support. We know Joel better than any of these crazed haters. We know what he really is. 

Keep supporting. Keep showing your love for Joel. Keep fighting the good fight. Hopefully, Joel sees it.

The Sixers still would have an $8 million and $6 million slot available for free agents. Theyll also have a way to generate another $5 million to $10 million slot. That will allow the team to get three guys making in that range of salary to go along with three max players  including Embiid ($51.4 million) and Maxey ($35.2 million).

Batum, who the Sixers acquired via a trade from the Los Angeles Clippers on Nov. 1, made $11.7 million last season. The team holds his Bird rights and has a cap hold of $17.5 million on the 35-year-old. The 6-foot-8, 230-pound forward didnt expect to like Philadelphia, but ended up loving it here. And Embiid made it known to Batum what he expects him to do.
Youre coming back to the Sixers, he told his good friend while interrupting his media scrum following the season-ending Game 6 first-round loss to the New York Knicks on May 6.

But the Sixers realize Oubre played himself out of a minimum-salary contract. ESPN noted hes a prime candidate to receive a room mid-level exception for $8 million.

2023-12-11,1702296371,Embiid talking about Simmons on Maxey's podcast,"[Link](https://open.spotify.com/episode/60IZMM4TEZB9qL4L9970h0) \- starts around 45:00

Maxey asks Embiid whether Simmons or Harden was harder to play with. Embiid says neither was hard to play with, but was way more complimentary about Simmons than I was expecting.

Rough summary of what he says:

\-Simmons never needed a jump shot, just needed to get his FT% to 75 so he'd have the confidence to keep attacking the paint. Says Simmons was a monster, was almost as fast as Maxey while being 6'10.

\-Him and Simmons were an instant top 5 defense, it didn't matter who else was on the floor.

\-Leaks to the media were handled badly. Embiid would read something leaked by Simmons' camp and would get frustrated and retaliate. Says if he was trying to force a trade and his camp was leaking things to the media, he'd let his teammates know it wasn't personal.

\-Thinks if Maxey had been able to play with Simmons and Embiid it would've been game-changing and was a perfect match: combining Maxey and Embiid's scoring with Simmons' defense, playmaking and transition play. Says 'that was the team' (Embiid + Maxey + Simmons), and he thinks about that pairing a lot. Says that there have been a lot of mistakes (like letting Mikal Bridges go), but 'that's the one that got away'.",sixers,103,https://www.reddit.com/r/sixers/comments/18ft2ju/embiid_talking_about_simmons_on_maxeys_podcast/

2023-10-31,1698746275,Harden trade: FAQ,"Whenever there's a big name player in a trade, a lot of fans who don't necessarily follow the team very closely seem to come here and express strong opinions on the trade. A lot of people seem to think the Sixers got fleeced, and whether that's true or not, the return should not be surprising. Here's some helpful context:

Q:  Why is the Harden return so bad? I expected much better. 

A: This deal is very similar in value to what the Sixers were reportedly seeking. According to [Stein](https://www.si.com/nba/clippers/news/report-clippers-considering-breaking-up-paul-george-and-kawhi-leonard), the Sixers sought expiring contracts, an unprotected first round pick, a first round pick swap and Terance Mann. The Sixers seem to have gotten almost that exact deal, except instead of Terance Mann they received an additional first round pick from a 3rd team. Whether Mann or a first round pick is more valuable is subjective, but they're at least roughly in the same ball park of value. 

&amp;#x200B;

Q: But it's JAMES HARDEN, shouldn't we have gotten more?

A: A player's trade value isn't always dependent entirely on how good they are. In Harden's case, there were several factors that may have lowered his value:

* Harden is an expiring contract. That means the team is only guaranteed to have him this year. There is generally a ceiling on how much of a return you can expect from players on expiring contracts. The Sixers once got Jimmy Butler for Saric, Covington and one second round pick. 
* Harden wants a big contract. The rift between the Sixers FO and Harden was because the Sixers didn't want to give him that. Any team that's trading for him now knows they'll have to offer him a big contract to keep him around after this year. 
* Harden has been discontent on three consecutive teams. Teams may be worried he'll be discontent on their team too. 
* Harden was intent on going to the Clippers. This means other teams will be hesitant to trade for a player that may not want to be there. Having a lack of other bidders also gives the Sixers less leverage. 

&amp;#x200B;

Q: Why didn't we get any good players? Why were we seeking expiring contracts?

A: There are two major benefits to expiring contracts. The main benefit is that they come off the books in time for free agency, which gives the team the ability to sign new players into cap space. The Sixers are on track to have a a lot of cap space going into next years free agency class. Tobias Harris' contract, which has been a long-standing liability, expires next year. Additionally, Tyrese Maxey will have a cap hold of around 13 million before he signs an extension. This means that before Maxey signs his extension, the Sixers can sign other players into cap space while 'pretending' Maxey is only going to be paid 13m next season. Maxey is actually going to be paid at minimum 35m next year. The Sixers are in a pretty unique position for a contending team of having a lot of cap space. 

The second benefit is that expiring contracts are easy to trade. Teams won't think twice about accepting expiring contracts because they don't have to worry about them after this year. Long-term contracts may be less desirable unless the players are valuable or on bargain contracts. This means expiring contracts can be easily combined with draft picks. If a player the Sixers want to trade for becomes available, they can easily make an offer with expiring contracts + picks. 

&amp;#x200B;

Q: If the players we received aren't good, doesn't that mean we lost the trade?

A: The vast majority of the value we received is with the draft capital, not the players. The 2028 Clippers unprotected pick specifically could be valuable because the Clippers core is old, and their draft capital is tied up so they have limited ability to improve the team or trade for more players. If the team blows up for whatever reason, the pick could be a good one. Previously, the Sixers had very little tradable draft capital, now they are one of the limited number of contenders with 3 first round picks to trade. 

&amp;#x200B;

Q: Why didn't we at least get Norman Powell? He scores a lot and seems really good. 

A: Norman Powell is on a long-term deal for 2 more years after this season. Essentially, the Sixers seem to value clearing the books next year over whatever value Powell provides. According to [Jake Fischer](https://sports.yahoo.com/2023-nba-free-agency-with-john-collins-trade-forwards-dominating-early-discussions-151510087.html), Norman Powell was considered available by the Clippers earlier this year but didn't end up traded. It's hard for non-insiders to speculate, but it's possible Powell's contract is viewed negatively and may be difficult to move on from. The Sixers may not want to take that chance, or may just not value Powell as a player.  

&amp;#x200B;

Q: How is this team supposed to contend with draft picks and expiring contracts? Aren't we wasting a year of Embiid?

A: The Sixers are not going to wait until 2028 and use the Clippers pick. They are going to trade it, and the rest of the draft capital. This is basically just an in-between move. What the Sixers do next is important. They may trade for a player, they may try to contend with what they have this year and target free agency. Right now the Sixers have flexibility, and it's really only once the next move happens that this move can be properly evaluated.",sixers,53,https://www.reddit.com/r/sixers/comments/17khewz/harden_trade_faq/

2024-05-01,1714584356,Josh Harris left his courtside seat with 30 seconds to go thinking it was over. LOL.,"During lunch, I wanted to re-watch that epic fourth quarter when I noticed something. I'm usually not looking for the Harris's but I noticed a small woman super pumped at the end of the game sitting courtside and I recognized her as Harris's wife. But Josh Harris wasn't sitting next to her. That was curious to me, so I re-winded the game and found that he was sitting beside her for all of the game until... 

Yeah. Dude, literally walked out on the team thinking it was over with 30 seconds left. Unless, he's in fact Batman, and got the Bat Signal; I dont know what else could get him to leave the game with his team facing elimination. 

Imagine missing out on that legendary comeback and being stuck in your limo trying to get back into MSG when the sixers are going one of the most improbable comebacks in playoff history. I guess money can't buy you everything because that moment is gone...
