2023-12-27,1703690811,"Let's not forget: Troy hired one of his oldest friends, Rob Murphy, who then allegedly sexually assaulted a subordinate.","In case anyone needs a refresher, here is another reminder of Troy's hiring of his friend of **20 YEARS**, Rob Murphy:

&gt;Murphy has longstanding ties to Weaver, whom he considers both a friend and mentor. Their relationship dates back 20 years, Murphy said, and precedes when he replaced Weaver, who left for a soucting job with the Utah Jazz, as an assistant coach at Syracuse in 2004. 

[https://nypost.com/2023/05/04/pistons-fire-rob-murphy-amid-sexual-harassment-allegations/](https://nypost.com/2023/05/04/pistons-fire-rob-murphy-amid-sexual-harassment-allegations/)

&gt;Raska told the Detroit Free Press that Murphy, who she trusted as a mentor, used his job to make her his sexual target  alleging he groped her private parts in front of her 4-year-old daughter.  
&gt;  
&gt;Raska alleged that Murphy sexually harassed her for months behind closed doors while she worked as his executive assistant, claiming he grabbed her buttocks multiple times, subjected her to unwanted kissing, often told her she aroused him and said he wanted to put a baby in her.  
&gt;  
&gt;Raska also alleged Murphy tried to force her to have sex, but she managed to push him off of her as he held her down on a bed.

It isn't just Gores who can't make proper decisions, but Troy and Arm as well. We've got Eric Tellem (Senior Director of Player Personnel, Son of Arm Tellem) and Rob Murphy as examples of the incompetence of our franchise's key decision-makers to put the proper people in place in the org.

This is not to make light of the victim in this situation - but to show that on multiple levels, these people are not suitable to run an NBA franchise.",DetroitPistons,31,https://www.reddit.com/r/DetroitPistons/comments/18s372p/lets_not_forget_troy_hired_one_of_his_oldest/

2024-07-07,1720380868,"The ATHLETIC's JEIII shits on Weaver in his latest, or why I have little respect for many media members.","[https://www.nytimes.com/athletic/5620165/2024/07/06/trajan-langdon-pistons-cade-cunningham/](https://www.nytimes.com/athletic/5620165/2024/07/06/trajan-langdon-pistons-cade-cunningham/)

Edwards posted a new article that praises Langdon as a modern thinker who ""did not spend all his cap space the first days of free agency like management has done in the past.  He did not sign players to long contracts or overpay for said players like management has in the past.""

JEIII has long been considered an arrogant apologist for former DETROIT GM Troy Weaver, often pushing back on fan criticism with basic retorts that Weaver is playing 4-D chess while the fans only understand checkers. Yet  in today's article, he must have said ""past management"" 30 times in listing flawed ideas and tragic missteps that one can not help but hear Weaver in many of his examples.

And this is why I have very little respect for him as a journalist, I understand to be a beat writer you have to be professional and not bite the had that feeds you. But most players understand that to be a professional, you have to be honest with your readers. It was rarely that Weaver was ever criticized by Edwards. JEIII was the one that fed many fans that the PISTONS were one player or one season away from the play-offs, just give Weaver more time, more money, etc., despite repeated bottom of the league won-loss records.

A year or two ago, he started mentioning on twitter and in his articles, that the PISTON situation was not fair to Weaver because he was not given an all-star like James Harden or Kevin Durant that he could turn into multiple #1's. Of course if DETROIT had such players, they probably would not have an opening for Weaver in the first place. Which is rich because one of Weaver's first quotes went something like ""Every NBA draft contains good NBA players that are not always found at the top of the draft, it is my job to identify and get those players""

In fact, it was JEIII during the losing streak that started to openly question Williams (when he had previously rarely, if ever, questioned PISTON management, Weaver, or previous coach Casey) and blaming him for the losing streak. As if to say, ""like I have been telling you all, the roster is good, we are almost a play-off team and look what this guy is doing to it.""

So today, he posts this article. And it triggered me. How many times have we heard from beat writers that all is good when fans are questioning the teams management in direction (in all sports!) only for once there is a new management team in place or player is moved off of team, they mention all the warts fans were speculating about before. And the kicker is that they will phrase it such a way that these warts or mistakes are acceptable facts now, ""Everyone knew...."". No, everyone did not know.  You, Mr. writer, are our portal into the team and you call malarkey on those very facts you now say are obvious. How are we supposed to read you when anything you say today may be changed tomorrow.  You have an opinion, fine, then say in your article that your opinion is.... or ""others around the league may question this move because...."" But if I can not watch the game myself, than I rely on you, Mr. Writer.  I can not talk to the players or coach after game, so I rely on you to ask the questions that I want to know. Even if you are going to be a cheerleader for my team, that is ok, just be consistent.  The idea that Weaver could do no wrong, but everyone else in DETROIT's management team is shaky is untrue, and really a manipulative lie. When you have been historically bad as the PISTONS have been the last 4 years, no on gets to come off as above blame.

Shame on you, JEIII, for conveying anything different.",DetroitPistons,64,https://www.reddit.com/r/DetroitPistons/comments/1dxos0d/the_athletics_jeiii_shits_on_weaver_in_his_latest/

2023-11-13,1699903241,About Cade Cunningham.,"After his disaster class yesterday, I've seen a lot of reactionary comments that he's not the guy or will never be the guy. But all I'm trying to say is that this is basically his SECOND year. How was Ant in his second year? How is Paolo? And who were their teammates and how much spacing did they get compared to Cade now?

Image Cade on the Magic right now instead of Paolo who has Franz, Suggs, Fultz on the side. Look at Paolo's first 4 games this year and how much spacing he gets yet he still had those stats. Now imagine if Cade had Kat or Gobert and actual vets who can score like Ant has. Ant is currently making his massive leap in his FOURTH year. He doesn't have teammates like Hayes, Stew, etc.

Looking at Cade's games this years, I would honestly say that he's doing FINE for being his second year only with the team he has. He's exhausted forced to play 38-40 minutes a night. We're overreacting because we've been losing for years and since Cade has been out for a year we FORGOT that this is his second year. Also, having 3+ crucial teammates out for several of his games doesn't help either.",DetroitPistons,147,https://www.reddit.com/r/DetroitPistons/comments/17uiekm/about_cade_cunningham/

Idk about you guys, but I am unbelievably excited to watch Cade next year, moreso than watching the new rookie, the development of Ivey/Duren/Stew/AT/Sasser (if they're all here), etc. 

Nearly the entire league isn't aware of how special Cade is yet because of injury and the horrible roster and rotation mismanagement over the past few years. Even if Trajan is in asset collection mode, the team will inevitably have more playable talent with a hungry new head coach who will want to win. All this to say, I am bullish on the idea of Cade breaking out this upcoming year, both as a franchise cornerstone and as a NBA media favorite. Draft, free agency, trades, and summer league will all come and go, but year 4 is building up to be a great one.

2023-12-17,1702819717,Piston Help,"I am reaching out in a bit of a bind and could use some help. My 2003 Silverado has hit a snag, specifically with the piston, and Im struggling to pinpoint the exact issue.

Here are the symptoms:

	1.	Sputtering Engine: The engine has started sputtering intermittently, especially during acceleration. It feels like theres a loss of power.
	2.	Strange Noises: There are unusual clanking noises emanating from the engine compartment, particularly when the vehicle is idling.
	3.	Decreased Performance: Ive noticed a significant decrease in overall performance, with a noticeable drop in fuel efficiency.

Ive checked the basics like oil levels and spark plugs, but I suspect a more intricate problem lies with the piston. If you could spare some time to offer any guidance, I would greatly appreciate it. Any mechanical expertise could be the key to getting my Silverado back on the road.

Feel free to give me a call at [Your Phone Number] or reply to this message when you have a moment. Im grateful for any assistance you can provide.

Side note: do not go to Weaver Garage to get your car fixed. He took my newer parts off in a previous repair and replaced them with other parts that cant fire and nobody wanted in their vehicles

2023-12-25,1703542118,Posting a random Pistons role player until the losing streak ends: Lindsey Hunter,"Born on December 3, 1970, in Jackson, Mississippi, Hunter had a successful college basketball career at Jackson State University before entering the NBA.

Hunter was selected by the Detroit Pistons in the first round of the 1993 NBA Draft as the 10th overall pick. He quickly established himself as a solid defensive player and a reliable scorer. Known for his quickness, agility, and tenacious defense, Hunter became an integral part of the Pistons' roster.

During his first stint with the Pistons, Hunter played alongside notable players like Grant Hill. He contributed to the team's success, including their appearance in the 1996 Eastern Conference Finals. His defensive skills were particularly crucial, earning him a spot on the NBA All-Defensive Second Team for the 1999-2000 season.

Hunter was traded to the Milwaukee Bucks for Billy Owens in 2000. Throughout his career, Hunter also played for other NBA teams, showcasing his versatility and adaptability. He had stints with the Milwaukee Bucks, Los Angeles Lakers, Toronto Raptors, and Chicago Bulls, among others. Despite bouncing between teams, Hunter maintained his reputation as a reliable role player.

One of the highlights of Hunter's career came during the 2001-2002 season when he won an NBA championship as a member of the Los Angeles Lakers. Serving as a backup point guard, Hunter played a key role in the Lakers' success, providing valuable minutes off the bench.

Following that season, Hunter was dealt again (on draft night 2002), this time to the Toronto Raptors, along with the rights to Chris Jefferies, for Tracy Murray and Kareem Rush. In August 2003, the Pistons re-acquired Hunter by sending Michael Curry to the Raptors. He was traded to the Boston Celtics in February 2004 along with Chucky Atkins and Detroit's 2004 first-round draft pick for Mike James, in order to make the salary cap figures work out for the trade that brought Rasheed Wallace to the Pistons. Hunter never played a game for the Celtics; he was immediately released and re-signed by Detroit a week later. Hunter and the Pistons went on to win the 200304 NBA championship. Hunter and the Pistons went back to the Finals in 20042005, but Detroit lost the series in seven games to the San Antonio Spurs. During the Pistons Finals runs, Hunter was credited as a tenacious on-ball defender off the bench. He was credited with guarding Jason Kidd, Kobe Bryant, and Tony Parker in Detroit's two Finals runs.

On March 7, 2007, Hunter was suspended for ten games after testing positive for phentermine. He claimed he was using his wife's diet pills, which made him test positive for the banned substance.

Hunter signed a one-year nonguaranteed contract with the Chicago Bulls on November 13, 2008. On July 13, 2009, Hunter re-signed with the Bulls for the veteran minimum of $1.3 million. At age 39, Hunter was the oldest player active during the 20092010 NBA seasonuntil the Bulls waived him on March 3, 2010 (to make room for Chris Richard).

After retiring as a player, Lindsey Hunter transitioned into coaching. He served as an assistant coach for various NBA teams, including the Phoenix Suns and the Golden State Warriors.",DetroitPistons,16,https://www.reddit.com/r/DetroitPistons/comments/18qsbla/posting_a_random_pistons_role_player_until_the/

2023-12-07,1701950199,This is definitely the worst its been,"Im 35, remember the Jerome Williams/Mikki Moore days, the Stuckey, Josh Smith days, etc. I thought those years hovering around the 8 seed were bad but this is much worse. Theres years where youre bad with a purpose, like the first year of the rebuild where we fought hard and played a roster that (on paper) made sense but just wasnt good enough- and theres this.


Even the bright spots are starting to look faint.


Sasser looks like shit, sure hes young but hes not that young. Dude was a 4 year college player, you take guys like that to play right away- especially ones who are undersized shooters (who right now cant shoot)


Cade looking more like an off ball scorer, than a PG. Problem is hes slow, unathletic and that doesnt age great especially when you cant overpower guys with strength and arent a dead eye shooter.

Ivey is blackballed, its impossible to even critique. I thought this year was going to be worth watching just to see him and Cade and judge if theyre the backcourt of the future or not and 25% into the season we have no idea. And then this dumb mother fucker (Monty) gives quotes like, I have to find wants to get Ivey more time. Its simple start him, tie him and Cades fucking ankles together. When Cade goes in, he goes in. 

Livers we have heard is this 3andD connector, JE3 pouring out the cool air as usual for the team. He could start I kept hearing if he was healthy, dude literally looks like he should be in the G League. Hes going on 26!!! Hes not an nba player.


Stew I went from really liking as a rookie to not being able to stand him which is sad because its not his fault for being pegged into this role but the teams obsession with him at the 4 is ridiculous. If I remember Casey quotes years ago about it, sounded weird then too like it was a narrative coming from the top. The guys a backup big, period. Move him for something, were in no position to be prioritizing backups with where we are at right now.

Jalen Duren had me hype a few games in. He was playing so well that it was him Cade and I didnt care because I knew even an idiot GM would eventually figure out all I need is shooters around these two but hes obviously Lamelo Ball and his ankles are made of paper mache and this will be a problem his entire career, so we are fucked.

We are a Cade injury away from Ballys taking these games off in favor of billiard tournaments.

Those calling for a trade, no. One move, two moves wont help this team. This is systematic, problem too down. Cant let the same shitheads who got us here double down and make built in excuses for the next FO. Thats how we get years of excuses like Weaver got when it was obvious he sucked from the first move he made now as we look back. You fire the whole FO, have some adult in the room be the acting game and just sit on their hands and look all over now- end of season for a new GM to overpay and pray this one is the right one.",DetroitPistons,89,https://www.reddit.com/r/DetroitPistons/comments/18cu19y/this_is_definitely_the_worst_its_been/

2024-10-09,1728474663,Preseason Game #2 vs PHX (at Michigan State) STATS &amp; Xs &amp; Os,"I was at this game last night.  It was really cool that they collaborated to do this.  Ishbia and Gores both being MSU Alum and all.  Anyway, here is my analysis of the game last night.

[DET FG&amp;#37; GAME](https://preview.redd.it/x8i6617zrptd1.png?width=274&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=72497ce0b546c03e0c58109d13268522c6c68615)

Overall the Pistons shot what we should probably call ""good"".  41%.  It did not feel good tho.  As you can see from the shot chart above, the continued trend of 3's or layups is a very good thing.  This is showing a willingness to get to the hoop and finish.

  
Since this is a preseason game, I thought I'd break this down into 1st and 2nd Quarters since most of us probably care more about how the starters played than how the bottom of the bench played.

[DET FG&amp;#37; Q1](https://preview.redd.it/j9aho64fsptd1.png?width=275&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=035077106e60df4f2d0a7c2702e9d9deaeb1ec9f)

In the first Quarter the Pistons shot 11/19, which is excellent.  They attacked the hoop and went 3/7 from 3.  Offensively, this is what I had hoped for.  As a team, for the entire game, the Pistons shot 17/20 from the FT Line (85%).  That is a great marker to point to for future team success.  Teams that tend to attack the hoop get to the charity stripe, and teams that get to the charity stripe and shoot 85% tend to win!

[DET FG&amp;#37; Q2](https://preview.redd.it/xu27iom9tptd1.png?width=278&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7f9daaa5d73725c85c359a87ee1247228f3fc85e)

I wouldn't say the wheels feel off, but the Pistons certainly regressed in the 2nd Quarter.  Going 1/9 from 3 kills a lot of good momentum.  Fonteccio and Cade both went 0-2 from 3.  It's tough, but they were still in this game until then.

I won't speak to much to the 2nd half, as I've already stated.  

[PHX FG&amp;#37; GAME](https://preview.redd.it/wx5et2grtptd1.png?width=275&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=599d00acd36de4f856db505b8ee73329d5399fc6)

Here is PHX FG% for the entire game.  All those little green circles were KD/Book and it's what killed us.  It was so frustrating to watch a great defensive possession be forgotten by KD/Book being KD/Book.

I have no clue why PHX missed so many corner 3s from the right side.  Weird.  If it happens in future games that could be a scheme/personal reason, but nothing to cite yet.

[PHX FG&amp;#37; Q1](https://preview.redd.it/rxf5nkd5uptd1.png?width=277&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4f2375b80be9dfccf2da6df932767281b78d755f)

  
Here is PHX FG% from Q1.  They came out hot as well.  You can look at this a few different ways.  You can bemoan that they let 5(?) layups happen in the first quarter.  You could bemoan the high % of 3s they made.  But I believe that DET's interior defense was strong enough at the start that PHX passed out to the wings and made their 3s.  And once they made their 3s you had to respect it, which opened up the paint.  

As I was sitting there I was thinking how you have to let them have something.  You cannot take every possible move away from them.  The eye test showed great defense and forced a lot of ball movement.  PHX just made their shots.

[PHX FG&amp;#37; Q2](https://preview.redd.it/d8iga5ntuptd1.png?width=277&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d7c85f251440593a228662b011c813bc3db5a411)

Here is the 2nd quarter, where the shooting came back down to earth.  30% instead of 58%.

  
Below are some handy visuals to help illustrate what happened.

[Lead Tracker](https://preview.redd.it/axm22qnzuptd1.png?width=1024&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=809c8c3599cbb5952c6f6221830aed9889170434)

This lead tracker shows that the starters kept it close, but once they were taken out the Suns bench blew out our bench.  So I'm being optimistic here.



[Leading Players](https://preview.redd.it/kfh4zqnzuptd1.png?width=501&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=32c92064980ea0698c8b2d33c8a8558a5a5cf610)

Duren would probably be considered the ""Player of the Game"" if I ever enjoyed being reductionistic.  He played what we will hopefully be calling ""average"" this year.  17 points, 6 rebounds, went 6/9 from the floor (nice) and played pretty good eye-test defense.

Cade passed the ball around a lot.  But did not seem as impactful as I'd been hoping he would be.  I am not concerned.  


[Team Comparison](https://preview.redd.it/5zlp5snzuptd1.png?width=496&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=134ad1339ff901a859c414a8cc42a45e9d077d40)

Super easy graphic here.  Just like against the Bucks, we won the Pts in the Paint, and the FT disparity.  18 TOs kills any shot any team has of winning.

  
Below are a variety of stats all from [NBA.com](http://NBA.com) (Everything I've shared is from [NBA.com](http://NBA.com) )

[Detroit Traditional Box Score](https://preview.redd.it/lmpmwvh2wptd1.png?width=1027&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a9dd68cb882bb073a3b80f053ee67c148471b38c)

We shot 30.3 % from 3.  That number going up is a must for our chances to improve.  Especially early in the game.  It's a different game if we shoot 40% from 3 in the first half (of a normal non-preseason game).

FTs looks great.  41.2 is low for FG%.  I have not compared it to League Average, but 29 assists seems either low or about right.  



[Detroit Advanced Stats](https://preview.redd.it/j4hvmst9wptd1.png?width=1026&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ce8c6a8d21394f9928ee163a47a73b98fee8ed32)

The Big question from this game that I have is ""Will Ron Holland make the Rotation?""  I lean towards no.  And the eye test strengthened that for me.  He just doesn't look like he belongs on the same floor (at the moment).  And if JB goes with a 9 man rotation that most likely leaves out RHII.  I was not impressed by his play.  But we will see.

Also, the website that I use for clips/highlights, doesn't do preseason games so I cannot show you what I want to (I will during the Regular Season), but there was a moment when Holland was inbounding the ball from the corner and I could just feel a TO coming on.  And he did.  It's hard to describe what his play is like, but I have not been impressed.  Maybe that will change because I hope he becomes a great player. He seems like he's more raw than usual 5th picks.  But I digress.

Not much else to say without getting into the weeds of things that won't matter in a few weeks.  Duren was good.  Ivey was good.  Cade was meh.  A good NBA game became a glorified summer league game at MSU last night.  I think if the starters could have stayed in they would have been more competitive.

2024-03-06,1709765598,How about we DONT spend 50 million on Tobias Harris? ,"And maybe just sign guys similar to Fontechio that can shoot and provide decent defense at the guard and wing position? Like why not take the 60 million and cut a check to guys like Grayson Allen, Gary Harris, Royce ONeal, Taurean Prince, Kelly Oubre, and split that 50 or so million it would take to add somebody like Tobias Harris into guys we believe could help Cade, Ivey, Duren, and Ausar? Because if we pay Tobias Harris 50 million&first he has to take the money. And its not like hes walking away from Philly for cheap. 

If we believe Cade to be a legit 3 level scorer who can play make with others and needs shooting, what does adding just basically Tobias Harris and another rookie really do? If we want Duren to be a better defender its clearly going to take time, why not add better wing and guard defense to make things easier on him, Cade, Ivey, and the team? How does Ausar and Stew fit into this? I think Ausar also could benefit from more actualized reliable shooters and experienced defenders. Stew I think we all see should be the backup five anyway. Idk.

 I was listening to another fan who suggested these guys. It made some sense to me.

2023-11-15,1700059957,This is one of the youngest starting lineup in the league (23.3) with Ivey as a sixth man(22). NO ONE deserves to be on a hot seat,"The rush to be good is insane after just getting over a roster that had us is cap hell for years just to be an 8th seed. We know how terrible it can be being that team that makes the playoffs only to lose first round every single time (this is why the trailblazers are in the exact same scenario as us) 

We have the building blocks in place. Literally every year 2-3 player has shown improvement and its DRAMATIC(Stews shooting, Iveys control and pace, Durens all around game, etc&). Cade was damn near injured for all of last season and still comes in dropping 20+ points and 6+ assist. Killian has confidence to shoot now(even if it doesnt go in). 

This is how dynastys are made. Stop trying to rush things and wanting to trade for disgruntled stars to end up back in purgatory. Weve still never even seen this team actually play together considering 4 players who would get significant minutes are hurt. We are in a great position overall, yes we are losing games but based on the age of the players things are likely to only get better. 

No weaver doesnt need to be fired, this teams future is bright. No Monty doesnt need to be fired, I trust his coaching and I  can see players improvement overall. No Cade doesnt need to be given a lesser role, he has the tools needed to be a star he is fucking 22 for crying out loud give him a chance to put it together.

2024-01-30,1706614719,This Pistons team is 100% NOT better without Cade," Cade last 9 games pre-injury 29.1 ppg 8.3 apg (3.6 TOVs) 4.8 rpg  52.7/38.8/84.9 62 TS  O Rating 122.1 N Rating -2.3  1-8  Ivey without Cade (9 games) 19.8 ppg 5.7 apg (2.6 TOVs) 4.9 rpg  42.9/31.6/62.2 51.2 TS  O Rating 106.3  N Rating -15.7  3-6 

 You clearly see the record difference and why might that be?   Bench Production in the Cade stretch  31.4 ppg on 43.3 from the field 36.6 from 3  Net Rating: -20  Bench Production without him  48.9 ppg on 48.4 from the field 41.9 from 3  Net Rating: -.4 

You may ask , why is the bench so much better without Cade? The truth is that because of Cade's absence Killian Hayes starts and because of that Sasser gets more minutes. In the past 20 games killian hayes is posting averages of 3.6 PPG/ 5.3 APG/2.5 RPG in 20.4 MPG on 35/16/62 Splits 39.5 TS% 96.6 ORTG. I think it is evident that Hayes should be waived as he is a detriment to this roster.

Cade Cunningham is the future of this organisation and anyone who doubts it should take a deeper look.

2024-06-26,1719418584,"The more I think about it, the more ridiculous it seems the idea that Duren should be traded or relegated to backup.","Giving a $25 million per bag to Claxton just because he's a better rim protector (right now) over a potential All Star in Duren, is move that reeks of impatience and desperation. Jalen is 20 years old folks. He has the talent, and the willingness to be coached and blossom his game.

His numbers around the board made what really was a significant leap from his rookie to his sophmore season. Yes, he checked out last year, but guess who else did? The majority of the roster. He was also playing through injuries.

Just because his rim protecting dipped slightly doesn't mean he won't still develop that aspect of his game. Once this squad has established it's new culture and are not despairing before the tip off of every game with the expectation that they are going to lose, and, most importantly, Duren is fully healthy again, we'll likely see a massive change in how he carries himself on the defensive end.

Trade this man and he'll average 20/15 in a hurry. Bench him for Claxton and he'll be both pissed and developmentally stunted (even if only for a year and Claxton is traded). Start him at the 5 and bring Stewart off of the bench behind him. Save the cap space to sign a stretch forward or two. Duren hasn't even averaged 30 minutes per in the NBA yet.

One other important thing to note here is how much better of a FT shooter Duren is to Claxton, which heightens his value significantly late in games.

&gt; Whomever the Pistons tab for the position wont have the benefit of a top-three pick at their disposal, as the organization fell to No. 5 for the third straight year during Sundays NBA Lottery, but even so, Detroit has been speaking to some promising candidates to fill the role, which has been vacant since 2018.

&gt; Part of the hold up, league sources say, is that Detroit appears interested in making a run at Minnesota Timberwolves head executive Tim Connelly, whose team is currently in the midst of a second-round playoff matchup with Connellys former team, the defending-champion Denver Nuggets.

&gt; Whether or not Connelly returns to the Timberwolves, league sources say he is likely to opt out of the final year of his contract. It seems likely that Connelly will return to Minnesota, but if Pistons owner Tom Gores is willing to offer something like $15 million annually, that could be enough to pry him away.

&gt; New Orleans Trajan Langdon, Dallas Dennis Lindsey and Chicagos Marc Eversley, among others, have established themselves as viable targets for the role, league sources tell The Athletic.",DetroitPistons,57,https://www.reddit.com/r/DetroitPistons/comments/1cr2jq9/charania_detroit_is_interested_in_making_a_run_at/

-Explaining how OKC prioritized skill, processing, and high level positional length + high character guys.

-Compares us more like the Nets who have zero overarching vision/roster direction. Just a collection of talent.

-Explaining how when the rockets signed Ime Udoka, they immediately got players that fit Udoka direction for the team (defense) where as Troy added Joe Harris and Monte Morris and just said We want to play defense instead of actually building a team that way.

-Explaining how Rockets nailed their picks all across the board like Tari Eason, Cam Whitmore, and the rest of their young core

2024-02-15,1708002544,Takeaways from seeing the Detroit/Phoenix game from the front row,"Living in Phoenix I only get to see the pistons once I year so I always go for the best tickets I can find. This year, I got to be courtside(one row back from actually having to put sneakers on court) and here are some takeaways Ive noticed 

1. Cade gets highly discouraged if he isnt getting calls. You can hear his tone go from a LETS GO to fuck this game towards the end of the first. I think it also plays apart in his turnovers, where he was angry at himself for the first one but once he got discouraged he didnt seem to care at all after he threw one (we were down by 20 early so that also can affect him mentally).

2. Play calling is non existent. Our players didnt talk, there were zero off ball screens, no hand movements that called out plays just pick and roll and hope for a mismatch? Half of the time even when the pick didnt stop anyone they(our entire team)  just drove to the lane in traffic and put up a bad shot! I said this before it doesnt matter how many shooters we have if no one is willing to pass to them. Our players are young so I get bad decision making so MAYBE they can get a pass on this

3. Jaden Ivey and Duren HAVE to step up and also be vocal leaders. They had their head hung as soon as soon as we got down by 10. No sir, you guys are the future and have to be loud. Yell at guys to get back, tell someone if they took a bad shot, etc& We need the core to give us an identity and start making it known this is their team. 

4. Ausar is amazing. Dude was someone who seemed to always give it his all regardless of the situation. To go from defending KD to getting back on offense and still skying for put backs and offensive boards is incredible. I dont give a damn that he doesnt have a shot I want him to be here for a long time. 

In the end; I really think a lot of issues can be fixed by coaching. I get our guys our young and also losing a lot so its easy to end up hating the game (one of the reasons Im against purposefully tanking). Someone has to talk to them and let them know though it wont get better and they cant improve by playing half-assed.

2023-12-31,1704003838,From JEIII's latest article about Cade's mentality during the losing streak:,"&gt;**Cunningham will be the first to tell you he played his part in allowing things to spiral to this degree in Detroit.**  
&gt;  
&gt;...  
&gt;  
&gt;**Cunningham wanted to be the No. 1 pick because of the responsibilities  that come with that, the anxiety.** He easily could have tanked the  pre-NBA Draft process and landed in Houston, not far from his hometown  of Arlington, Texas. **He wanted to take the blame for why an organization  struggled.** In turn, he wanted to be the face for when it arrived.Cunningham  said he had to do some soul-searching during the losing streak. He had  to come to grips with the fact his play contributed to the skid. He had  to learn how to lead at such a young age amid a situation few people in  this world will ever find themselves in. He needed to navigate how to  provide realism and optimism when it looks like there is no light at  the end of the tunnel.  
&gt;  
&gt;This wasnt just a losing skid of epic proportions. This was a crash course in life.  
&gt;  
&gt;It  wasnt that I questioned myself if I was the guy (to help turn a  franchise around) because my faith has been strong and has gotten  stronger with this, Cunningham said. **I know God put me in this  position for a reason.**  
&gt;  
&gt;**However, I knew I wasnt doing enough. My  game wasnt at the level it needed to be to help turn this franchise  around. As much as it sucked, this streak, I feel like I learned a ton  about myself, which is something I want to live with forever. I did a  lot of reflecting every night.**

This dude is as genuine as it gets, and as mature as a 22 year-old athlete can possibly be. No way he turns down a deserved max extension or even wants to be anywhere else. He wants to bring this team back to glory.

2024-02-28,1709131235,I'm really liking what I'm seeing from this new look Pistons squad,"Let's start with the obvious - no, this roster, as it stands, isn't a championship-level team, and is stuck with a terrible coach that I'm not going to discuss here. However, the recent trades and moves have left me more optimistic than I've been about the talent on this team in a while.

# The Core 4

Cade, for one, looks rejuvenated. You've seen the offensive numbers post-all star break, but he's been playing better defense, his effort level looks higher, and he's been more efficient on offense. He's dialed in on both ends, and finally looks like he's becoming the player we all hoped he would be - a star around which the rest of a high-level team can orbit.

Ivey is playing second-banana, but he can be a very, very good one. He's a high-character team player that right now seems to be trying to figure out a way to play in Cade's orbit. In February the kid is averaging 18/4/3 with 43/43/80 splits and a positive (1.8) +/-! He's going through a bit of an offensive slump these past few games, but like Cade he seems dialed in on defense so some of the inconsistency may be from him figuring out how to manage the energy needed to be effective on both ends (last night's 15/5 line on 4/7 shooting is a nice step forward).

Duren continues to be a double-double machine that oozes with unrealized potential, both offensive and defensive. We can see some steps forward of both - he's always good for at least one ""where the hell did that come from"" drive per game, and his defensive positioning and awareness has taken a step up, to where he's averaging 1.5 blocks per game over his last eight and 2.5 over his last few (it's his best three-game stretch of blocks since the first three games of the season).

Thompson, due to his monstrous upside, he may be the key to this group ascending. His combination of Bball IQ, athleticism, and work ethic is unbelievable, and it's not inconceivable that he could become an all-NBA player in the mold of someone like Scottie Pippen. It's a bit of dead-horse-beating to harp on an outside shot that is still very much a work in progress, but there are signs of improvement there, too;  he's actually shooting 29% from deep in February, which is still bad but far more respectable than the 14, 16, and 12 percents he was shooting in November, December, and January. And he really needs to do that, too, because since the start of the year, the team is +2.2 with him on the court (that number shocked me, not gonna lie) - an indication of how important his defensive presence is.

# Supporting Cast

Stewart is the quintessential glue guy that continues to be the most underrated player on the team, because he's a paradigm-buster that most fans (and one stupid coach) don't really know how to classify. He's a natural center in a power forward's body. He's a defensive stalwart whose contributions don't show up in the box score - he gets very few blocks and steals, but opposing players shoot 12% lower inside five feet when he's defending them, which is up there with guys like Rudy Gobert (14%). Offensively, he's a good distance shooter (37% on threes) but has no midrange or post game. But he leads the team in on/off +/-, demonstrating how important he is to this squad. He simply plays winning basketball, but doesn't get enough credit for it.

Grimes is still getting his legs under him, but has shown signs of being the tenacious defender they need at the wing, and offensively he's given hints that he could be a wing that can actually do more than just shoot threes. The jury is still a bit out on him so far, but the Pistons have him signed through next year, after which he's a restricted free agent. He's a guy that fits really well with their group, is still young, and feels like he's only scratched the surface of what he can do.

Sasser's limited use is one of the many baffling coaching decisions Monty has made this season - the kid is a little small, but offensively gifted, flirting with the ultra-rare 50/40/90 shooting line on offense. He's struggled a bit on defense, but like most of the team that's coming around, as well. He's an ideal backup PG, capable of facilitating for other players on offense and figuring out how to be that pesky defender that makes life miserable for opposing PGs. He has some fundamental things he still needs to improve on defense, but he's under team control for the next three years at a *very* reasonable rate.

# Priority Team Free Agents

Fontecchio looks like a hell of a pick-up. I'm not sure what he'll get in the offseason, but his outside shooting and solid defense have really nice additions to this team - he actually reminds me a bit of Bogey, but with better defense (opponents are shooting 7% below their averages against him since [he's joined Detroit](https://www.nba.com/stats/player/1631323/defense-dash?LastNGames=7)). He's a restricted free agent, which gives Detroit most of the negotiating leverage, and I think a long-term contract in the $12 - $15 million per year range would be a huge win for the team.

Fournier is an average-at-best NBA player that has a club option the team needs to waive. He's not worth $19 million, so getting rid of him is a huge priority this offseason.

# Summary

So that's where we stand at the moment. Compared to the beginning of the year, this circle of 8 is made up of players that are capable both offensively and defensively, and should be looked upon as the group of players that should form the center of the end stages of this rebuild. Aside from Fontecchio, the Pistons only have about $57 million committed to that group, in addition to some two-way players and about $40 million or so in non-guaranteed salaries that they can waive if they need to. That's a *really* good place to be.

2024-07-20,1721443602,Happy with the Ron Holland pick,"Watched every minute of summer league, I came away pretty impressed with Ron Holland.

For a guy who is the second youngest player in the entire Summer League I thought he did pretty well in his first NBA action. 

Plenty of ups and downs but I think the stuff that he wasn't good at is stuff that he can get better at with more experience and strength which will come with age and a pro weight program with a real dietitian.

He gets downhill so quickly like a running back hitting the hole and is able to cover so much ground with his strides that he's going to be a bitch to stop at the rim once he gains more strength.

He had so many little bunnies that if he was just a little stronger he could have gone up harder with and finished.

The shot was about what I expected his form looks nice and for the most part I think it's just a matter of getting shots in the gym with good coaching think and gaining more confidence but I think the base for being at least an average shooter is there already.

The defense was impressive when he didn't have to switch and fight through screens too much I think he got lost a few times but that's expected with a young guy who doesn't have much practice time the effort and intensity were very impressive though!

And last which is also the biggest reason why I think he will be successful,the guy just seems like a pro. He's a very intense competitor but he doesn't act like a clown and it seemed like he was listening to the coaches on the sideline anytime they were trying to give him advice,he didn't look like he was blowing them off he looked like he was listening intently.

I think he fits in perfectly with the guys we have already who also seem to have similar style attitudes which is why I'm not sure Buzelis would have worked here. He seems like kind of a loudmouth clown type and I remember seeing footage of one of his pre draft interviews and thinking I'm not sure I want this guy on the team.

On another note it seems like we absolutely nailed the Klintman pick.

2023-12-19,1702950208,Yall were right about the Wiseman/Bey trade,"When we first shipped out Saddiq (AND TWO PICKS) for Wiseman, I didnt love it but I was willing to give him a try. Im generally an optimist, or try to be.

Loved his tape coming into the draft. We all read the stories; All he needs is reps, GSW just didnt have minutes for him.

I wanted to believe. Who among us didnt?

Every month since, the curtain pulls back a bit further on the truth. There is no deep secret vault of untapped talent to Wiseman. The reason Saddiq asserted himself on our team was that he WAS one of our best players, and he keeps getting better.

Tonight against the Hawks, it just hits different.

Watching Wiseman (whos playing ONLY because of injuries to our 2 frontline guys) get burned on three god damned PNRs in a row, watching him getting slapped around by Okongwu and Capela, meanwhile Saddiq bullies his way to an easy scoop lay against our star 66 point guard, I have to say&

Theres no silver lining here. Less than 11 months later, theres no way this trade can be redeemed.

I was wrong. But I dont feel bad. What do I know? This isnt my job, Im just some guy.

2024-06-28,1719615304,"THJ, Cade, and what Langdon has said about bringing in contracts","TL;DR: THJ helped mentor Cade about his shin injury. Langdon has made it clear he's looking to bring in vets to mentor the young core both on and off the court

I haven't really paid attention to THJ outside of random rumors tying us to him over the years. I'm an MSU fan and wasn't watching much basketball when he was at UofM anyway, so all I know is he is known as a shooter, his dad was in NBA Jam, and his dad used to be an assistant coach for us.

I came across [this article](https://www.si.com/nba/mavericks/news/dallas-mavs-tim-hardaway-jr-mentors-detroit-pistons-cade-cunningham-season-ending-surgery) from January 2023 while poking around and thought this paragraph stood out: 

&gt; Although teams interest in Hardaway surely stems from his 3-point shooting ability, his ability to be a good locker room presence and mentor to young players might also be high on the list.

Elsewhere in the article they talk about Cade and his shin surgery. Apparently, THJ convinced Cade to go through with it and helped reassure him that it was the right move. I would tend to agree that it was the right move, as you could tell Cade had a whole lot more power under him this past season compared to his rookie year.

Stepping back and listening to what Langdon has said about taking on contracts, he seems focused on bringing in vets who can aid in developing our young players.

In his intro presser, he talks a bit about it at about the [42-minute mark](https://www.youtube.com/live/-CMaT3qcX_0?si=Fh8OWXzz1zIjMQzh&amp;t=2506) by stating,

&gt; I think that is one thing we are looking for, is with the cap space that we do have is bringing in contracts maybe from other teams and gathering assets as well. And hopefully with those players that come in they can, as I've said before, they can bolster the growth of our youth

In a [follow up interview](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKVMa7EUD5c&amp;t=167s) he expands on that idea further, and talks about how he wants to bring in vets who can help bolster our youth both on and off the court, saying

&gt; guys can help, again, can help the growth of understanding the game between the lines, in practice, recovery, nutrition, off the floor, all those things are going to impact the growth of our players and put them in position to reach their potential. I think if our young players can reach their potential with the addition of these, you know, veteran leaders, I think we'll be a pretty good team.

Thought it was worth sharing all this. Everything I've heard Langdon say speaks towards focusing in on who he sees as our core young group and providing the best resources he can to develop them. Is THJ that type of vet? I have no clue, but the bit of history between him and Cade seems to fit that mold.",DetroitPistons,12,https://www.reddit.com/r/DetroitPistons/comments/1dqwola/thj_cade_and_what_langdon_has_said_about_bringing/

2023-12-17,1702829821,Tips to Maintain Piston Health and Engine Performance,"Hey guys, just wanted to share some helpful tips Ive collected over the years on how to maintain piston health and overall engine performance for your vehicle. Hope this helps someone avoid physical and/or mental health damages caused by their pistons. 

Regular Oil Changes: If your pistons have a horrible training staff that do zero preventive maintenance, your team will be crippled and your star 20 yr old center wont see the light of day. Ensure timely maintenance to keep the engine lubricated and reduce friction on the pistons.

Quality Oil: Running a semi-functional basketball team above a JV high school level requires quality players with talent greater than your local LA Fitness. Use high-quality oil with the recommended viscosity for your engine.

Air Filter Maintenance: A piss poor team culture built on tanking and misfit toys should be regularly cleaned out and taken to the trash. Replace or clean air filters regularly to prevent contaminants from reaching the engine and causing damage to the pistons.

Avoid Over-revving: Rev your engine within recommended limits and avoid multiple 20+ game losing streaks to prevent excessive wear and tear on the pistons and their fan base.

Regular Inspections: Periodically inspect your teams game plan and rotations for signs of delusion and self sabotage. Consistently benching your young star SG and SF on a 23+ game losing streak might indicate a problem with the pistons.

Remember, regular maintenance is key to ensuring the longevity and health of your engine's pistons.",DetroitPistons,4,https://www.reddit.com/r/DetroitPistons/comments/18kkqno/tips_to_maintain_piston_health_and_engine/

With that said I know some fans think trading Cade would net more in terms of picks or players. Some fans are weary of his health issues. Some fans just dont like him for whatever reason.

2024-10-06,1728228535,Killian Hayes birthday part 2,I know Hayes is spelt wrong o the cake,DetroitPistons,29,https://www.reddit.com/r/DetroitPistons/comments/1fxj2w2/killian_hayes_birthday_part_2/
2024-07-22,1721652444,This is the most optimistic Ive been with this team in nearly a decade&sigh&30+ wins? =O<þ,"I know we are expecting to crawl before we walk, 25+ wins is like a milestone compared to the last five seasons, and we have a huge influx of new players, coaches, and still a very young nucleus all trying to learn the game and fit with one another but Im getting a bit of excitement at what our team can and should look like next year. Add to the fact that the east play in race had the hawks as a 10th seed with just 36 wins and the 9th seed at only 39 if things work out we could make a nice sizable jump, possibly flirt with a play in seed, and still have a chance at a solid lotto pick in a loaded draft.

Also, the transparency between Trajans first off season compared to most of Troy Weavers is night and day. It doesnt feel like Trajan is just gathering his favorite unproven projects and throwing the ball on the floor. He has a plan, he picked a direction, and hes doing moves that seem to benefit not just Cade but Duren, Ivey, Ausar, and the rest of the team. Also that Fontecchio deal is A STEAL. Only moves I think I may question is the THJ + picks for Grimes because I believe a healthy grimes can be way better than what his limited game sample sized showed. Same time, Im not mad at shedding some of this youth in order to maximize others. Also, for the Jaden Ivey hive we might see what Ivey can actually be with a coach who not only wants to be here but has actual plans/insight on how he wants to use him.

Top it all off, I think Cade is on the rise and he can jump into some very promising conversations next year with vets like THJ, Tek, Beasley, Tobias (who I still dont understand why people act like 2-52 million was such a MASSIVE overpay when Miles Bridges DV case having ass got 3/75&) around. I also think a more motivated Duren that gives effort on the defensive end coupled with his offensive growth last year could be the back bone to an offense. Plus Fred Vinson is here to help Ausar, Ron, and others grow as shooters.

Im excited and Im scared because i dont want to get let down by this team. With that said, listening to all these podcasters and media guys mock us every year including this one is tiresome. I want to see Detroit start climbing out of the tank-hole and make some noise in the east. Vegas has us at 25.5 wins and I really think we can jump over that and become the promising young team we expected years ago.

2024-10-24,1729740131,"Game Recap (Player Performances, Takeaways, etc.): Pistons vs. Pacers (10/23/24)","The Pistons are back, and so am I! OK, melodrama aside, I'm back with my version of game recaps after terminally burning out last March on recaps in which invariably took major part some of the worst coaching the NBA has ever seen.

Though I did (generally) enjoy writing those recaps, they also required between 90 minutes and two hours apiece. I'm going to be trying a new format this season: recaps focused on player performance and general takeaways, with a weekly big-picture recap. I'll try to still work some video into these posts. In any case, here goes!

# Overall

The Pistons held a lead throughout the vast majority of this game before surrendering it for good partway through the 4th quarter and then falling apart down the stretch. This was by no means a bad loss. It was a close loss against a much more talented roster. Team defense was a pleasant surprise. The offense was rough.

There were certainly positives to this game. Perhaps first amongst those for fans was that it was very watchable basketball, of the sort this organization hasn't produced for many years now. Will it last? Early signs are encouraging. This wasn't the sort of fool's gold play that powered the roster early last season. The rotation is populated largely by functional NBA players, and those functional players were functionally coached. There were, of course, warts, particularly on the offensive end: the Pistons shot a mere 43% from the field and 27% from three. And it should be noted that though the Pistons did play strong defense, the Pacers also underperformed on offense. Still, this was a good start.

&amp;#x200B;

# Players

**Cade Cunningham (28p/9rb/8a, 10/23 FG, 2/6 3P, 6/6 FT):** Cade overcame what had the looks of another brutally slow season start to be the best player on the floor for the Pistons. His 26 points led the team by a large margin and included an impressive array of creation off the dribble. His playmaking was a bit quieter but still effective, to the tune of eight assists against three turnovers (a couple of those of the avoidable nature). He made a few errors on defense, but many less than he'd had a habit of making last season and during preseason.

Grade: **A-**

**Jaden Ivey (17p/5rb/4a, 5/13 FG, 0/2 3P, 7/9 FT):** Ivey found himself in foul trouble early on, and he'd play a fairly minor role in the offense. He had a not-so-efficient night from a scoring standpoint, though it didn't help matters that he was featured very little in the halfcourt. To his credit, the offense stayed afloat reasonably well when he played the lead role with Cade off the court, and he got to the free throw line on five occasions. He was largely invisible on defense, which came as a pleasant surprise: invisible means he's not being a problem. To wit, he was much better than usual -- if still not a positive presence, then at least not a hindrance. That's a good sign.

Grade: **B**

**Tim Hardaway Jr (14p/1rb/1a, 4/9 FG, 4/7 3P, 2/2 FT)**: Hardaway got the start and played his role -- he shot a lot of threes and hit most of them. Aside from a wasted possession in which he attempted to create a shot -- with predictable results -- he stuck to his job on offense did a solid job of it. He was surprisingly non-bad on defense.

Grade: **B+**

**Tobias Harris (13p/2rb/1a, 6/13 FG, 1/6 3PA):** Tobias had some good plays mixed with long stretches of invisibility. Alas, this is a common issue with Mr. Harris: he has a habit of disappearing if he isn't featured in the offense. He at times flashed his valuable ability to create a bucket when asked to; he also missed some key shots down the stretch. He held his own on defense; he got beaten cleanly near the basket a couple of times by Siakam, but that's not an uncommon occurrence for the average power forward. All told, the offense needed to be better. That's partly on him and it's partly on Bickerstaff, who needs to do a better job at keeping him involved. This is just how it is with Tobias; the front office knew it when they brought him on.

Grade: **C**

**Jalen Duren (13p/13rb/4a, 4/4 FG, 5/6 FT):** On the plus side, he scored a highly efficient 13 points, grabbed 13 rebounds, and dished four assists. On the minus, none of that came anywhere near to compensating for his ruinous cost on defense. The effort was certainly there, which was good to see; unfortunately, the acumen was not, and defensive acumen remains the chief question mark for Duren. His evening started decently enough -- not well, but decently -- before he completely fell apart in the second half. This was particularly by way of being victimized by Carlisle's perimeter sets with Myles Turner, whom Duren repeatedly left open, but his extensive catalogue of costly mistakes certainly did not end there. He capped off a dreadful defensive night by first allowing Siakam to beat him in transition for an easy bucket in the closing minutes, and then fouling Mathurin on a three-point attempt. Simply put, the Pistons need him to be better on defense. A great deal better.

Grade: **D+**

**Malik Beasley (14p/3rb/1a, 5/13 FG, 2/6 3PT, 2/3 FT):** Beasley had an inefficient night on offense -- particularly by the standard of a three-point specialist -- and was second only to Duren in cost on defense. Not a good first evening as a Piston for Malik.

Grade: **C-**

**Isaiah Stewart (2p/4rb/2a, 1/2 FG, 0/1 3PT)**: Stewart provided his usual brand of tough defense and hardnosed play. He was somewhat ill-utilized on offense, as Bickerstaff chose to use him to his weakness as a roll man rather than making use of more fitting pick-and-pop sets. Stewart would ultimately attempt only one three, and he missed it after a characteristic hesitation. Still, he'd hold the fort fairly ably on defense, even when matched up against much greater size in the form of Turner and Siakam. Much of what Isaiah does on defense isn't prominently evident, but he is highly disruptive. Likewise with what he does on offense, if less so. And he wasn't asked to do much on offense tonight.

Grade: **B**

**Simone Fontecchio (0p/1rb/0a, 0/4 FG, 0/2 3PT):** Through preseason and into the season opener, Fontecchio hasn't found his stroke. Perhaps he's still working back from offseason toe surgery. It's unlikely that his struggles will last forever, given his track record, but he's had a rough go of it so far. The defense was serviceable, and the ever-present work ethic was there, but the shot was not.

Grade: **C-**

**Ron Holland (6p/3brb/0a, 2/6 FG, 0/3 3PT, 2/2 FT):** If any confirmation were still required after preseason of Holland's rawness at the NBA level, this game provided it. Unsurprisingly, he largely held his own on defense. Equally unsurprisingly, he had exceedingly little to offer on offense. He can't shoot -- none of his threes came close to going in, and he passed up multiple other opportunities -- and he's as unrefined on the drive now as he was in the G-League. This is no knock against him; his rawness was known. It remains to be seen if he'll see significant minutes this season. Not a good game for Ron, though expectations should be low. It's unlikely that he'd have seen time on the court if not for Ausar Thompson's absence. He isn't ready.

Grade: **C**

&amp;#x200B;

# Takeaways

* This team is exceedingly likely to be enormously better coached than last season's. That was a given, but it was still nice to witness. Bickerstaff is nothing special, especially as an offensive mind. All the same, he'll be the best offensive coach this organization has had since Flip Saunders if he can manage to simply be roughly average in his coaching on that end.
* This roster is far more functional than the abomination that hit the floor on opening night a year ago.
* The veterans are likely to be helpful.
* Keep an eye on the center situation: Bickerstaff has made it clear that the starting job isn't simply Duren's by default. This is only one game, but Duren will need to be considerably better on defense if he's to lay long-term claim to the job.

&amp;#x200B;

# Rotations

* Outside of an appearance by Marcus Sasser brought on by Ivey's foul trouble in the first half, the usage of Cade and Ivey followed the expected pattern: Cade and Ivey began and finished halves together; Ivey left the floor sooner than Cade; and Ivey returned to the floor when Cade departed.
* Amusingly, Bickerstaff fielded an all-bench lineup for a short time in the first half due to Ivey's foul trouble (he was replaced by Sasser). The lineup was, however, reasonably functional, and it did reasonably well. All-bench lineups aren't inherently bad -- but they're certainly bad if they're ineffectual lineups that are terribly coached and are persistently fielded despite being consistently disastrous. Anyway, not much to see here.
* Unsurprisingly, Ron Holland spent the vast majority of his time on the floor alongside Isaiah Stewart. Even if Stewart wasn't used much as a spacer, at least he's capable of shooting it.

&amp;#x200B;

# Shot selection

https://preview.redd.it/uega3ex8fmwd1.png?width=336&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3e2f018ac6ae4eb82cb0b5904bb70d9ace94eae4

* See all those scary red X marks in the interior? Those are the Pistons attempting midrange offense they shouldn't be attempting. Cade and Tobias can hit those shots reasonably well. Nobody else in this rotation can.

&amp;#x200B;

# Facts of note

* The NBA front office (specifically Joe Dumars) made reference over the summer to making offense a little less potent. The refs were most certainly letting the players play tonight. Related? Let's hope so!

&amp;#x200B;

# Awards

* **Most valuable**: Cade Cunningham powered the offense. Nobody else came close.
* **Runner-up:** Tim Hardaway Jr. provided the most overall value outside of Cade.
* **Struggled most:** Notwithstanding his raw stats and efficiency, Duren was painful to have on the floor. Center is the role with the most defensive impact, and his was roundly negative.

&amp;#x200B;

Check out the defensive rotations on these sequences. Encouraging stuff! The Pistons played pretty solid team defense tonight despite having few strong individual defenders. Kudos to Bickerstaff.

Cade did some impressive creating off the dribble, including in the post. This is dangerous work if he can keep it up.

And the play of the game: Duren has his issues, but his fantastic athleticism on lobs is always a joy to watch, and so is his chemistry with Cade on the pick-and-roll:

2023-11-04,1699080074,We have seen this movie directed by Monty Williams before...and it was beautiful,"What Monty is doing with Jaden Ivey is not new.

[He did it to his most beloved Phoenix Sun.](https://arizonasports.com/story/2498930/suns-mikal-bridges-appreciative-of-monty-williams-tough-love/)

During his rookie season in 2018-19, Mikal Bridges started 56 of 82 regular season games, averaging 8.3 points., 3.2 rebounds, 2.1 assists, 1.6 steals, and 0.5 blocks. He was trending up, being asked to play 33.6 mpg post-All Star Break. Suns fans expected him to be part of the starting lineup for the 2019-20 season along with Booker and Ayton as the core of the future.

Monty Williams came in as new coach in 2019-20. Bridges, working hard in the offseason that [he did not go home to Pennsylvania and spent his off-time in Phoenix](https://www.nba.com/suns/features/bridges-spends-offseason-phoenix-connects-coach-monty-williams), expected that he would start and play major minutes.

Did not happen. First game, came off the bench, played only 23 minutes. From October to November 2019, never started a game, averaging less than 20 minutes of playtime, his production dropping to 5.9 ppg. He was asked to play behind Dario Saric at the 4, who at the time was a PF coming from a relatively disappointing season with the Wolves after promising early seasons in Philadelphia.

Unlike Ivey who is being challenged to improve on the defensive end, Bridges was challenged by Monty to work harder on improving his offensive game. Mikal shot horribly as he tried to work on his shot, with an unsightly 14.3 3P% in his first five games of 2019-20. It was around that time that Mikal talked to Monty demanding he be played more minutes and Monty gave him an honest assessment of what he needs to work on before he becomes a starter. Mikal put in the work to meet Monty's demands and he improved. From December 2019 up to the game before he got his shot to be the regular starter, his 3P% climbed to 36.1%.

In his 47th game of his sophomore season, Mikal Bridges finally wrestled away the regular starting spot from Dario Saric, who was then averaging 9.9 points, 6.1 rebounds, 1.9 assists, with a 31.9 3P%. Never looking back and already a more complete player, Bridges finished the season as a starter for the Suns as a two-way menace hitting 40% from three. And as we all know, he continued to be the regular starter of the Suns, I would even daresay the real heart of the team, until the fateful day he was traded for Kevin Durant which made Monty Williams cry.

TLDR: What Monty Williams seems to be doing to Jaden Ivey is the same thing he did to Mikal Bridges, his favorite Sun. It is up to Jaden how he will respond to the challenge. Either he emerges ala Mikal, a complete and better player, or like Ayton, who took Monty's challenge as a personal slight, delusional of his DominAyton.

BTW, Monty got this tough love mindset from [Coach Pop](https://www.azcentral.com/story/sports/nba/suns/2021/12/08/tough-love-key-unbreakable-gregg-popovich-monty-williams-bond/6428435001/) .",DetroitPistons,80,https://www.reddit.com/r/DetroitPistons/comments/17nfsf2/we_have_seen_this_movie_directed_by_monty/

I hope that the fans can move on from negative cloud that has hovered over Dumars name since his tenure ended with the Pistons. He always represented with the franchise with great class. Everything this franchise has ever accomplished was done in large part to his contributions.

2023-11-28,1701138638,Rock Fucking Bottom,"Blown out by the other worst team in the NBA&at home. This is rock fucking bottom. Im absolutely disgusted.

A proud franchise with championship history shouldnt be this bad. But they are, and everyone is to blame. 

Everyone has given Troy Weaver every excuse possible. I get it, he inherited a shitty situation. But its year four. Time is up. Were still just as shitty as when we started. Were the least talented team in the NBA and its not close. You cant just build a team exclusively through the draft. There are no adults in the room. Cade, Duren and Ausar are future stars that cant shine because the roster around them are young and incompetent. We have added ZERO draft capital and exclusively use our salary cap on washed players or backup centers.

And our dogshit owner Tom Gores needs to get the fuck out. I pray to GOD some journalist finds dirt on that fuckhead, drags him through the mud and force him to sell. He doesnt give a fuck about Detroit and makes two appearances a year where hes absolutely blackout on the court. He got Blake Griffin and Monty because it made it look like he was actually doing something, but has set this franchise back so much. He's fucking embarrassing.

Stop buying tickets to games. Get angry online. Force change. This is rock fucking bottom and they need to hear their fans frustration.

2024-04-11,1712879049,The last game of the year should be historic.,"The season is over, we're the worst team in the league. For game 82, let's let Ivey score 102. 

Every offensive play should be designed to let Ivey score. Everything from 3 point chucks, four player pick and rolls, hunt for free throws. Hell, go full globe trotter out there. 

And for defense? Don't play it. The goal is to get the ball back in Ivey's hands as soon as possible. Open the lane for the opponent and don't protect the arch. The goal is to persuade them to score as quickly as possible to potentially open a fast break opportunity for Ivey. I don't care if they score 200 and we lose by 80, that's not goal. The goal is to maximize Ivey's shot attempts so he can hit 102 on even the shittiest efficiency.

The league would hate it, most fans would hate it, and you wouldn't be able to find a bigger asterisk in the record book. However, over time all the negative feelings and asterisks would fade away. What wouldn't fade away though, is the fact that Jaden Ivey has the highest scoring game in NBA history.

Born on February 18, 1983, in Chicago, Illinois, Maxiell played college basketball at the University of Cincinnati before being selected by the Detroit Pistons with the 26th overall pick in the 2005 NBA Draft. Standing at 6 feet 7 inches, Maxiell made a name for himself as a power forward known for his shot-blocking ability and willingness to do the dirty work in the paint. He spent the majority of his career with the Pistons, where he played from 2005 to 2013, contributing to the team's success with his defensive prowess and high-energy play. Maxiell later had brief stints with the Orlando Magic and Charlotte Bobcats before ultimately retiring from professional basketball.

2023-10-29,1698546205,"Thank you, Dwane Casey","I have a hot take.

Thank you, Dwane Casey.

The way the team plays right now seems night and day with last season. But you don't see this much growth overnight if the fundamentals were not set in place.

That Casey defense forcing them to switch all the time? They are not implementing that right now but our guys have become switchable.

Bagley has been known to be terribad at defense. But he is passable now, something which started to be corrected since transferring to Detroit.

The boys also seem to be coachable and are reportedly hardworking. And they have this college team camaraderie, having each other's back.

I also remember when Stew had his Lebron incident. Casey asked him what he wants to be known for. Stew never got into trouble afterwards. Nobody in this team is actually getting into trouble.

And he never threw his players under the bus.

So I am grateful for Monty Williams because we can obviously see the effects of his coaching on how our team plays now. But I think much of the character this team developed was also because of Casey who coached them in, frankly, a lose-lose situation for his reputation. It is hard to be a coach in a purposeful tanking situation while still teaching good habits to the young guys and Casey did that with grace even if it did not manifest during his tenure. He committed career suicide when he agreed to stay on despite being put in a situation he did not sign up for.",DetroitPistons,22,https://www.reddit.com/r/DetroitPistons/comments/17it7ms/thank_you_dwane_casey/

Coby White's Numbers from 2019-2023.

His improvement has actually been ongoing since his 3rd season, but his attempts went way up this year with minutes and now we get to see more of it.

Jaden Ivey has a MUCH higher ceiling than Coby White, and I think a work ethic as high as anyone in the league.  Giving up on Ivey and watching him do this for some other team would be humiliating.  I am old enough to remember Middleton in a Piston's jersey, do NOT give up on Jaden Ivey just to lose the trade and sell low.

Ive been a fan of this team since 06, when I started watching basketball and fell in love with our beloved team on a stupid video game in my small town in the middle of nowhere, Canada. Ive literally never met another Pistons fan in my life here. I buy league pass every year, mostly just for the Pistons since Im <è<æ and dont get them on TV.

Ive stuck with it through decades of awful shit. Charlie V contracts and Iverson trades and Leuer signings and Kennard over Mitchell and all of it.

I am loyal. I am anything but fairweather which, if youre reading this, you likely are too.

All of that to say: If we bring on Miles Bridges, Im done. You can call me a virtue signaller or whatever youd like, I truly dont care. Im not participating in it anymore. Done done.

Until he and the front office who signs him are gone, I will not be a fan. Ill find someone else to root for. Cant do it. Wont be me.",DetroitPistons,101,https://www.reddit.com/r/DetroitPistons/comments/19dg2uv/im_good_on_miles_bridges_actually/

2024-06-27,1719449109,"John Hollinger's blurb from The Athletic on Ron Holland, his #1 overall this year","Ron Holland? Yes, Ron Holland. Lets start with the negatives first:

Holland only measured 6-6 1/2 at the NBA Draft Combine, he shot a ghastly 24 percent from 3 in the G League, and his avert-your-eyes start to the G League season  including an 11-turnover game  had scouts shuddering.

Now, for the good news: He came into the year as the top-rated player on most boards, had better numbers with G League Ignite than any other one-and-done in its history & and somehow went careening down draft boards anyway, even in a draft year where absolutely nobody came in and claimed the top spot for themselves.

I dont really get it. The biggest complaint with Holland is his lack of efficiency, but that was baked in the second Ignite built this roster. Virtually any teenager put in a situation where he has to carry a 30 percent usage rate is going to struggle; we saw it with LaMelo Ball in Australia and Scoot Henderson in Portland. Holland was no different, especially since hes not a natural point guard in the first place. Playing on a team with no real creator, he often had to call his own number against loaded-up defenses.

Did he get tunnel vision once he put it on the floor? Absolutely. Was it so tragic to rule him out versus other non-overwhelming options? I dont think so, especially as the season wore on.

Holland's numbers stack up well against Jalen Greens with Ignite and are superior to every other Ignite perimeter player who has come through. That happened despite Holland missing the final two months of the season, when his increasing experience would have given him an edge and when the rest of the G League is at its most depleted due to call-ups and fewer assignment players.

In his Ignite season, Green posted a 15.4 PER with 61.3 percent true shooting; Holland had a 15.8 PER on 56.5 percent. The shooting numbers were bad, but Green played on a more coherent team and thus also was only asked to carry a 23 percent usage rate at this level, not Hollands 28 percent. Also, keep in mind that Hollands free-throw rate was pretty massive for a perimeter player; four free-throw attempts per game may not seem like much until you remember the G League shoots one attempt that counts for two points. Only 10 players in the whole G League matched his rate. And even with Hollands brutal early turnover issues, his assist and turnover rates were essentially the same as Greens age-18 season.

Green would be the No. 1 pick in this draft; I think Holland should be too.

The other reason to like Holland is his defense. His 3.5 percent steal rate stands out; some iffy gambles spiked the total, but there is real talent (and fire) on this end. Overall, his rates of rebounds, steals and blocks compare favorably to former Ignite lottery pick Dyson Daniels, for instance, who has now become an awesome defender at the NBA level. I think Holland has similar pathways to being elite at this end.

On top of that, theres the good ol eye test. Ive seen Holland shoot a ton, both before games and during them, having watched him in person several times over the last year. He has a low push shot that needs some work, but hes also not a 24 percent 3-point shooter. His 72.8 percent mark from the line is a more accurate tell on where he stands as a shooter  he isn't Stephen Curry, but his shot isnt broken either. Just reaching the point where he makes one in three would make him a potent two-way wing, and that feels attainable.

Lastly, consider Hollands age. With a July 2005 birthdate, hes nearly a full year younger than several other players vying for places with him in the high lottery: He's six months younger than Rob Dillingham, nine months younger than Stephon Castle or Matas Buzelis and more than a year younger than Donovan Clingan and Reed Sheppard. Teams get caught on class year, but birth year is what matters.

It's not a slam dunk, and you could make a credible case for several players, but Holland has been the top player on my board since the 2023 Hoop Summit. He still has the best overall résumé.",DetroitPistons,59,https://www.reddit.com/r/DetroitPistons/comments/1dpef72/john_hollingers_blurb_from_the_athletic_on_ron/

On December 30th, the Pistons got their first win in 2 months, and fans flooded Wingstop.


The result?


Wingstop made $19,000,000 in net income that quarter, a massive 46% jump from the previous quarter. And it didn't end there.


In late January, Giannis went viral for trying to scan a QR code mid-game to get free Wingstop wings. Then a couple weeks later, he posted a video of himself boarding a plane to All-Star Weekend with a huge bag of Wingstops lemon pepper wings.


The result?


Wingstop stock reached an 80% increase compared to 6 months ago. Of course its not all because of the NBA, but the free marketing didnt hurt.


The Pistons may be the ultimate losers this season, but they created the ultimate winners: Wingstop.

Imagine Isaiah Stewart absolutely loaded on cocaine going apeshit on Giannis. Now imagine the whole starting lineup on cocaine, fucking yelling, screaming and punching the ever living shit out of the other team. This could possibly lead to more opportunities with the ball, and will effectively lead to more scoring opportunities. Highsaiah Stewart and his teammates will effectively scare the other team into not playing defense. The drugs will enhance their performance, turning dogshit like Killian Hayes into top level 2-way players. The pistons can always sue if the NBA tried to enforce drug tests, as it would be a violation of HIPAA rights, as any results should be kept confidential and will not be made known to the rest of the league. Even if they do, who fucking cares at this point. The pistons would gain a tremendous offensive and defensive advantage and therefore win many more games.
